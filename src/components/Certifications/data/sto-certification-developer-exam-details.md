The following is a detailed list of exam objectives:

| #   | Objective |
|-----|-----------|
| 1   | **Introduction to Harness Security Testing Orchestration** |
| 1.1 | Explain the importance of security testing in modern software development. |
| 1.2 | Describe the common issues in current security testing practices, including manual and standalone scanning, slow identification of vulnerabilities, siloed visibility, and inconsistent governance. |
| 2   | **Setting up the Environment** |
| 2.1 | Install and configure Harness Security Testing Orchestration on a local development environment. |
| 2.2 | Connect Harness Security Testing Orchestration to version control systems (e.g., Git) and CI/CD pipelines, emphasizing the integration aspect to address manual and standalone scanning. |
| 3   | **Creating Test Plans** |
| 3.1 | Create a basic security test plan using Harness Security Testing Orchestration. |
| 3.2 | Define test scenarios, including target applications, endpoints, and test inputs, with a focus on automation to eliminate delays. |
| 4   | **Test Automation** |
| 4.1 | Implement basic security tests, such as OWASP Top Ten vulnerabilities scanning, and automate them within CI/CD pipelines to address the issue of delayed identification of vulnerabilities. |
| 4.2 | Integrate third-party security testing tools into Harness Security Testing Orchestration to expand automated scanning capabilities. |
| 5   | **Test Execution and Reporting** |
| 5.1 | Execute security tests within a CI/CD pipeline as gate checks, ensuring that vulnerabilities are identified before release. |
| 5.2 | Analyze and interpret security test results and generate reports, promoting visibility into vulnerabilities throughout the development process. |
| 6   | **Integration and Extensibility** |
| 6.1 | Customize security testing workflows in Harness Security Testing Orchestration to align with specific release processes, addressing inconsistent governance. |
| 6.2 | Integrate additional security testing tools or plugins seamlessly to consolidate scanning efforts. |
| 7   | **Security Best Practices** |
| 7.1 | Apply security best practices to code and infrastructure within the CI/CD pipeline, ensuring that scans are integrated into the release process. |
| 7.2 | Implement security testing as an integral part of the software development lifecycle, avoiding siloed visibility. |
| 8   | **Compliance and Regulations** |
| 8.1 | Understand and adhere to relevant compliance standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) in security testing. |
| 8.2 | Ensure that security testing processes align with regulatory requirements, emphasizing the importance of integration and governance. |
| 9   | **Troubleshooting and Debugging** |
| 9.1 | Identify and resolve common issues and errors in security testing, including problems related to integration and automation. |
| 9.2 | Debug integration problems between Harness Security Testing Orchestration and other tools to maintain a smooth CI/CD pipeline. |
| 10  | **Performance Optimization** |
| 10.1 | Optimize security testing processes for efficiency and speed within the CI/CD pipeline. |
| 10.2 | Implement caching and parallelization strategies for security tests to address the issue of speed and delays in vulnerability identification. |
