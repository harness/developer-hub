title: Your first chaos experiment execution using APIs
description: Executing a chaos experiment on Kubernetes for the first time using APIs.
---

Welcome to Harness chaos engineering's tutorial on running a chaos experiment using APIs. In this tutorial, you will execute a chaos experiment on Kubernetes for the first time!
You can access the Harness API documentation [here](https://apidocs.harness.io/). 
We will use the publicly available [Harness CE Postman collection](https://elements.getpostman.com/redirect?entityId=25469526-59b35825-6240-4b45-9974-6bb869741318&entityType=collection) to describe the chaos APIs used in this tutorial.

Let's get started!

## What is chaos engineering?

Chaos engineering is a DevOps practice that involves proactive, controlled experimentation on a system to identify weak points and misconfiguration, gain insights into how the system behaves in turbulent conditions, and improve the system’s resilience. The system typically comprises the application under test and all the components on which it depends, such as databases, networks, infrastructure, and cloud native services.

Chaos engineering is relevant to all types of systems, including legacy applications and infrastructure. However, it assumes greater significance in deployments involving cloud native applications, which inherently carry multiple points of failure because of their distributed and elastic nature.

## Typical chaos experimentation workflow
Chaos experiments target a steady-state system and simulate conditions that might induce failure in components such as infrastructure, networks, and services. For example, a Chaos experiment might terminate a pod in a functional Kubernetes cluster, shut down a working load balancer to validate failover, or induce CPU spikes on a server, and then observe how the system responds. 
 
In a chaos experiment, you typically perform the following tasks:
1. Define and apply a steady state to the test system and specify its service-level objectives (SLOs). 
2. Develop a hypothesis on how the system will behave if you inject a specific fault.
3. Inject the fault.
4. Observe whether the system continues to meet the SLOs.

Harness Chaos Engineering (HCE) simplifies the chaos engineering practices for your organization. To get started, create a new project or ask your administrator to add you to an existing project. Once you have access, navigate to the **Chaos** tab that shows an overview of all the experiment runs.

![HCE Overview](./static/first-chaos/hce-overview.png)

## Prerequisites to run your first chaos experiment using APIs

Below are the required inputs and how to access (or generate) them. We will refer to these variables in the API requests explained below.

1. **url**
This is the Harness CE server URL that serves the chaos API requests. You can find this URL in the chaos API documentation.
For instance, [this](https://app.harness.io/gateway/chaos/manager/api/query) is the Harness CE server URL for production environment.
If you are using [chaos Postman collection](https://elements.getpostman.com/redirect?entityId=25469526-59b35825-6240-4b45-9974-6bb869741318&entityType=collection), this value will be pre-filled in 2 Postman variables as shown below:
```
base_url - https://app.harness.io
chaos_url - {{base_url}}/gateway/chaos/manager/api/query
```

2. **account_id**
This is your Harness account ID. Specify the account where you wish to run chaos experiments.

You can retrieve your account ID from the below steps:
1. Go to `ACCOUNT SETTINGS` in [Harness](https://app.harness.io/).
2. Click on `Overview`.
3. Copy the value of `Account ID`.

3. **project_id**
This is your Harness project ID. Specify the project where you wish to run chaos experiments.

You can retrieve your project ID from the below steps:
1. Go to `Projects` in [Harness](https://app.harness.io/).
2. Select the project where you wish to run the chaos experiments or create a new project.
3. Click on `Overview`.
4. Copy the value of `ID`.
5. Ensure that you copy the value of `Organization` since this is required for variable `org_id`.


4. **org_id**
This is your Harness organization ID. Specify the organization where you wish to run chaos experiments.

You can retrieve your organization Id by following the below steps:
**See above step to retrieve project_id - you would have copied the value of org_id as well in that step, if not please follow the same steps again to retrieve organization Id**

5. **API-KEY-TOKEN**

You can use an existing Harness API key token from the same Harness account that you used in the previous steps or create a new API key token from the below steps:
1. Click on `MY PROFILE` in [Harness](https://app.harness.io/).
2. Go to `My API Keys` and click on `+ API Key` to create a new API Key.
3. Enter a `Name` for the API Key (optional description/tags) and click on `Save`.
4. Under the newly created API Key, click on `+ Token` to generate a new token for this API Key.
5. Enter the `Name` and select the `Expiration` (time for which this token is valid) and click on `Generate Token`.
6. Ensure that you copy the value of the token generated and store it safe, because you won't be able to access this later.

## Variables in Harness CE Postman collection
In order to work with Harness CE Postman collection, fork it under your Postman account and update the required variables.
![Variables In Harness CE Postman Collection](./static/first-chaos-via-API/postman_variables.png)

## Authorization header for API request
An authorization header with API-KEY-TOKEN value retrieved from above steps is required to work with chaos APIs. 
```
x-api-key: $API-KEY-TOKEN
```
![Authorization Header For API Request](./static/first-chaos-via-API/authorization_header.png)

## Add a chaos infrastructure

Create (or register) a chaos infrastructure (Kubernetes infrastructure) that injects faults into the application (or service).

1. Specify a name for the chaos infrastructure and provide description and tags (description and tags are optional).
2. Choose the mode of installation for the Harness delegate. Harness delegate is a remote agent to access your Kubernetes cluster resources and inject faults into them as a part of a chaos experiment. 
3. **Cluster Wide** installation mode allows you to target resources across all the namespaces in your cluster whereas **Namespace Mode** installation restricts injecting chaos to a certain namespace in which the delegate will be installed.

In this tutorial, the delegate will be installed in the **hce** namespace in **Cluster Wide** mode.

A sample GraphQL query and GraphQL variables to register/create a chaos infrastructure is shown below:

GraphQL query: `registerInfra`
```
mutation($identifiers: IdentifiersRequest!, $request: RegisterInfraRequest!) {
  registerInfra(identifiers: $identifiers, request: $request) {
    token
    infraID
    name
    manifest
  }
}
```

GraphQL variables: `registerInfra`
```
{
  "identifiers": {
    "orgIdentifier": "{{org_id}}",
    "accountIdentifier": "{{account_id}}",
    "projectIdentifier": "{{project_id}}"
  },
  "request": {
    "name": "my-test-chaos-infra",
    "environmentID": "my-test-chaos-env",
    "description": "Test Chaos Environment",
    "platformName": "my-test-platform",
    "infraNamespace": "hce",
    "serviceAccount": "hce",
    "infraScope": "cluster",
    "infraNsExists": false,
    "infraSaExists": false,
    "installationType": "MANIFEST",
    "skipSsl": false
  }
}
```

The above mentioned values are pre-filled in Harness CE Postman collection as shown in the below screenshot:
![Register Chaos Infrastructure](./static/first-chaos-via-API/register_infra.png)

A sample response: `registerInfra`
```
{
  "data": {
    "registerInfra": {
      "token": "abc123",
      "infraID": "abc123",
      "name": "abc123",
      "manifest": "abc123"
    }
  }
}
```

Note down the value of field `token` and `infraID` from response, since they will be used in the subsequent API calls.

Once the request has been executed, you can retrieve the infrastructure manifest by forming URL as shown below:
```
$chaos_server_url/file/$token.yaml
``` 
where
* `$chaos_server_url` corresponds to `https://app.harness.io/gateway/chaos/manager/api/` ; and
* `$token` corresponds to the token value retrieved in response to the `registerInfra` API call as shown in the sample response above.

An example URL to retrieve infrastructure manifest is shown below:
```
https://app.harness.io/gateway/chaos/manager/api/file/token-abc.yaml
```

Copy and save the YAML file on a machine that has `kubectl` installed and has access to your K8s cluster in a file named `infra.yaml`.

You can deploy your chaos infrastructure by executing the below commands if you have access to your Kubernetes cluster via [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/):
```
kubectl apply -f infra.yaml
```

The delegate will be set up in the K8s cluster. To check the status of your infrastructure, use the API `GetInfraDetails` which will be described in the section below.


## Check the status of chaos infrastructure

Use the `getInfraDetails` query to retrieve the details of your newly registered infrastructure.

A sample GraphQL query and GraphQL variables to retrieve details of a chaos infrastructure is shown below:

GraphQL query: `getInfraDetails`
```
query GetInfraDetails(
  $infraID: String!,
  $identifiers: IdentifiersRequest!
) {
  getInfraDetails(
    infraID: $infraID,
    identifiers: $identifiers
  ) {
    infraID
    name
    description
    tags
    environmentID
    platformName
    isActive
    isInfraConfirmed
    isRemoved
    updatedAt
    createdAt
    noOfSchedules
    noOfWorkflows
    token
    infraNamespace
    serviceAccount
    infraScope
    infraNsExists
    infraSaExists
    installationType
    k8sConnectorID
    lastWorkflowTimestamp
    startTime
    version
    createdBy {
      userID
      username
      email
    }
    updatedBy {
      userID
      username
      email
    }
  }
}
```

GraphQL variables: `getInfraDetails`
```
{
  "identifiers": {
    "orgIdentifier": "{{org_id}}",
    "accountIdentifier": "{{account_id}}",
    "projectIdentifier": "{{project_id}}"
  },
  "infraID": "{{your-infra-ID}}"
}
```
**Note:** Ensure that you update the value of the `infraID` field retrieved during the `registerInfra` API call.

A sample response: `getInfraDetails`
```
{
  "data": {
    "getInfraDetails": {
      "infraID": "4",
      "name": "xyz789",
      "description": "xyz789",
      "tags": ["xyz789"],
      "environmentID": "xyz789",
      "platformName": "xyz789",
      "isActive": true,
      "isInfraConfirmed": true,
      "isRemoved": true,
      "updatedAt": "xyz789",
      "createdAt": "xyz789",
      "noOfSchedules": 123,
      "noOfWorkflows": 123,
      "token": "abc123",
      "infraNamespace": "xyz789",
      "serviceAccount": "abc123",
      "infraScope": "xyz789",
      "infraNsExists": false,
      "infraSaExists": false,
      "installationType": "CONNECTOR",
      "k8sConnectorID": "xyz789",
      "lastWorkflowTimestamp": "xyz789",
      "startTime": "abc123",
      "version": "abc123",
      "createdBy": UserDetails,
      "updatedBy": UserDetails
    }
  }
}
```
Check the value of `isActive` field and ensure it is set to `true` i.e. the infrastructure is in `active` state before moving further.

Above values are pre-filled in Harness CE Postman Collection as shown below:

![Get Infra Details](./static/first-chaos-via-API/get_infra_details.png)

To run this API using Harness CE Postman collection, update the value of the `infraID` variable retrieved during `registerInfra` API call.

## Create a demo application and an observability infrastructure

You are all set to inject chaos into your Kubernetes resources. You will execute one of the most popular faults, i.e. **Pod Delete**. This fault deletes the pods of a deployment (or a statefulset or a daemonset) to determine the resilience of a microservice. 

You can use your own application as a target, or use the [online boutique](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo) microservices demo application as the target. In this tutorial, you will use the online boutique application. 

You can install the boutique application (also known as target application) and observability infrastructure (optional) which includes Grafana, Prometheus and a BlackBox exporter, using the below commands. The observability infrastructure provides a dashboard to validate the health of the application microservices in real time.

```bash
❯ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chaosnative/harness-chaos-demo/main/boutique-app-manifests/manifest/app.yaml -n hce

❯ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chaosnative/harness-chaos-demo/main/boutique-app-manifests/manifest/monitoring.yaml -n hce
```

These resources will be deployed in the existing `hce` namespace.
The target application and the observability infrastructure pods will be available in the `hce` namespace eventually. Below is a command that fetches all the pods in the `hce` namespace.
```
❯ kubectl get pods -n hce

To access the target application frontend in your browser, use the `CLUSTER-IP` of the `frontend-external` LoadBalancer service.

![Online Boutique](./static/first-chaos/online-boutique.png)

To access the Grafana dashboard, 
1. Login using the default credentials: username `admin` and password `admin`.
2. Browse the online boutique application dashboard. 

Before fault execution, all the metrics indicate normal application behavior.

![Grafana App Dashboard](./static/first-chaos/grafana-app-dashboard.png)

## Construct a chaos experiment

You have successfully created and deployed the target application. You can now target the pods of the cart microservice using the pod delete fault. 
Before injecting chaos, the cart page will be accessible from the frontend, as seen at the `/cart` route.

![Online Boutique App Cart](./static/first-chaos/online-boutique-app-cart.png)

To create the chaos experiment, 
1. Specify the experiment name and optionally a description and tags.
2. Add the target infrastructure ID that you previously created.

This allows you to create your chaos experiment with a pod delete fault that is configured to target the online boutique application.

You can use the `createChaosWorkFlow` API to create the above chaos experiment.

GraphQL query: `createChaosWorkFlow`
```
mutation CreateChaosWorkFlow(
  $request: ChaosWorkFlowRequest!
  $identifiers: IdentifiersRequest!
) {
  createChaosWorkFlow(request: $request, identifiers: $identifiers) {
    workflowID
    cronSyntax
    workflowName
    workflowDescription
    isCustomWorkflow
    tags
  }
}
```

GraphQL variables: `createChaosWorkFlow`
```
{
   "identifiers": {
    "orgIdentifier": "{{org_id}}",	
    "accountIdentifier": "{{account_id}}",
    "projectIdentifier": "{{project_id}}"
  },
  "request": {
    "workflowManifest": "$your-new-workflow-manifest",
    "cronSyntax": "",
    "workflowName": "my-pod-delete-experiment",
    "workflowDescription": "This is a cartservice pod delete experiment",
    "weightages": [
      {
        "experimentName": "pod-delete-ji5",
        "weightage": 10
      }
    ],
    "isCustomWorkflow": true,
    "infraID": "{{your-infra-id-from-registerInfra-call}}",
    "tags":["test", "workflow", "gke"]
  }
}
```
**Note:** 
To run this API using Harness CE Postman collection, update the value of the `infraID` variable retrieved using the `registerInfra` API call.
The value for `workflowManifest` field is pre-filled in the Harness CE Postman collection. You will need to update this if you are using a different application, other than boutique.

A sample workflow manifest is shown below:
```
{
    "kind": "Workflow",
    "apiVersion": "argoproj.io/v1alpha1",
    "metadata": {
        "name": "my-pod-delete-experiment",
        "namespace": "hce",

        "labels": {
            "infra_id": "e640346b-bff5-40db-a828-68b44e06e2d1",
            "revision_id": "f82e8c99-8efd-4289-a324-eadfd9667574",
            "workflow_id": "80557c8b-531c-49d2-a39e-9f72c4674c2c",
            "workflows.argoproj.io/controller-instanceid": "e640346b-bff5-40db-a828-68b44e06e2d1"
        }
    },

                "inputs": {},
                "outputs": {},
                "metadata": {},
                "steps": [
                    [
                        {
                            "name": "install-chaos-faults",
                            "template": "install-chaos-faults",
                            "arguments": {}
                        }
                    ],
                    [

**Note:** 
To use your own workflow manifest instead of the default manifest from the Postman collection, escape the JSON manifest before providing it as a value to the `workflowManifest` variable.

A sample response: `createChaosWorkFlow`
```
{
  "data": {
    "createChaosWorkFlow": {
      "workflowID": "xyz789",
      "identifiers": Identifiers,
      "cronSyntax": "abc123",
      "workflowName": "abc123",
      "workflowDescription": "xyz789",
      "isCustomWorkflow": false,
      "tags": ["abc123"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Note:**
Note the value of the `workflowID`, which will be required for subsequent API calls.

Now, you can inspect the configuration used to create a chaos workflow. 
You will target the cart microservice of the boutique application. The application is housed in the `hce` namespace with the `app=cartservice` application label (corresponds to cart microservice). Specify the application kind as `deployment`

```
spec:
  appinfo:
    appns: hce
    applabel: app=cartservice
    appkind: deployment
```

Take a look at the **fault parameters**. 
* The fault execution duration is defined as `30` seconds with an interval of `10` seconds. This means that, in every `10` seconds, the cart microservice pod(s) are deleted for a total of `30` seconds. 
* The ramp time is set to `empty` and is `0` by default. This ramp time refers to the period that the fault waits before and after injecting chaos into the application. 
* The pod affected percentage is set to `empty`, and is `1` by default. This parameter specifies the number of pods in the cart deployment that will be targeted.
```
  experiments:
    - name: pod-delete
      spec:
        components:
          env:
            - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
              value: "30"
            - name: CHAOS_INTERVAL
              value: "10"
            - name: FORCE
              value: "false"
            - name: PODS_AFFECTED_PERC
              value: ""
```

Now take a look at the **Probes** config. 
* A probe named **http-cartservice-probe** is defined which is used to validate the availability of the `/cart` URL endpoint when the pod delete fault is executed. 
* You can see that the probe type is `HTTP` and it is executed in a `Continuous` mode throughout the fault execution. 
* In probe details section, you can see that the URL is `http://frontend/cart` and the response timeout is set to `15` milliseconds. 
* Probe execution makes GET requests to the specified URL. If no HTTP response is obtained within `15` milliseconds, it indicates probe failure. 
* If all the probe executions pass, this indicates that the probe passed.

```
probe:
  - name: http-cartservice-probe
    type: httpProbe
    mode: Continuous
    runProperties:
      probeTimeout: 10
      retry: 1
      interval: 1
      stopOnFailure: false
    httpProbe/inputs:
      url: http://frontend/cart
      method:
        get:
          criteria: ==
          responseCode: "200"
      responseTimeout: 15
```

Now, take a look at **Fault Weights**. 
* In the above sample workflow manifest, you will see that the default weight for the fault is set to `10`, which is used to determine the resilience score for the experiment run. 

## Run a chaos experiment

You can use the `RunChaosExperiment` API to run a chaos experiment that is created using the `CreateChaosWorkFlow` API.

GraphQL query: `RunChaosExperiment`
```
mutation RunChaosExperiment(
  $workflowID: String!,
  $identifiers: IdentifiersRequest!
) {
  runChaosExperiment(
    workflowID: $workflowID,
    identifiers: $identifiers
  ) {
    notifyID
  }
}
```

GraphQL variables: `RunChaosExperiment`
```
{
  "workflowID": "{{workflow-id-from-createChaosWorkflow-call}}",
  "identifiers": {
    "orgIdentifier": "{{org_id}}", 
    "accountIdentifier": "{{account_id}}",
    "projectIdentifier": "{{project_id}}"
  }
}
```
**Note:** The value of `workflowID` should be updated with the value retrieved using the `CreateChaosWorkFlow` API call.

A sample response: `RunChaosExperiment`
```
{
  "data": {
    "runChaosExperiment": {
      "notifyID": "abc123"
    }
  }
}
```
**Note:** Copy the value of the `notifyID` field.

## Observe chaos execution on the user interface

You can observe the experiment added to the list of chaos experiments. It would show `Running` status. Choose **Current Execution** to view the detailed execution.

![Experiment Executing](./static/first-chaos/experiment-executing.png)

When the fault is being executed, you can observe the detailed view and the logs of the experiment.

![Detailed Chaos Execution](./static/first-chaos/detailed-chaos-execution.png)

You can also see the status of the cart deployment pod. When you execute the below command, it displays all the pods in running state. It indicates that pod delete has deleted the cart pod, and replaced it with a new one, whose container is being created.

```

Consequently, if you try to access the frontend cart page, it throws an error that indicates that the application is unreachable.
![Webpage Unavailable](./static/first-chaos/webpage-unavailable.png)

You can validate this behavior using the application metrics dashboard. The probe success percentage for the application availability (200 response code) would steeply decrease along with the 99th percentile (green line), queries per second (QPS) and access duration. Also, the mean QPS (yellow line) steeply increases. This is because no pod is available to serve the query requests.

## Observe chaos execution using an API

You can use the `ListWorkflowRun` API to observe the current status of your experiment.

GraphQL query: `ListWorkflowRun`
```
query ListWorkflowRun(
  $identifiers: IdentifiersRequest!,
  $request: ListWorkflowRunRequest!
) {
  listWorkflowRun(
    identifiers: $identifiers,
    request: $request
  ) {
    totalNoOfWorkflowRuns
    workflowRuns {
      identifiers {
          orgIdentifier
          projectIdentifier
          accountIdentifier
      }
      workflowRunID
      workflowID
      weightages {
        experimentName
        weightage
      }
      updatedAt
      createdAt
      infra {
        infraID
        infraNamespace
        infraScope
        isActive
        isInfraConfirmed
      }
      workflowName
      workflowManifest
      phase
      resiliencyScore
      experimentsPassed
      experimentsFailed
      experimentsAwaited
      experimentsStopped
      experimentsNa
      totalExperiments
      executionData
      isRemoved
      updatedBy {
        userID
        username
      }
      createdBy {
        username
        userID
      }
    }
  }
}
```

GraphQL variables: `ListWorkflowRun`
```
{
  "identifiers": {
    "orgIdentifier": "{{org_id}}", 
    "accountIdentifier": "{{account_id}}",
    "projectIdentifier": "{{project_id}}"
  },
  "request": {
      "notifyIDs": ["{{comma-separated-notifyIDs-from-runChaosExperiment-api-call}}"]
  }
}
```
**Note:** The value for `notifyIDs` field was retrieved in the `RunChaosExperiment` API call.

A sample response: `ListWorkflowRun`
```
{
  "data": {
    "listWorkflowRun": {
      "totalNoOfWorkflowRuns": 987,
      "workflowRuns": [WorkflowRun]
    }
  }
}
```
All the workflow runs would be listed under field `workflowRuns` with all the required details and current status.
For instance, a field named `phase` would tell if a particular workflow is still `running/completed`.

## Evaluate the experiment run

When the experiment completes execution, you will see a resiliency score of 0%. You will also notice that the pod delete fault step failed. Before analyzing the expriment results, you can check that the application has come back to normal state, and is accessible. You can validate this from the Grafana dashboard where you can see visuals that indicate that chaos duration is complete. 

![App Metrics Normalizing](./static/first-chaos/app-metrics-normalizing.png)

You can see the chaos result which indicates that the experiment **Failed**, and the probe success percentage is 0%. This happened because the `http-cart-service` probe failed, which is a consequence of the cart pod being unavaialble since you injected chaos (pod delete) into the microservice.

![Experiment Failed Probe](./static/first-chaos/experiment-failed-probe.png)

The failed step specifies "Probe execution result didn't met the passing criteria", which validates HTTP probe failure that you previously defined.

![Fail Step Result](./static/first-chaos/fail-step-result.png)

With that, you have successfully executed your first vhaos experiment using chaos APIs. 

For the probe checks and experiment to pass, increase the number of experiment pods to 2 so that one of the deployment pod survives the pod delete fault and keeps the application running.

To re-run the experiment, re-trigger the [RunChaosExperiment](#run-a-chaos-experiment) with the existing `workflow ID` and use the [ListWorkflowRun](#observing-chaos-execution-using-api) to observe the experiment execution.
