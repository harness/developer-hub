description: Create a basic service onboarding pipeline in Harness IDP

## Introduction

This tutorial is designed to help a platform engineer to get started with Harness IDP. We will create a basic service onboarding pipeline that uses a software template and provisions a application templated by cookiecutter for a developer. After you create the software template, developers can choose the template on the **Workflow** page and enter details such as a name for the application and the path to their Git repository. The service onboarding pipeline creates a new repository and adds a `catalog-info.yaml` to it and registers it back into your software catalog all using the new **Developer Portal** stage. 

Users (developers) must perform a sequence of tasks to create the application. First, they interact with a software template. A software template is a form that collects a user's requirements. After a user submits the form, IDP executes a Harness pipeline that onboards the new service. Usually the pipeline fetches a cookiecutter template code, creates a new repository, and interacts with third-party providers such as cloud providers, Jira, and Slack.


## Prerequisites

Before you begin this tutorial, make sure that you fulfil the following requirements:

- Enable Harness IDP for your account.
- Make sure you are assigned the [IDP-Admin Role](https://developer.harness.io/docs/internal-developer-portal/rbac/resources-roles#1-idp-admin). 
- Create a connector where you want to create the repository, make sure you keep the name same as used below `connectorRef: account.democonnector` where democonnector is the connector name and we are using **Github** in the following tutorial you can [change that](https://developer.harness.io/internal-developer-portal/flows/idp-stage#connector) and update the YAML below as well. 

## Create a pipeline

Begin by creating a pipeline for onboarding the service.

To create a **Developer Portal** stage, perform the following steps:

1. Go to **Admin** section under IDP, select **Projects**, and then select a project.

You can also create a new project for the service onboarding pipelines. Eventually, all the users in your account should have permissions to execute the pipelines in this project. For information about creating a project, go to [Create organizations and projects](/docs/platform/organizations-and-projects/create-an-organization/).

2.  Then select **Create a Pipeline**, add a name for the pipeline and select the type as **Inline**

![](./static/add-a-pipeline.png)

3. In **Pipeline Studio**, select **Add Stage**. In **Select Stage Type**, select **Developer Portal**.

![](./static/developer-portal.png)

4. In **Stage Name**, enter a name **self-service-flow** for the stage, and then click **Set Up Stage**.

5. Now go to the YAML view and from line number 7 `stages:` replace it with the following YAML (make sure you have used the same stage name as described above.)

```

The above YAML will create a service onbaording pipeline for you using IDP stage as [described in this docs](https://developer.harness.io/docs/internal-developer-portal/flows/idp-stage/#execution-steps). 

6. Now Save the pipeline. 

### Create a software template definition in IDP

Now that our pipeline is ready to execute when a project name and a GitHub repository name are provided, let's create the UI counterpart of it in IDP. This is powered by the [Backstage Software Template](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-templates/writing-templates). Create a `template.yaml` file anywhere in your Git repository. Usually, that would be the same place as your cookiecutter template.

  output:
    links:
      - title: Pipeline Details
        url: ${{ steps.trigger.output.PipelineUrl }}
```

Replace the `url` with the pipeline URL that you created.

![](./static/copy-pipeline-url.png)

This YAML code is governed by Backstage. You can change the name and description of the software template. The template has the following parts:

1. Input from the user
2. Execution of pipeline

![](./static/template-new-1.png)
![](./static/template-new-2.png)

Let's take a look at the inputs that the template expects from a developer. The inputs are written in the `spec.parameters` field. It has two parts, but you can combine them. The keys in `properties` are the unique IDs of fields (for example, `github_repo` and `project_name`). If you recall, they are the pipeline variables that we set as runtime inputs earlier. This is what we want the developer to enter when creating their new application.

The YAML definition includes fields such as cloud provider and database choice. They are for demonstration purposes only and are not used in this tutorial.

### Authenticate the request

Once you have written all the inputs that the template requires, you must add the following YAML snippet under `spec.parameters.properties`.

```yaml
token:
  title: Harness Token
  type: string
  ui:widget: password
  ui:field: HarnessAuthToken
```

Also the token input is used as a paremeter under `steps` as `apikey`

```yaml
  steps:
    - id: trigger
      name: ...
      action: trigger:harness-custom-pipeline
      input:
        url: ...
        inputset:
          key: value
          ...
        apikey: ${{ parameters.token }}
```

This is a custom component we created to authenticate the call to execute the pipeline on the basis of the logged-in user's credentials.

### Action to trigger the pipeline

:::info

The template actions currently supports only [IDP Stage](https://developer.harness.io/docs/internal-developer-portal/flows/idp-stage)[custom stage](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/pipelines/add-a-stage/#add-a-custom-stage) and codebase disabled [CI stage with Run step](https://developer.harness.io/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/run-ci-scripts/run-step-settings/#add-the-run-step), also all input, except for [pipeline input as variables](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/variables-and-expressions/harness-variables/#pipeline), must be of [fixed value](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/variables-and-expressions/runtime-inputs/#fixed-values).

:::

The `spec.steps` field contains only one action, and that is to trigger a Harness pipeline. Update the `url` and replace it with the URL of your service onboarding pipeline. Also, ensure that the `inputset` is correct and it contains all the runtime input variables that the pipeline needs.

### Register the template

Use the URL to the `template.yaml` created above and register it by using the same process for [registering a new software component](/docs/internal-developer-portal/get-started/register-a-new-software-component).

Now navigate to the **Create** page in IDP. You will see the newly created template appear. Try it out!

### Unregister/Delete Template

1. Navigate to the **Catalog** page, and select **Template** under Kind.

![](./static/catalog-navigation.png)

2. Select the Template Name you want to Unregister.
3. Now on the Template overview page, click on the 3 dots on top right corner and select **Unregister Entity**.

![](./static/unregister-entity.png)

4. Now on the Dialog box select **Unregister Location**.

![](./static/Unregister-location.png)

5. This will delete the Template.
