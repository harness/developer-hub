Harness provides governance using [Open Policy Agent (OPA)](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/), Policy Management, and Rego policies.

In this tutorial we will look into how you can create the policy and apply it to all Services in your Account. The policy is evaluated on Service-level based on the score fetched from scorecards and the conditions set by users, and applues on pipeline-event like On Save which occurs during Connector Creation and Updates. Go to [Harness Governance Quickstart](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/governance/policy-as-code/harness-governance-quickstart).

10. Now finish the step and an Policy Set would be created with Account Level Scope. 

## Conclusion

You have set-up a policy which can be used in your Deployment Pipeline.
