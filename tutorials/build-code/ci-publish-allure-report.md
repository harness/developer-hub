# Publish an Allure Report to the Artifacts tab 

This tutorial provides an example pipeline that builds a Java Maven application and generates an Allure Report that you can view in the Harness UI. 

:::note

Artifact tab publishing is supported in the Kubernetes infrastructure only.

:::

### Pipeline workflow 

This pipeline has five steps that do the following: 

1. Runs the Maven tests present in the project. 

2. Generates the Allure Report using the `allure-results` generated as part of step 1. The Allure tool is present in the `solutis/allure:2.9.0` Docker image used as part of the step.

3. Combines the Allure Report into a single HTML file.
   
   Viewing an Allure Report in a browser requires running a web server via the `allure open` command. But this won't allow viewing the report after the CI pipeline is complete.

   Use the [allure-combine](https://pypi.org/project/allure-combine/) tool to convert the Allure Report into a single HTML file. Running `allure-combine .` inside `allure-report` generates the `complete.html` file. This step uses the  `shubham149/allure-combine:latest` Docker image with the `allure-combine` tool present in it.

4. Publishes the report to a  Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket.
 
5. Uses static web hosting in GCS to display the Allure Report on the **Artifacts** tab. 
   
   The `plugins/artifact-metadata-publisher` plugin adds the input URLs to the **Artifacts** tab in the Harness UI.


### Pipeline requirements

To run this pipeline in your project, do the following.

1. Create a file secret with your GCP authorization credentials. Do the following:

  a. [Create a service account key](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys#creating) as described in the Google Cloud documentation. 

  b. Create a [Harness secret](/docs/platform/security/add-file-secrets) for your key. 

1. Create the following connectors if you don't have them:

   -  [GitHub Connector](/docs/platform/connectors/add-a-git-hub-connector)
   - [GCP Connector](/docs/platform/connectors/connect-to-google-cloud-platform-gcp) 
      Use the file secret you just created for the GCP credentials.
   - [Docker Hub Connector](/docs/platform/connectors/ref-cloud-providers/docker-registry-connector-settings-reference)  
      You can choose to download Harness images from the [Harness Image Registry](/docs/platform/connectors/connect-to-harness-container-image-registry-using-docker-connector) instead of Docker Hub.

2.  Create a [publicly available bucket in GCS](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/making-data-public#objects) to store the report. 

3.  Update the report URL with your GCS bucket name. See `YOUR_GCS_BUCKET_NAME` in steps 4 and 5 in the YAML pipeline below.
