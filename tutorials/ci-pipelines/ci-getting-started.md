## Harness CI

Harness CI is a modern Continuous Integration platform that empowers busy teams to automate their build, test, and release workflows using a powerful, cloud-native pipeline engine.

Developers are frustrated with the time it takes to ship code and often end up wasting their precious time waiting for the builds to complete.

With Harness CI, you can build faster and be more productive. Harness CI's pricing is competitive to other leading CI providers, which gives you more cost savings with the speed benefit.

Harness CI is built on Drone. Over the last 10 years, we focused on solving developers' frustration with the time it took to ship code with existing CI tools. Harness CI's vision is to create a CI tool that is fast, simple, open, and secure.

### Build pipelines four times faster than GitHub Actions

Harness CI is four times faster due to optimized defaults with hosted builds, so you don't have to set up and manage infrastructure or optimize caching and other technologies to improve build times.

Cache Intelligence dramatically reduces pipeline execution time by automatically caching well-known directories for Java, Node package managers, and more.

[Test Intelligence](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/run-tests/test-intelligence/set-up-test-intelligence) can improve build cycles by up to 90% with machine learning (ML) that runs only the necessary tests relevant to code changes. Once tests are identified, you can speed up test cycles even more by splitting and running tests concurrently.

In the following demo video, Harness goes head-to-head with GitHub Actions. You can follow [these instructions](https://github.com/harness-community/kafka/blob/trunk/.harness/README.md) to reproduce the results and try it for yourself.

### Get started fast

Developer productivity is a core pillar for Harness. We didn't want to build a CI tool that was fast but complex to use. You can get started quickly with any language in Harness CI, with out-of-the-box starter templates and code-first development. You can connect to any Source Code Management (SCM) system, build any apps for any language or platform, and host it anywhere.

### Create and share open source plugins

Harness uses containers to drop preâ€‘configured steps into your pipeline. Choose from thousands of existing [plugins](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/use-drone-plugins/explore-ci-plugins), or [create your own](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/use-drone-plugins/custom_plugins) and run it on a container or the host virtual machine.

## Create a pipeline for your favorite language

With Harness CI, you can build, test, and deploy applications in Node.js, Python, Java, Ruby, PHP, Go, Rust, C# (.NET Core), and more. You can use VMs or containers for Linux, Windows, and Mac operating systems.

   For new accounts, the Get Started wizard creates a codebase connector for you. If your account already has a connector, the Get Started wizard automatically selects the existing connector. You can [create codebase connectors](/docs/platform/connectors/code-repositories/connect-to-code-repo) by navigating to **Projects** and then **Connectors**.

5. When asked to select a repository, select the Go sample repository that you forked earlier, and then select **Configure Pipeline**.
6. Select **Generate my Pipeline configuration**, enter a branch name (such as `main`), and then select **Create Pipeline**.
7. Switch to the **YAML** editor, and select **Edit YAML**.
8. Replace the `echo` step with the following, and then save the pipeline.

```yaml
- step:
    type: Run

## Build and test Apache Kafka four times faster on Harness CI

You can build even faster with Harness CI - Learn how you can build and test Apache Kafka four times faster on Harness CI:

- Read the performance data here: [https://harness.io/blog/fastest-ci-tool](https://harness.io/blog/fastest-ci-tool)
- Follow the instructions for [this sample](https://github.com/harness-community/kafka/blob/trunk/.harness/README.md) to reproduce the results and see for yourself.

<figure>

![Performance comparisons for Harness, GitHub Actions, and CI Vendor 2.](static/ci-tutorial-fast/harness_ci_stats.png)

<figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

Harness CI gives you speed benefits at a much lower cost. We compared the cost of running a single build for Apache Kafka, RocketMQ, and Zookeeper.

- GitHub Actions costs $0.008 per build minute.
- CI Vendor 2 costs $0.0120 per build minute.
- Harness CI is competitively priced, at $0.008 per build minute, relative to GitHub Actions, and priced lower than CI Vendor 2.

With the advantage of being four times faster, your builds will take less time. Combined with the competitive pricing of $0.008 per build minute, your total cost could be 1/4th the cost of the other CI competitors. Learn more about our test methodology [here](https://harness.io/blog/fastest-ci-tool).
