## Harness CI

Harness CI is a modern Continuous Integration platform that empowers busy teams to automate their build, test, and release workflows using a powerful, cloud-native pipeline engine.

![CI Fast](static/ci-tutorial-fast/cifast.png)

Developers are frustrated with the time it takes to ship code and often end up wasting their precious time waiting for the builds to complete.

With Harness CI, you can build faster and be more productive. Harness CI's pricing is competitive to other leading CI providers, which gives you more cost savings with the speed benefit.
Harness CI is built on Drone, and over the last 10 years we have been focusing on solving the developer's frustration with the time it took to ship code with existing CI tools. Harness CI's vision is to create a CI tool that is fast, simple, open, and secure.

### Build pipelines 4 times faster than GitHub Actions

Harness CI is 4 times faster due to optimized defaults with hosted builds so you don't have to set up and manage infrastructure or optimize caching and other technologies to improve build times. Cache Intelligence dramatically reduces pipeline execution time by automatically caching well-known directories for Java, Node package managers, and more. Test Intelligence
can improve build cycles by up to 90% with machine learning (ML) that runs only the necessary tests relevant to code changes. Once tests are identified, speed up test cycles even more by splitting and running tests concurrently.

In this demo, Harness goes head-to-head with GitHub Actions. You can follow [these instructions](https://github.com/harness-community/kafka/blob/trunk/.harness/README.md) to reproduce the results and see for yourself.

### Get started in 5 easy steps

Developer productivity is a core pillar for Harness. We didn't want to build a CI tool that was fast and complex to use. You can get started quickly with any language in Harness CI, with out-of-the-box starter templates and code-first development. You can connect to any Source Code Management (SCM) system, build any apps for any language or platform, and host it anywhere.

### Create and share open source plugins

Harness uses containers to drop pre‑configured steps into your pipeline. Choose from thousands of existing plugins, or create your own and run it on a container or the host virtual machine.

## Create a pipeline for your favorite language

Build, test, and deploy applications in Node.js, Python, Java, Ruby, PHP, Go, Rust, .NET, and more. Use VMs or containers for Linux, Windows, and Mac operating systems.

## Build and test Apache Kafka 4 times faster on Harness CI

Congratulations on building your first pipeline. You can build even faster with Harness CI.
Learn how you can build and test Apache Kafka four times faster on Harness CI.
Read more about the performance data here [https://harness.io/blog/fastest-ci-tool](https://harness.io/blog/fastest-ci-tool) and follow the instructions of [this sample](https://github.com/harness-community/kafka/blob/trunk/.harness/README.md) to reproduce the results and see for yourself.

![HarnessCI Performance Chart ](static/ci-tutorial-fast/harness_ci_stats.png)

Harness CI gives you speed benefits at a much lower cost. We compared the cost of running a single build for Apache Kafka, RocketMQ and Zookeeper. GitHub Actions costs $0.008 per build minute, and CI Vendor 2 costs $0.0120 per build minute. Harness CI is competitively priced ($0.008 per build minute) relative to GitHub Actions and priced lower than CI Vendor 2. With the four times speed benefits, your builds will take less time and with the competitive pricing of $0.008 per build minute, your total cost could be 1/4th the cost of the other CI competitors.
