```

This tutorial will get you started with Harness Continuous Delivery (CD). We will guide you through deploying new Google Cloud Functions to Google Cloud using a Harness CD pipeline. 

:::info

[Sign up today to unleash the potential of intelligent Harness CD](https://app.harness.io/auth/#/signup/?module=cd&utm_source=website&utm_medium=harness-developer-hub&utm_campaign=cd-plg&utm_content=tutorials-cd-serverless-gcp-function).

:::

Harness CD pipelines help you to orchestrate and automate your Google Cloud Function deployments and push updated functions to Google Cloud. 

Pipelines allow extensive control over how you want to progress functions through various dev/test/stage/prod environments while running a variety of scans and tests to ensure your quality and stability standards.

## Before you begin

Verify that you have the following:

1. **Obtain GitHub personal access token with the repo scope**. See the GitHub documentation on [creating a personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line).
2. **A Kubernetes cluster**. Use your own Kubernetes cluster or we recommend using [K3D](https://k3d.io/v5.5.1/) for installing a Harness delegate.
    - Check [Delegate system requirements](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/Delegates/delegate-concepts/delegate-requirements).
3. **Install the [Docker](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)** in order to install the Docker delegate.
4. **Fork the [harnessed-example-apps](https://github.com/harness-community/harnesscd-example-apps/fork)** repository through the GitHub website.
    - For details on Forking a GitHub repository, go to [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository) for more information on forking a GitHub repository.
5. ** Google Cloud Function and Google Cloud Storage permissions**. Harness supports Google Cloud Functions **1st gen** and **2nd gen**. There are minor differences in the permissions required by each generation. For a detailed breakdown, go to [Access control with IAM from Google](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/concepts/iam).


## Google Cloud Function Support 

Cloud Functions offers two product versions: Cloud Functions **1st gen**, the original version, and Cloud Functions **2nd gen**, a new version built on Cloud Run and Eventarc to provide an enhanced feature set. Harness supports deploying Google Functions 1st gen and 2nd gen.

To get more information on Google Functions 1st gen and 2nd gen, go to [Cloud Functions version comparison](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/concepts/version-comparison).

We suggest opting for Cloud Functions **2nd gen** whenever feasible for new functions, as it offers a range of additional features. For more information, go to [New in Cloud Functions(2nd Gen)](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/concepts/version-comparison#new-in-2nd-gen).


## Cloud Functions Limitations
- For Google Cloud Functions 2nd gen, Harness does not support [Google Cloud Source Repository](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/deploy#from-source-repo) at this time. Only Google Cloud Storage is supported.
- For Google Cloud Functions 1st gen, Harness supports both Google Cloud Storage and Google Cloud Source.

## Steps to perform on Google Cloud 

- Make sure your Google Cloud account credentials have the required permissions for **Google Cloud Function** and **Google Cloud Storage**, as mentioned above.
- Download the **hello_world.zip** for 1st gen and **helloHttp.zip** for 2nd gen files from [GitHub](https://github.com/harness-community/harnesscd-example-apps/tree/master/google_cloud_function).
- Log into the Google Cloud console and create a Google Cloud Storage bucket. For details, go to [Create a new bucket](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/creating-buckets).
- Once the bucket is created, select **UPLOAD FILES** and upload the file **hello_world.zip** for 1st gen or **helloHttp.zip** for 2nd gen.

```

<details open>
<summary>What are Blue Green deployments?</summary>

Blue Green deployments involve running two identical environments (stage and prod) simultaneously with different service versions. QA and UAT are performed on a **new** service version in the stage environment first. Next, traffic is shifted from the prod environment to stage, and the previous service/function version running on prod is scaled down. Blue Green deployments are also referred to as red/black deployment by some vendors. For more information, go to [When to use Blue Green deployments](https://developer.harness.io/docs/continuous-delivery/manage-deployments/deployment-concepts#when-to-use-blue-green-deployments).
