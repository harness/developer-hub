The Harness delegate is a service that runs in your local network or VPC to establish connections between the Harness Manager and various providers such as artifacts registries, cloud platforms, etc. The delegate is installed in the target infrastructure, for example, a Kubernetes cluster, and performs operations including deployment and integration. Learn more about the delegate in the [Delegate Overview](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/delegates/delegate-concepts/delegate-overview/).

</details>

1. In **PROJECT SETUP**, select **Delegates**, and then Select **Delegates** on the top right corner of the UI.
   - Select **New Delegate**.
     For this tutorial, let's explore how to install the delegate using Helm.
   - In **Select where you want to install your Delegate**, select **Kubernetes**.
   - In **Install your Delegate**, select **Helm Chart**.
   - Add the Harness Helm Chart repository to your local helm registry using the following commands:
   
     ```bash
     helm repo add harness-delegate https://app.harness.io/storage/harness-download/delegate-helm-chart/
     ```
     ```bash
     helm repo update harness-delegate
     ```
     
    - Copy the following command from the Delegate Installation wizard.
    
      `DELEGATE_TOKEN`,`ACCOUNT_ID` and `MANAGER_ENDPOINT` are auto-populated values that you can obtain from the Delegate Installation wizard. 
    
      ```bash
      helm upgrade -i helm-delegate --namespace harness-delegate-ng --create-namespace \
      harness-delegate/harness-delegate-ng \
      --set delegateName=helm-delegate \
      --set accountId=ACCOUNT_ID \
