_**This tutorial is a continuation of the Kubernetes Manifest tutorial. In the previous tutorial, we guided you through creating a sample pipeline using the Guestbook sample app. In this tutorial, we'll walk you through deploying your own microservice app with the Harness CD pipeline.**_

**Sock Shop**, developed by Weaveworks, serves as a polyglot architectural pattern to showcase microservices-based deployments. This application suite integrates a range of technologies, such as SpringBoot, Go, REDIS, MYSQL, MongoDB, among others. We've chosen the Sock Shop as our demonstration app for the deployment process in Harness.

You can use the same steps to integrate and deploy your own microservice app.

### Delegate

4. You have the option to use the same delegate that you deployed during the Manifest tutorial or to deploy a new delegate by following the steps below. However, remember to use a newly created delegate identifier when creating connectors.

- Log in to the [Harness UI](https://app.harness.io/). In **Project Setup**, select **Delegates**.
    - Select **Delegates**.
        - Select **Install delegate**. For this tutorial, let's explore how to install the delegate using Helm.
        - Add the Harness Helm chart repo to your local Helm registry.  

        ```bash
        helm repo add harness-delegate https://app.harness.io/storage/harness-download/delegate-helm-chart/
        ```  

        ```bash
        helm repo update harness-delegate
        ```
        -  In the command provided, `ACCOUNT_ID`, `MANAGER_ENDPOINT`, and `DELEGATE_TOKEN` are auto-populated values that you can obtain from the delegate Installation wizard.  

            ```bash
            helm upgrade -i helm-delegate --namespace harness-delegate-ng --create-namespace \
            harness-delegate/harness-delegate-ng \
             --set delegateName=helm-delegate \
             --set accountId=ACCOUNT_ID \
             --set managerEndpoint=MANAGER_ENDPOINT \
             --set delegateDockerImage=harness/delegate:23.03.78904 \
             --set replicas=1 --set upgrader.enabled=false \
             --set delegateToken=DELEGATE_TOKEN
            ```
    - Verify that the delegate is installed successfully and can connect to the Harness Manager.
    - You can also follow the [Install Harness delegate on Kubernetes or Docker](/tutorials/platform/install-delegate/) tutorial to install the delegate using the Terraform Helm Provider or Kubernetes manifest.

:::caution

If you plan to use your own Project, Organization, and custom names for Harness resources, please update the resource YAMLs accordingly with these details.

:::

#### Secrets

5. If you intend to use a private Git repository that hosts your manifest files, create a Harness secret containing the Git personal access token (PAT) with name `ownappgitpat`. Subsequently, create a new Git connector using this secret.
    - Under **Project Setup**, select **Secrets**.
        - Select **New Secret**, and then select **Text**.
        - Enter the secret name `ownappgitpat`.
        - For the secret value, paste the GitHub personal access token you saved earlier.
        - Select **Save**.

#### Connectors

6. Replace **url** with your GitHub Repo URL that hosts your manifest files in the `github-connector.yaml`.

7. Verify that the `projectIdentifier` and `orgIdentifier` is correct and the `tokenRef` value matches the Git PAT secret you created in the previous step.

8. Now create the **GitHub connector** using the following CLI command:
    ```
    harness connector --file github-connector.yml apply --git-user <YOUR GITHUB USERNAME>
    ```
9. Utilize the same delegate that you deployed as part of the Manifest tutorial or use the newly created delegate identifier to create the **Kubernetes connector** using the following CLI command:
    
    ```
    harness connector --file kubernetes-connector.yml apply --delegate-name DELEGATE_IDENTIFIER
    ```

### Environment
    
10. Check the `environment.yml` file and use the following `harness` CLI Command to create **Environments** in your Harness project:

    ```
    harness environment --file environment.yml apply
    ```

11. In the environment you created above, add **Infrastructure Definition** using below `infrastructure-definition.yml`. Then, invoke the CLI command to create the entity:

    ```
    harness infrastructure --file infrastructure-definition.yml apply 
    ```

### Services


12. Verify the `service.yml` and invoke the following CLI command to create **Services** in your Harness Project. 

    ```
    harness service -file service.yml apply
    ```

         ```bash
         kubectl get pods -n default
         ```

     - Sock Shop is accessible via the master and any of the node urls on port `30001`.

### Automate deployments

#### Using Triggers

With [Pipeline Triggers](/docs/category/triggers), you can start automating your deployments based on events happening in an external system. This system could be a Source Repository, an Artifact Repository, or a third party system. Any Developer with Pipeline Create and Edit permissions can configure a trigger in Harness. 

Follow the [Pipeline Triggers](/tutorials/cd-pipelines/trigger) tutorial to see triggers in action.

#### Using API

You can also utilize the [Harness API](/docs/category/api) to manage resources, view, create/edit, or delete them.

Refer to the [Get started with Harness API](/docs/platform/automation/api/api-quickstart) guide to learn how to use the API for automation.

### Congratulations!🎉

You've just learned how to use Harness CD to deploy your own application.
