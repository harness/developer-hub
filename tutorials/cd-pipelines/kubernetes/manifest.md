Harness CD pipelines allow you to orchestrate and automate your deployment workflows, and push updated application images to your target Kubernetes cluster. Pipelines allow extensive control over how you want to progress artifacts through various dev / test / stage / prod clusters, while running a variety of scans & tests to ensure quality and stability standards you and team may have defined.
## Before you begin

Verify that you have the following:

1. **Obtain GitHub personal access token with the repo scope**. See the GitHub documentation on [creating a personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line).
2. **A Kubernetes cluster**. Use your own Kubernetes cluster or we recommend using [K3D](https://k3d.io/v5.5.1/) for installing Harness Delegates and deploying a sample application in a local development environment.
    - Check [Delegate system requirements](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/Delegates/delegate-concepts/delegate-requirements).
3. **Install the [Helm CLI](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)** in order to install the Harness Helm delegate.
4. **Fork the [harnessed-example-apps](https://github.com/harness-community/harnesscd-example-apps/fork)** repository through the GitHub website.
    - For details on Forking a GitHub repository, go to [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository) for more information on forking a GitHub repository.

## Getting Started with Harness CD

### Delegate

<details open>
<summary>What is the Harness delegate?</summary>

The Harness delegate is a service that runs in your local network or VPC to establish connections between the Harness Manager and various providers such as artifacts registries, cloud platforms, etc. The delegate is installed in the target infrastructure, for example, a Kubernetes cluster, and performs operations including deployment and integration. Learn more about the delegate in the [Delegate Overview](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/delegates/delegate-concepts/delegate-overview/).

</details>

3. Under **Project Setup**, select **Delegates**.
    - Select **Tokens**.
        - Select **New Token**.
        - Name the token `delegate_token`.
        - Select **Apply**.
        - Copy the token value by selecting on the copy icon and store it somewhere.
        - Select **Close**.
    - Select **Delegates**.
        - Select **New Delegate**.
          
          For this tutorial, let's explore how to install a delegate using Helm.

        - Add the Harness Helm chart repo to your local helm registry using the following commands.
        
        ```bash
        helm repo add harness-delegate https://app.harness.io/storage/harness-download/delegate-helm-chart/
        ```

        - Update the repo:

        ```bash
        helm repo update harness-delegate
        ```

        -  In the command provided, `ACCOUNT_ID` and `MANAGER_ENDPOINT` are auto-populated values that you can obtain from the delegate installation wizard.
        -  Replace **DELEGATE_TOKEN** in the command with the token that was copied earlier and proceed with delegate installation.

         
        ```bash
        helm upgrade -i helm-delegate --namespace harness-delegate-ng --create-namespace \
        harness-delegate/harness-delegate-ng \
         --set delegateName=helm-delegate \
         --set accountId=ACCOUNT_ID \
         --set managerEndpoint=MANAGER_ENDPOINT \
         --set delegateDockerImage=harness/delegate:23.03.78904 \
         --set replicas=1 --set upgrader.enabled=false \
         --set delegateToken=DELEGATE_TOKEN
        ```
        - Select **Verify** to verify that the delegate is installed successfully and can connect to the Harness Manager.

:::note

You can also follow the [Install Harness Delegate on Kubernetes or Docker](https://developer.harness.io/tutorials/platform/install-delegate/) tutorial to install the delegate using the Harness Terraform Provider or a Kubernetes manifest.

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Canary">
```

<details open>
<summary>What are Canary deployments?</summary>

A canary deployment updates nodes in a single environment gradually, allowing you to use gates between increments. Canary deployments allow incremental updates and ensure a controlled rollout process. For more information, go to [When to use Canary deployments](https://developer.harness.io/docs/continuous-delivery/manage-deployments/deployment-concepts#when-to-use-canary-deployments).

</details>

- Copy the contents of [6-canary-deployment.yml](https://github.com/harness-community/harnesscd-example-apps/blob/master/guestbook/harnesscd-pipeline/6-canary-deployment.yml).

- In your Harness pipeline YAML editor, paste the YAML.

- Select **Save**.
   
   You can switch to the **Visual** editor and confirm the pipeline stage and execution steps as shown below.

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Blue Green">
```

<details open>
<summary>What are Blue Green deployments?</summary>

Blue Green deployments involve running two identical environments (stage and prod) simultaneously with different service versions. QA and UAT are performed on a **new** service version in the stage environment first. Next, traffic is shifted from the prod environment to stage, and the previous service version running on prod is scaled down. Blue Green deployments are also referred to as red/black deployment by some vendors. For more information, go to [When to use Blue Green deployments](https://developer.harness.io/docs/continuous-delivery/manage-deployments/deployment-concepts#when-to-use-blue-green-deployments).

</details>


- Copy the contents of [6-bluegreen-deployment.yml](https://github.com/harness-community/harnesscd-example-apps/blob/master/guestbook/harnesscd-pipeline/6-bluegreen-deployment.yml).

- In your Harness pipeline YAML editor, paste the YAML.

- Select **Save**.
   
   You can switch to the **Visual** pipeline editor and confirm the pipeline stage and execution steps as shown below.

   <docimage path={require('../static/k8s-manifest-tutorial/bluegreen.png')} width="60%" height="60%" title="Click to view full size image" />


```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Rolling">
```

<details open>
<summary>What are Rolling deployments?</summary>

Rolling deployments incrementally add nodes in a single environment with a new service version, either one-by-one or in batches defined by a window size. Rolling deployments allow a controlled and gradual update process for the new service version. For more information, go to [When to use rolling deployments](https://developer.harness.io/docs/continuous-delivery/manage-deployments/deployment-concepts#when-to-use-rolling-deployments).

</details>



- Copy the contents of [6-rolling-deployment.yml](https://github.com/harness-community/harnesscd-example-apps/blob/master/guestbook/harnesscd-pipeline/6-rolling-deployment.yml).

- In your Harness pipeline YAML editor, paste the YAML.

- Select **Save**.
   
   You can switch to the **Visual** pipeline editor and confirm the pipeline stage and execution steps as shown below.

   <docimage path={require('../static/k8s-manifest-tutorial/rolling.png')} width="60%" height="60%" title="Click to view full size image" />

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

Finally, it's time to execute your pipeline. 

10.  Select **Run**, and then select **Run Pipeline** to initiate the deployment.
  - Observe the execution logs as Harness deploys the workload and checks for steady state.
  - After a successful execution, you can check the deployment on your Kubernetes cluster using the following command:
        
    ```bash
    kubectl get pods -n default
    ```

  - To access the Guestbook application deployed by the Harness pipeline, port forward the service and access it at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
        
    ```bash
    kubectl port-forward svc/guestbook-ui 8080:80
    ```
