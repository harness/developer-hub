- For the JVM argument, use the parameter -Dharness.etagent.stats.interval=




#### How do I increase the amount of information collected for each snapshot by the CET agent?

There are two ways one can increase the cart factor to increase the amount of data collected by the CET agent (valid values are between 0.1-4):
- For the environment variable, use the parameter ET_CART_FACTOR=
- For the JVM argument, use the parameter -Dharness.etagent.cart.factor=




#### How does the cart factor impact the amount of information gathered for each snapshot by the CET agent?

The amount of data collected during snapshot is determined by an internal algorithm called the cart.

The valid values vary between: 0.1-4 (including decimals to one decimal place). A cart factor of 2 records twice as much as a normal hit. A cart factor of 0.5 records half as much as a normal hit.
Note that larger snapshots may result in larger overhead. A larger cart factor is trading more overhead for more information. This does not affect the number of snapshots taken or levels deep into the heap.




#### How do I configure the CET agent to capture snapshot data of a transaction which has introduced slowness related to automatic timers?

There are two ways one can configure the CET agent to capture snapshot data of the transaction that has introduced slowness:
- For the environment variable, use the parameter ET_PARALLAX
- For the JVM argument, use the parameter -Dharness.etagent.parallax




#### How does the CET agent automatically detect slowdowns and identify possible root causes for each one of the exceptions that are found?

The CET micro-agent periodically collects statistics of each transaction, once our micro-agent encounters an entry point. The Harness backend service collects this data, calculates the threshold for this entry point (based on a standard deviation calculation from the methodâ€™s average running time) and relay it back to the micro-agent.

When this timer feature is enabled, the micro-agent will take a snapshot of the slowdown event once the transaction running time is taking longer than the calculated threshold. The agent will do so while looking for the most significant methods using CET heuristics search algorithm, so we can get a deeper stack trace, with more relevant data for you to help you analyze where the most running time was spent.

In order to get the proper snapshot data of the transaction which has introduced the slowness, you need to enable the following runtime flag when you run the agent with your application:
-Dharness.etagent.parallax




#### Why does my CET agent not work after upgrading my JRE from Java 8 to Java 11?

When attaching a CET agent to a JVM that is running Java 10, 11, 16, or 17, ensure to use the following Java parameters:
Turn off Class Sharing: This can be done using the following flags:
 for IBM Java
  -Xshareclasses:none
 for HotSpot
  -Xshare:off -XX:-UseTypeSpeculation

Increase ReservedCodeCache to at least 512mb by adding the following flag:
-XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize=512m

The Agent should appear last in the VM arguments list before specifying the main class or jar.

When adding/removing 3rd party packages, the Agent should be restarted.




#### How do I configure which logging framework from the CET default list will be instrumented?

There are two ways one can setup the CET agent to instrument specific logging frameworks if all frameworks are not to be used:

- For the JVM argument, use the parameter -Dharness.etagent.optimize.methods=

Example: -Dharness.etagent.optimize.methods=com.company.Class1:method1|com.company.Class2:method2




#### What is the significance of using the ET_OPTIMIZE_METHODS parameter with the CET agent?

ET_OPTIMIZE_METHODS excludes a method during code throttling. In some cases, 3rd-party code is responsible for a significant part of the Micro-Agentâ€™s overhead. Excluding it specifically from exception handling significantly reduces overhead.

NOTE: This action does not ignore the method completely. It is efficient only where the CET Micro-Agent is creating a significant overhead.

Example: -Dharness.etagent.optimize.methods=com.company.Class1:method1|com.company.Class2:method2

ET_OPTIMIZE_PACKAGES excludes a package during code throttling. 3rd-party code potentially increases overhead on the Micro-Agent. Excluding it specifically from exception handling significantly reduces overhead.

NOTE: This action does not ignore the package completely. It is efficient only where the OverOps Micro-Agent is creating a significant overhead.

Example: -Dharness.etagent.optimize.packages=com.company.package1|com.company.package2




#### Is there a way to disable the CET agent from collecting details of the JVM during startup?

There are two ways to disable the CET agent from collecting details of the JVM during start up:
- For the environment variable, use the parameter ET_DISABLE_EXCEPTION_HANDLING_TIME=
- For the JVM argument, use the parameter -Dharness.disable.exception.handling.time=

Example: -Dharness.disable.exception.handling.time=10m




#### How exactly does the ET_DISABLE_EXCEPTION_HANDLING_TIME parameter help with the startup of the JVM?

Using the ET_DISABLE_EXCEPTION_HANDLING_TIME parameter, the CET agent configures a time frame during JVM startup in which the Micro-Agent does not collect any information (snapshots or statistics) or perform any instrumentation. Callback is triggered, but the CET Micro-Agent will return immediately on every call. This increases boot times slowed down by the CET Micro-Agent.

Example: -Dharness.disable.exception.handling.time=10m




#### How can the CET agent prevent from instrumenting a method being called multiple times in a stack?

There are two ways to disable the CET agent from collecting details of the JVM during start up:
- For the environment variable, use the parameter ET_NO_RECURSIVE_CONTEXT
- For the JVM argument, use the parameter -Dharness.no.recursive.context




#### What is the significance of using the ET_NO_RECURSIVE_CONTEXT parameter with the CET agent?

The CET Micro-Agent uses the ET_NO_RECURSIVE_CONTEXT parameter to disable instrumention of methods being called multiple times per call stack.  In certain applications, some methods are repeatedly called in the same call stack. This causes significant CPU overhead and using this flag prevents this.




#### How can the CET agent prevent from collecting variable data from snapshots?

There are two ways to exclude the CET agent from collecting variable data from snapshots:
- For the environment variable, use the parameter ET_NO_LOCALS
- For the JVM argument, use the parameter -Dharness.no.locals




#### What is the significance of using the ET_NO_LOCALS parameter within the CET agent?

The ET_NO_LOCALS parameter excludes the variable state from the snapshots to reduce overhead for diagnostics purposes. This flag turns off the CET Micro-Agentâ€™s JVMTI capability to extract local variable data during snapshot encoding causing significant overhead.




#### Is there a way to prevent the CET agent from displaying exceptions?

There are two ways to prevent the CET agent from displaying exceptions:
- For the environment variable, use the parameter ET_NO_EX_CALLBACK
- For the JVM argument, use the parameter -Dharness.no.ex.callback




#### When would it be beneficial to use the ET_NO_EX_CALLBACK parameter for the CET agent?

Using the ET_NO_EX_CALLBACK parameter for the CET agent turns off its registration to the JVMTI exception callback, which causes severe overhead in the JVM. When set, no exceptions are displayed. This is intended for diagnostics purposes only.




#### Is there a way to turn off the CET agent's callback capability on exceptions?

There are two ways to turn off the CET agent's callback capability on exceptions:
- For the environment variable, use the parameter ET_NO_EX
- For the JVM argument, use the parameter -Dharness.no.ex




#### When would it be beneficial to use the ET_NO_EX parameter for the CET agent?

Using the ET_NO_EX parameter for the CET agent turns off its JVMTI exception callback capability that causes severe overhead in the JVM. When set, callback is triggered but returned immediately. This is intended for diagnostics purposes only.

Note: Disabling this flag may cause inaccurate â€˜catch frameâ€™ and â€˜catch lineâ€™ designation.




#### Is there a way to prevent the CET agent from collecting less data within snapshots?

There are two ways to prevent the CET agent from collecting less data within snapshots:
- For the environment variable, use the parameter ET_NO_RICH_HITS
- For the JVM argument, use the parameter -Dharness.no.rich.hits




#### What is the significance of utilizing the ET_NO_RICH_HITS parameter for the CET agent?

Rich hits are snapshots that contain significantly more data than standard snapshots. Encoding rich hits increases overhead.  The ET_NO_RICH_HITS flag turns this feature off.




#### How does the CET agent disable log statement capture for the log view?

There are two ways to disable the CET agent's log statement capture for the log view:
- For the environment variable, use the parameter ET_NO_CEREBRO
- For the JVM argument, use the parameter -Dharness.no.cerebro




#### What is the significance of utilizing the ET_NO_CEREBRO parameter for the CET agent?

Using the ET_NO_CEREBRO paramter for the CET Micro-Agent disables log statement capture for the log view. It potentially provides significant performance benefits. Log capture can affect Garbage Collection when logs are dense. This does not affect recording of logged errors and logged warnings as events.




#### Is there a way to disable all instrumentation of any bytecode with the CET agent?

There are two ways to disable all instrumentation of any bytecode with the CET agent:
- For the environment variable, use the parameter ET_NO_TREX
- For the JVM argument, use the parameter -Dharness.no.trex




#### What happens when the ET_NO_TREX parameter is used when attempting to disable instrumentation of any bytecode?

The ET_NO_TREX parameter is used with the CET Micro-Agent to disable all instrumentation across the board. This, in essence, invalidates CET (error rates, timers, etc), but can be used to diagnose performance issues resulting from bytecode instrumentation.




#### Is there a way to disable instrumentation and collection of event statistics with the CET agent?

There are two ways to disable instrumentation and collection of event statistics with the CET agent:
- For the environment variable, use the parameter ET_NO_REQ_INV

#### Is there a way to disable all dynamic class instrumentation with the CET agent?

There are two ways to disable all dynamic class instrumentation with the CET agent:
- For the environment variable, use the parameter ET_NO_DYNAMIC_INST
- For the JVM argument, use the parameter -Dharness.no.dynamic.inst




#### When using the ET_NO_DYNAMIC_INST parameter with the CET agent, what instrumentation is being disabled?

The CET Micro-Agent uses the ET_NO_DYNAMIC_INST parameter to disable all dynamic class instrumentation:

- Disables a complementary mechanism needed for optimizations to make sure we evacuate snapshots properly in JIT compiled mode. This issue could be seen in rare edge cases. (no Salinger)
- Disables our timer mechanisms (Chronos & Parallax)
- Logged error and warning small performance optimization
- Metrics such as the Error Rate will not show.




#### Does using the ET_NO_DYNAMIC_INST flag eliminate the use of other parameters with the CET agent?

Using this parameters equats to using all of the following flags within the CET Micro-Agent:
-Dtakipi.no.req.inv
-Dtakipi.no.contexts
-Dtakipi.no.lf
-Dtakipi.no.tfa
-Dtakipi.no.chronos

There will not be the need of using any of the flags above if utilizing a flag to disable all dynamic class instrumentation.




#### Is there a way to disable a group of performance-related features with the CET agent?

There are two ways to disable a group of performance-related features with the CET agent:
- For the environment variable, use the parameter ET_OPTIMIZED_MODE

-Dtakipi.no.xmen
-Dtakipi.no.req.inv
-Dtakipi.no.contexts
-Dtakipi.no.fin
-Dtakipi.concurrency.level=1

Using the ET_OPTIMIZED_MODE parameter disables these performance-related features to determine what is causing performance issues.




#### Is there a way to display the CET agent's internal log messages to the standard output screen?

There are two ways to display the CET agent's internal log messages to the standard output screen:
- For the environment variable, use the parameter ET_LOG_TO_CONSOLE
- For the JVM argument, use the parameter -Dharness.log.to.console




#### What is the purpose of using the ET_LOG_TO_CONSOLE parameter for the CET agent?

The ET_LOG_TO_CONSOLE parameter makes the CET Micro-Agent write its internal log messages to the standard output instead of writing to the CET agent log file.

This flag adds verbose debugging to all logs whenever turned on as long as the server is on; to stop, the JVM application needs to restart the service without the flag.  It is recommended to use this flag for a limited time to figure out problems with the CET agent.




#### How can the CET agent change the location of its log file?

There are two ways to change the CET Micro-Agent's location of its log file:
- For the environment variable, use the parameter ET_LOG_FILE
- For the JVM argument, use the parameter -Dharness.log.file

Example: -Dharness.log.file=\<path/to/file.log>




#### When would it be beneficial to use the parameter ET_LOG_FILE with the CET agent?

The ET_LOG_FILE paramter within the CET agent helps in the event the agent logs are not being sent to Harness.  This solves communication issues between the CET Micro-Agent and Harness.

Note: The log file must be in an existing path.




#### How does the CET agent print debug log statements to the standard output?

There are two ways the CET agent prints debug log statements to the standard output:
- For the environment variable, use the parameter ET_SILENT

#### What are the supported programming languages that are supported by the CET agent?

The CET agent currently supports Java as well as other languages that run on top of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM):
- Java (minimum version 6.0)
- Kotlin (minimum version 1.5 with source attach as a requirement)
- Scala (minimum version 2.0 with source attach as a requirement)



#### While Kotlin and Scala are programming languages supported by the CET agent, why is it a requirement to use source attach with it?

Harness recommends utilizing source attach when using programming languages that either run on top of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) or non-Java languages with the CET agent.  Source files may be missing when running the CET agent with these languages.  The CET agent uses decompiled sources to display the application's code.  Since the decompiler only supports Java and code generated by non-Java languages may not appear, using the source attach feature will allow the user to have the source code available without having to decompile the source code from the source files obtained by the CET agent.

#### I have many environments with different ServiceIDs within OverOps.  How can I manage these when moving to CET within Harness?

The best way to handle the different environments with its different ServiceIDs within OverOps is to create new projects for each ServiceID being used within the Harness platform.  This way, one can setup their different services being used when transitioning over from OverOps to Harness using the CET module.

There may be other ways to configure the environments.  This would be something that would be addressed internally within your team's discussions on how to layout these environments to best suit your needs.



#### OverOps has different services to represent different environments using different ServiceIDs.  How does the CET module within the Harness platform designate the different services as different environments?

The CET module has the ability to create different services along with creating different environments in each service.  This would be handled within the Monitored Services section.

For instance, we have a service called JavaJam which has a preprod and a prod environment.
Within OverOps, we would have different ServiceIDs for each environment.  One ServiceID to represent preprod for JavaJam, and another ServiceID to represent prod for JavaJam.
In Harness, the Monitored Services will allow you to have one service (i.e. JavaJam) and have multiple environments under this service (one for preprod, one for prod, etc).
This will allow more organization of your environments within one service.

Please visit the following page for steps on how to create your monitored service in the CET module:
https://developer.harness.io/docs/continuous-error-tracking/get-started/overops-cet-migration#add-a-monitored-service




#### I was able to start the CET agent, but noticed that the monitored service is appearing under a different service section.  What is causing this and how can we make it appear in the correct monitored service?

It may be possible that even though it is appearing under the correct project, the monitored service information may need to be updated to reflect correctly.

Ensure that the following fields are entered correctly with their proper information:
- ET_COLLECTOR_URL=assigned based on which Harness cluster the account is assigned to
- ET_APPLICATION_NAME=name of the monitored service
- ET_ENV_ID=name of the environment obtained within the monitored service
- ET_TOKEN=created individually for the service to be monitored by the CET agent



#### How can I ensure I can control which JVM to monitor and not have any JVM connect to my monitored services without my consent?

In order to authorize a JVM be montitored by the CET agent, a unique token must be presented and passed as an argument.  Using this unique token provides a way for users to control which JVMs are monitored while preventing other JVMs from being added without the consent of the project's admin.  One can do so by either creating a new token or copying an already existing one.  Details on how to create a token can be found using the following link:
https://developer.harness.io/docs/continuous-error-tracking/get-started/onboarding-guide#create-a-token-for-the-error-tracking-agent



#### I have various types of deployments within my organization.  What kinds of installation services are available to use with the CET agent?

There are various ways one can install and deploy the CET agent to monitor a Java application.  The following are ways one can install the CET agent:
- Standalone installation via tar file and extracting under a desired directory
- Modifying your Docker image to include the CET agent
- Using an init container such as within Kubernetes to automatically install the CET agent at runtime without changing any existing images
