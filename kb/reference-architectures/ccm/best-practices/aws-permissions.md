# CCM AWS Permissions

When creating a Harness IAM Role in AWS for CCM, there are many different permissions sets based on the features you are trying to leverage in specific accounts. This guide is meant to cover all the different features of CCM and the permissions you need to assign to enable them.

To enable specific features on a connector you need to set a specific string in the `featuresEnabled` field (list) in the connector YAML. The keys for each feature are listed in the sections below.

## Testing permissions

No matter the feature you are using, when testing connector health in the UI Harness attempts to check it own access using `iam:SimulatePrincipalPolicy`.

```json
{
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": "iam:SimulatePrincipalPolicy",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::{AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}:role/{ROLE_NAME}",
            "Sid": ""
        }
    ],
    "Version": "2012-10-17"
}
```

## Cost Ingestion

featuresEnabled:  `BILLING`

To ingest cost from AWS, Harness leverages a Cost and Usage Report (CUR) that is generated by AWS. These reports are delivered to an S3 bucket in your payer account. When assigning permissions we will need access to both read the bucket where the CUR reports are being delivered and write to a Harness owned bucket so that we can recive the data and load it into your Harness account.

We also include some permissions for Organizations so we can collect things like account names, account tags and access to see the definition of the CUR to make sure it matches Harness standards.

```json
{
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:GetBucketLocation"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::{YOUR_CUR_BUCKET_NAME}/*",
                "arn:aws:s3:::{YOUR_CUR_BUCKET_NAME}"
            ],
            "Sid": "readBillingBucket"
        },
        {
            "Action": [
                "s3:PutObjectAcl",
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:ListBucket"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::{HARNESS_S3_BUCKET}*/*",
                "arn:aws:s3:::{HARNESS_S3_BUCKET}*"
            ],
            "Sid": "writeHarnessBucket"
        },
        {
            "Action": [
                "organizations:List*",
                "organizations:Describe*",
                "cur:DescribeReportDefinitions"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "*",
            "Sid": "readOrg"
        }
    ],
    "Version": "2012-10-17"
}
```

In the above policy `{YOUR_CUR_BUCKET_NAME}` needs to be replaced with your S3 bucket where CUR reports are being delivered.

`{HARNESS_S3_BUCKET}` is the Harness S3 bucket where your CUR will be copied to. This bucket changes based on your Harness account, but most customers will use `ce-customer-billing-data-prod`.

## Events/Inventory

featuresEnabled:  `VISIBILITY`

To let Harness collect inventory data (used in dashboards) you need to give read permissions to EC2, RDS, ECS and Cloudwatch.

```json
{
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "rds:DescribeDBSnapshots",
                "rds:DescribeDBSnapshotAttributes",
                "rds:DescribeDBInstances",
                "rds:DescribeDBClusters",
                "ecs:ListTasks",
                "ecs:ListServices",
                "ecs:ListContainerInstances",
                "ecs:ListClusters*",
                "ecs:DescribeTasks",
                "ecs:DescribeServices",
                "ecs:DescribeContainerInstances",
                "ecs:DescribeClusters",
                "ec2:DescribeVolumes",
                "ec2:DescribeSnapshots",
                "ec2:DescribeRegions",
                "ec2:DescribeInstances*",
                "cloudwatch:GetMetricData"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "*",
            "Sid": "inventory"
        }
    ],
    "Version": "2012-10-17"
}
```

## Asset Governance

featuresEnabled:  `GOVERNANCE`

When enabling asset governance it is best practice to start with a read-only policy so you can run rules in dry-run, receive out-of-the-box recommendations, and begin to create your own custom governance recommendations.

We suggest you use the AWS-provided `ViewOnlyAccess` policy which will allow Harness to access AWS resources in a read-only manner.

`arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/job-function/ViewOnlyAccess`

Once you are ready to perform actions using governance, you can create a custom policy to allow only the actions you want to take via governance, or use built-in policies to provide whatever access you are comfortable with.

For example if you are going to begin auto-deleting snapshots using governance, you might assign `ec2:DeleteSnapshot` or `arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonEC2FullAccess`.

## Commitment Orchestrator

featuresEnabled:  `COMMITMENT_ORCHESTRATOR`

To start getting your commitment coverage information you can provide read-only access in your payer account.

```json
{
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "savingsplans:DescribeSavingsPlans",
                "organizations:DescribeOrganization",
                "ec2:DescribeReservedInstancesOfferings",
                "ec2:DescribeReservedInstances",
                "ec2:DescribeInstanceTypeOfferings",
                "ce:GetSavingsPlansUtilizationDetails",
                "ce:GetSavingsPlansUtilization",
                "ce:GetSavingsPlansCoverage",
                "ce:GetReservationUtilization",
                "ce:GetReservationCoverage",
                "ce:GetDimensionValues"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "*",
            "Sid": "viewcoverage"
        }
    ],
    "Version": "2012-10-17"
}
```

Once you set up the orchestrator and are ready to approve recommendations, you can give access to make purchases.

```json
{
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "ec2:PurchaseReservedInstancesOffering",
                "ec2:ModifyReservedInstances",
                "ec2:GetReservedInstancesExchangeQuote",
                "ec2:DescribeReservedInstancesModifications",
                "ec2:DescribeInstanceTypeOfferings",
                "ec2:AcceptReservedInstancesExchangeQuote"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "*",
            "Sid": "purchase"
        }
    ],
    "Version": "2012-10-17"
}
```

## Autostopping

featuresEnabled:  `OPTIMIZATION`

Autostopping has many ways to optimize resource usage and reduce costs. Across AWS, Azure, GCP and the different compute and routing products between them there are many possible permissions needed. Based on your cloud platform, compute, and application architecture you can use the following information to build a least-privileged policy.

### AWS

| ec2:DeregisterImage ec2:DeleteSnapshot                                          | Delete snapshot after deleting Autostopping rule             |
