## What is Harness Solutions Factory?
Harness Solutions Factory (HSF) is a value-added service provided by the Harness team. It's a scalable automation framework to manage Harness resources. HSF provides Terraform templates for managing the Harness Platform. It creates all resources needed to deploy the Harness Solutions Factory, along with example and best practice templates for platform usage.

Currently, HSF leverages three key Harness components: Code Repository for code storage, Infrastructure as Code Management for Terraform administration, and Internal Developer Portal to host automated workflows.
