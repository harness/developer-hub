title: Cannot Define EBS Volumes When Deploying Baked AMI
---

## Issue
When deploying a baked AMI, it is currently not possible to define the EBS characteristics of the volumes via the UI.  The AMI as it is baked will be the AMI that is deployed.

## Cause
Deck currently does not allow for EBS volume definitions.
