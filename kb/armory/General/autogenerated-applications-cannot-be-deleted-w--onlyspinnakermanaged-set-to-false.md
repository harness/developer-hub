title: Autogenerated Applications Cannot be Deleted w/ onlySpinnakerManaged set to false
---

## Issue
When enabling ```onlySpinnakerManaged: false``` applications will be generated to populate the Spinnaker console based on the Kubernetes environment and account assigned in the Accounts declaration of either the **Halyard** ([https://docs.armory.io/docs/armory-admin/kubernetes-account-add/#how-spinnaker-operates-when-deploying-to-kubernetes-targets](https://docs.armory.io/docs/armory-admin/kubernetes-account-add/#how-spinnaker-operates-when-deploying-to-kubernetes-targets)) or **Operator** ([https://docs.armory.io/docs/installation/operator-reference/providers/#account-parameters-8](https://docs.armory.io/docs/installation/operator-reference/providers/#account-parameters-8)) configuration.The ingestion and creation of these **Autogenerated Applications Placeholders** is based on the naming convention of resources in KubernetesAttempting to manage or delete the applications can sometimes lead to the following displayed error where ```The application tenant has not been configured``` is displayed and the application cannot be deleted


## Cause
The way this legacy item works is if set to false, is that it will then attempt configure applications for resources in Kubernetes, based on what the Spinnaker environment is able to see. However, this feature can end up picking up information incorrectly and attempt to populate the Spinnaker environment with Autogenerated Applications Placeholders that were unintended.  The application doesn't actually exist, and then the Autogenerated Applications Placeholders are misconfigured and do not correlate to resources properly.  If changes are also made to the Kubernetes cluster, this will further complicate things by causing the error message aboveMaking things more difficult is that MySQL doesn't have an automatic cleanup to remove these misconfigured Autogernerated applications, unlike in REDIS, which can have an auto expiry set that will respect the change of the ```onlySpinnakerManaged``` value back to ```true```.
