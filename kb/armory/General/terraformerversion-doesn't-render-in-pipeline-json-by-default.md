title: terraformer Version doesn't render in pipeline JSON by default
---

## Issue
When creating a terraform pipeline, the 'terraformerVersion' doesn't render in pipeline JSON by default. Users have to manually select the dropdown and choose the version even though the default is picked.


## Cause
A bug in Deck causes this issue, and has since been resolved.
