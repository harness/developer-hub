title: Can Users' Level of Access in the Armory Console be Retricted using RBAC
---

## Introduction
Customers may want to restrict the level of access certain users within their organizations have to certain tasks and functions.  These can include, but are not limited to
* Inviting additional users to the CDaaS organization
* Adding additional accounts or environments* Which environments are visible
* Amount of access a user may have in a particular environment

## Prerequisites
Customers will need to have purchased a tier of CDaaS that includes RBAC.  This would include setting up a Trial version with our Sales team or purchase a full Enterprise license.

## Instructions
Currently, it is not possible to make this restriction, but it is a part of our delivery of our RBAC implementation.  Please look forward to more information in mid/late Summer 2022.  
For more information, please subscribe to this knowledge article, as it will be updated once RBAC functionality has launched.
