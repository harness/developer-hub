Customer Administrators are privileged customer users who have been granted additional access and management rights to the ServiceNow Portal. Customers should inform Support or the designated TAM about any changes that need to happen with regards to their assigned administrator. Because the administrator has additional privileges, please be aware of the following information when assigning administrators.
