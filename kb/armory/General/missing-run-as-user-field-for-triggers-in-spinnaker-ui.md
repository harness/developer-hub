title: Missing Run As User field for triggers in Spinnaker UI
---

## Issue
Customers may find that the** **```Run As User``` field under Automated Triggers is missing in UI and has the Permissions field instead.

 

## Cause
When the pipeline permissions is enabled, it is expected that ```Run As User``` field in Spinnaker UI is not visible.
