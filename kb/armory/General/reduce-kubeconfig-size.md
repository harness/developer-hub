title: Reduce kubeconfig Size
---

## Issue
If youâ€™re seeing issues with halyard taking forever or complaining that your kubeconfig is too large, it may be worth reducing your kubeconfig or removing unnecessary certificate authorities from your kubeconfig.

## Cause
Kubeconfig file sizes can cause a long time to load because of the way kubeconfig yaml files are parsed
