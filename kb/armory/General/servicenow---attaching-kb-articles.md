Attaching KB Articles to a Case (newly created or old)
Attaching KB articles advises about how useful our KBs are currently. This can be done at any time during the case, but definitely needs to be reviewed and completed at the end of a case
Attaching KB articles that have already been created
* Log in to the ```ServiceNow Admin Portal```* Locate the ```Case``` in question* At the very bottom, where the **SLAs **Tab is, there is a tab for **Attached Knowledge*** Click on the **Edit...** button* Find all KBs and their versions in the **left column** and click on the **right arrow** in the middle to add it to the attached Knowledge list.* Click on Save. The tab should now have the attached articles
Attaching KB Articles that are Newly Created
There are several ways to create a KB article as a part of a ticket, but if you are not going to click on the **Create Article Button** to generate the article and association with the case, then [you can do so separately](https://support.armory.io/support?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0010045) and then attach it to the case following the steps below
* At the bottom of the case, where the **SLAs** tab is, there is a tab for **Created Knowledge*** Click on the **New** button* Next to the **Article Field**, there's a **magnifying glass** to the right of it. **Click on it** to locate the article in question that has already be created* Click on the **article display number field** for the relevant article in the window that has popped up* Click on **Submit*** The article should now be listed
