title: Salesforce to ServiceNow Service Portal Migration
---



In the end of February, we will be migrating all of our Support Issues, Knowledge Base, and Customers from Salesforce to ServiceNow. We will be re-routing our URLs (e.g. [https://kb.armory.io](https://kb.armory.io/), [https://portal.armory.io,](https://portal.armory.io%2C/) [https://registration.armory.io](https://registration.armory.io/)) to the ServiceNow portal on our go-live date, **March 1st, 2021**
## **The following are useful articles for our Customers to help them get started**
* [Support Portal User Registration](https://support.armory.io/support?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0010200)* [Password Resets](https://support.armory.io/support?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0010247)* [Creating Cases and Case Management in ServiceNow](https://support.armory.io/support?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0010136)* [Creating Change Requests in ServiceNow](https://support.armory.io/support?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0010267)* [ServiceNow Service Portal Customer Administrators](https://support.armory.io/support?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0010240)* [Global Technical Support - Case Statuses](https://support.armory.io/support?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0010011)* [Case Escalations](https://armory.service-now.com/support?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0010203)
What does this mean for our customers?
* Customers will be using ServiceNow moving forward, and will not need to worry about accessing information through Salesforce again* Access controls will be placed so that only privileged Service Portal Customer Administrator Users will be able to register users. This is to emphasize self management for our customers while providing them added security on access to their company tickets.  They can also disable users* Users have the ability to review tickets for the entire account* If a user has **ever** logged a Support Issue in Salesforce, we have migrated both the issues and users. Issue statuses will also be synced along with any comments* A better ticketing process, with added connection opportunities with our customers
What does this mean for Armory?
* The knowledge base will be more easily navigated, with an easier to see layout* Groundwork to allow for future functionality and expansion plans* A portal designed to provide customers with a definitive support experience
Customer Administrators for Customer Accounts
* We will be reaching out to customers to provide us some information with regards to who should be administering their account on ServiceNow* At least a primary and secondary admin for a customer account will be requested* For more information about Customer Administrators and their rights, please review [https://kb.armory.io/s/article/ServiceNow-Service-Portal-Customer-Administrators](https://kb.armory.io/s/article/ServiceNow-Service-Portal-Customer-Administrators)
How to Gain Access
Registration will now be handled by customer's provided administrators. Administrators should be approached to attain a ServiceNow service portal account.
Automated self-registration is no longer available, to ensure that customers have the control to manage the security and access.
Service portal accounts provide:
* Ability to open and manage tickets that the user has opened* Access to non-public articles
Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions.  We thank you for your patience and help during this transitional time.
