title: No "Expected Artifacts" Field
---

## Issue
Spinnaker is installed, and users are trying to configure artifacts, but donâ€™t see the ```Expected Artifacts``` field in the configuration tab of the Spinnaker pipelines

## Cause
Functions need to be enabled in order for them to appear available in Deck.
