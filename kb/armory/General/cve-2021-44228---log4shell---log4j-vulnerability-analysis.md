## Issue
A potentially critical 0-day exploit CVE was identified on ***Dec 10, 2021***. 
[https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228)
Armory has investigated this 0-day critical issue, and has performed analysis on the vulnerability and its potential for harm to Armory Enterprise customers.
 

## Cause
The vulnerability exposes a ***remote-execution vulnerability*** in services that use ```log4j```. Spinnaker services use ```logback```, a different logging implementation.
Here are some examples of how the vulnerability might be exploited:[https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/RCE+in+log4j+Log4Shell+or+how+things+can+get+bad+quickly/28120/](https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/RCE+in+log4j+Log4Shell+or+how+things+can+get+bad+quickly/28120/)[https://www.lunasec.io/docs/blog/log4j-zero-day/#example-vulnerable-code](https://www.lunasec.io/docs/blog/log4j-zero-day/#example-vulnerable-code)
The affected class ```org.apache.logging.log4j.core.lookup.JndiLookup``` is not bundled with Armory Enterprise.
This was validated by inspecting service dependencies, logs from active services and thread profiling services to ensure the affected class is neither packaged or used.
