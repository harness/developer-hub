title: Critical Technical Notifications
---


As a part of being an Armory customer, our crew would like to make sure our customers are well informed of any issues discovered about Armory's products and services.
At Armory, we have implemented a **Critical Technical Notifications** mailing list.
This mailing list will provide a direct line of communication with your **Armory Enterprise Environment Administrative team(s)** and advise them about **future discovered critical issues.**
#### Topics expected to be covered by the mailing list
* Security notifications* Emergency updates* Configuration changes that should be planned in advance
This is **NOT a marketing list**. We will only use this distribution list to send critical updates relevant to your Armory Admin Team.
#### What Armory needs from your team
We ask that arrangements are made to create a Distribution List and to then provide your Account Manager or the Support Team the email address of the Distribution List.  We recommend that this be prioritized so that your team does not miss any notifications.
Customers may also receive these notifications within their Armory Slack channel or customer Slack channel. 
#### Benefits of a distribution list that is managed by your company
* Full control of who gets critical Armory notifications (subscribing and unsubscribing)* Flexibility to integrate notifications with the communication system of choice (Teams, Slack, etc)* Building the management of the distribution list into the customer's own internal processes for onboarding and offboarding of employees
