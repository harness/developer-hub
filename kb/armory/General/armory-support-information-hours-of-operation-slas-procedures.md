Armory offers a variety of support options depending on your needs. With the resources below, customers should be able to find answers to any questions regarding their support contract and what kind of service-level agreements to be expected as a customer of Armory. There are many ways to contact support, but our first suggestion is always to check our documentation at [docs.armory.io](http://docs.armory.io/) or our [kb.armory.io](https://kb.armory.io) as we constantly seek to improve our customers’ self-service experience.
 
A self-service experience is impactful because support no longer becomes a bottleneck to resolving your issues. We will be here to assist if the need arises. Armory's Support focuses our time and attention on enhancing our documentation, knowledge base, and automation to ensure that a customer's overall experience with Armory is as streamlined and efficient as possible.
 
If you can’t find an answer to your question or concern at any given time, you can submit an issue with Armory Support.  Customers looking to register can do so by contacting their appointed [ServiceNow Service Portal Customer Administrators](https://support.armory.io/support?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0010240). Once registered, please submit tickets at [support.armory.io](https://support.armory.io/).

Communication Methods
* Armory ServiceDesk Platform at [support.armory.io](https://support.armory.io/)* Slack for informal communications (a Slack message will not trigger our alerting system for Priority 0 cases; hence we recommend defaulting to issue submission via the Armory ServiceDesk).
Phone Support
On-demand **phone support is currently not an offering** at any Armory Support level, with one exception. If both parties deem a phone call necessary, we will provide an on-demand Zoom call or a scheduled Zoom call to ensure that the necessary context is captured in advance and necessary parties are involved. 
 
**The only exception is in specific cases for which customers require a P0 resolution**.  For more details, please refer to the following documentation available to [Armory Customers about P0 Case-handling](https://support.armory.io/support?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0010776#phone) (the document is only available to customers that have a login to our Support Portal).
 
#### Issue Creation
We highly suggest [enabling Armory Diagnostics](https://docs.armory.io/armory-enterprise/armory-admin/observe/diagnostics-configure/).  This allows our team to gather information about the current state of your environment and allows us to skip a few steps in our initial investigation, allowing for a quicker resolution.  Customers can also use and implement the [Armory Support Bundle within their environment](https://support.armory.io/support?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0010430) to provide the Customer's current configuration of their Spinnaker environment to the Support Team.
When submitting an Armory issue to the support team, please include as much detail as possible to ensure we have all the context to start our triaging. The more meaningful context provided, the quicker the path to resolution will be. Customers can also request a Zoom call from the Support Engineer assigned to their case.
 
Please visit our [document explaining the Case Submission best practices](https://kb.armory.io/s/article/Case-Submission-Best-Practices) page for more suggestions on optimizing case experiences.

The customer case form will include the following fields to determine the priority on our ServiceDesk. We prevent the change and manual priority adjustment to ensure a consistent customer experience.
