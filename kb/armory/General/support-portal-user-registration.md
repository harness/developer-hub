title: Support Portal User Registration
---


In order to submit cases to Armory, review cases for their team or view customer-only Knowledge Base Articles, users will need to register their information on our ServiceNow Portal. 
Users can reach out to their designated **Service Portal ****Customer Administrator** within their company and have them create an account to complete the registration. 
#### What is a Service Portal Customer Administrator?
Customer Administrators are privileged customer users who have been granted additional access and management rights to the ServiceNow Portal. They have been designated by our customer's organizations as the "managers" of the account who should have elevated privileges
For more information about Customer Administrators, their abilities, and registration, please read the following article:
[https://support.armory.io/support?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0010240](https://support.armory.io/support?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0010240)
#### Why is user registration set up with Customer Administrators?
Armory has created an "administration level" account system for our customers to allow them to have the ability to have stronger security and the ability to audit the memberships of their accounts, yet still provide enough flexibility to monitor and self service their issues.  By providing this function to certain elevated privilege users, our customers can match their internal access and audit requirements.  Customers can review the access of their users at any time.
#### What security issues does this help prevent?
For Armory Managed Customers, providing the ability to audit their user lists helps ensure that only authorized personnel are allowed to request changes to their managed environment. 
Similarly, for general support cases, Armory Support will only be providing information about a customer environment and providing assistance to modify an environment to authorized personnel.
#### What if there are many additional users that need to be added to the Service Portal?
If customers have a massive list of changes, Armory is still available to assist in creating those accounts. In this situation, we request that a list including first and last names and email addresses be provided by your Service Portal Customer Administrator to your Technical Account Manager, or Customer Success Manager.
