For further information about Sales Engineers opening Support Cases, [please check out the slab doc](https://armory.slab.com/posts/sales-engineering-opening-service-now-cases-gqo9yxu5)
### Opening Cases on Behalf of Customers
Sales Engs can easily open cases on behalf of customers and have them assigned to themselves. **Support is here to help with educating and helping Sales Engs, but should not manage the interactions with the customers.**
While it **is technically possible** to add a customer's email to the watchlist of a case so that they get updated, please do not do this when requesting assistance from Support. As advised, Support is supporting the Sales Eng, and adding a customer to the watchlist will mean customers will get access to ask Support questions directly.
This is one method to open a case, and is probably the easiest for Sales Engs.
