title: Is it Possible to Restrict User Access to Certain Envrionments with RBAC
---

## Introduction
Customers may want to restrict certain users to deploying within certain environments.  This may because of least privilege rules, or team distribution.  

## Prerequisites
Customers will need to have purchased a tier of CDaaS that includes RBAC.  This would include setting up a Trial version with our Sales team or purchase a full Enterprise license.

## Instructions
Currently, it is not possible to make this restriction, but it is a part of our delivery of our RBAC implementation.  Please look forward to more information in mid/late Summer 2022.  
For more information, please subscribe to this knowledge article, as it will be updated once RBAC functionality has launched.
