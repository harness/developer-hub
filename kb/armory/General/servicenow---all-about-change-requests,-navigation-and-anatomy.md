title: ServiceNow - All About Change Requests, Navigation and Anatomy
---


Change requests have a numbering scheme that starts with ```ACHG```
They are located in their own section called ```Armory Change Requests``` that can be searched using the Sidebar Navigator

If the view does not match as above, please change the view by clicking on the **hamburger** in the upper right corner of the Change record, and go to **View** â†’ **Armory Change Request**
Change request interactions occur via Jira, and so, there is no interaction from with ServiceNow other than to pass information back to customers.
