---


To help assist customers or Armory Users and ensure that they have roles set properly, it may be necessary to impersonate a user. This provides access to see the portal via the account's access.

## Impersonate a User
### Via Backend Interface
* To do so, click on your name in the upper right corner and select "impersonate user"* Select the appropriate person to test with (either by search, or most recently accessed users)
* You will then be placed at the Support Portal main page with those credentials
### Via URL
* You can also make the change by going to the URL [https://armory.service-now.com/impersonate_dialog.do](https://armory.service-now.com/impersonate_dialog.do)* Selecting the appropriate user
* Click OK

## Revert the credentials back
After the adjustments are made, please set your credentials back to the default.Â  This can be accomplished by
* Going to the URL [https://armory.service-now.com/impersonate_dialog.do](https://armory.service-now.com/impersonate_dialog.do)
* Selecting the appropriate user (yourself)* Click OK
