title: Cases and Change Requests
---


Customers may find themselves needing to submit either a Case or a Change Request within our portal.  The following article should assist customers with understanding when one type of submission should be used over the other.
In order to ensure issues are resolved effectively, we ask that customers please do not mix requests and issue submissions, and to please open separate tickets for separate issues/changes.
### Case Submissions
Customers should open up support cases whenever they have an inquiry or an issue that needs to be addressed.  Support will assist on these cases to either direct them to the correct resources or resolve them for our customers.  If a customer is unsure of whether to open a Change Request, or a Support Case, please default to opening a Support Case.  
Support Cases are also the only method by which a customer can initiate a P0 response.  
For detailed information about submitting cases, please read the following about [Creating Cases and Case Management in ServiceNow](https://support.armory.io/support?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0010136)
For customers who have mixed instances of both Armory Self-Hosted and Armory Managed Spinnaker environments, please note that any cases related Armory Self-Hosted environments will be resolved by the Armory Support team.
### Change Request Submissions
Customers should open change requests whenever they require Armory to make changes to their Armory Managed Services environment.  Examples include adding accounts or creating configuration changes
