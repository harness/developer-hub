title: BitBucket Cloud vs BitBucket on Premises
---


BitBucket Cloud and BitBucket on Premises APIs are divergent from each other up until certain versions. 
Some references may break due to API changes in future versions poorly communicated to the public.  For example, [https://support.armory.io/support?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0010059](https://support.armory.io/support?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0010059) has happened previously for BitBucket On-Prem, but it also happens between On-Prem and Cloud.
When testing Bitbucket issues, it is important to match the customer's versions and types.   So, if a customer is using the cloud, the solution needs to be developed for the cloud version tested and verified with the cloud version.
If a customer uses an On-Prem version, we have to use the same On-Prem version to test and verify.
