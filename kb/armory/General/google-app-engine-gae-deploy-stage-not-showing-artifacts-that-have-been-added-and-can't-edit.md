title: Google App Engine (GAE) Deploy Stage Not Showing Artifacts That Have Been Added and Can't Edit
---

## Issue
When creating a pipeline for **Google App Engine (GAE)** deployment, Spinnaker does not show previously configured **Config Artifacts **under the App Engine provider in Deployment Configuration in the Deploy stage.The stage initially wouldn't correctly show the artifacts that have been added and it also wouldn't allow a user to edit them.

## Cause
Impaired function. Code fix required.
