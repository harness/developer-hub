title: CVE-2022-3786 / CVE-2022-3602- OpenSSL 3.x Vulnerability Analysis
---

## Issue
An OpenSSL vulnerability has been partially publicly disclosed regards OpenSSL >= 3.0.0.  [A new version of OpenSSL, 3.0.7, was released on Nov 1st addressing the relevant vulnerabilities](https://mta.openssl.org/pipermail/openssl-announce/2022-October/000238.html).
Armory has confirmed that Armory CDSH contains **OpenSSL 1.1.1** in versions 2.26.5, 2.27.4, and 2.28.0, and is therefore not currently a part of the OpenSSL 3.x vulnerability.  No action is required for Armory customers at this time.
The OpenSSL Project has advised that a security fix for versions lower than 3.0.0 is unnecessary.  *Although a release for 1.1.1 is planned for release on Nov 1st (v1.1.1s), [according to OpenSSL is not related to the critical CVE](https://mta.openssl.org/pipermail/openssl-announce/2022-October/000240.html) and [has been announced as a bug fix](https://mta.openssl.org/pipermail/openssl-announce/2022-October/000239.html).*
