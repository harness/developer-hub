title: Escalating a Case
---


Case escalations can be a powerful tool to advise our Support Team of a change to the issue that was raised. The purpose of this ability is to allow customers to advise Support about certain changes
To ensure that a consistent experience is provided to all customers, we ask that case escalations be used sporadically and only when they are **absolutely necessary** because of a one-off situation where there is a specific need/business use-case.  
We ask that escalations be limited to the following reasons, and we would like to advise that the support team does reserve the right to decline any requests that may be raised, although we will give our best effort to meet most requests
* **Executive Visibility*** **Lack of Progress*** **Customer Imposed Deadline**
 
Note that under normal circumstances, the SLA procedure follows the response matrix as defined in the [Armory Support Information (Hours of Operation/SLAs/Procedures) page](https://kb.armory.io/s/article/Support).
## How to Escalate a Case (P1-P3)
* Log in to the ServiceNow Customer portal* In the Navigation Menu, select **Cases -> All Cases**. Locate the case that requires an escalation* At the bottom of the case, next to the **Close Case** button, there will be a **Request Escalation** button available.  Click on this button to begin the processOnce this button is clicked, two mandatory fields will appear above, asking to provide
* **Escalation Reason**: Can chose from **Executive Visibility**, **Lack of Progress**, and **Customer Imposed Deadline*** **Escalation Description**: Description about the issue to be provided to the Support Engineers, so that it is clear why the escalation should be approved. 
* Click on the **Request Escalation** button again to submit* At this point, the escalation will be reviewed by a Senior Support Engineer for its viability before **approval** or **rejection**.  In the case that a request for escalation is not approved, a reason will be provided within the case that explains why the escalation did not proceed.
## How to Escalate a Case (P0)
Customers who are looking to get ahold of Armory Support in a P0 situation where a case was raised, but now requires P0 attention due to the growing severity and radius of the issue, can look to escalate the case by phone.  The following service is only available to Armory Customers with a service agreement: [https://support.armory.io/support?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0010776#phone](https://support.armory.io/support?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0010776#phone)
