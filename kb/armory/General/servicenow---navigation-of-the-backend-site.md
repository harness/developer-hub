Sidebar Navigator
The sidebar navigator is the area that most Armory users will be using to navigate around ServiceNow. This navigator will take you from section to section, allow you to go to Favorites and Historical sections that you have been to. There are a few tips that will help with the Navigation
One thing to note is that the Sidebar Navigator can at anytime, be collapsed, by using the Left Arrow, in the bottom left of the screen.
Filter Navigator
The Filter Navigator field acts as a search filter for the various different sections that users will want to navigate to. If you want to look for Cases, just type that there, and it will bring up options related to cases

Favorites
When you find sections of importance that you would like to return to, click on the **Star** to fill in the star and favorite it. You can favorite both an entire section, or individual parts of a subsection.
Once the items are favorited, they will appear in the Star tab.
You can re-order your Favorites by clicking on the pencil icon at the bottom of the Sidebar Navigator

The history tab will display historical searches and pages that have been navigated to by your account. It is a great way to trace back steps if you accidentally lose the section that you have been working in
