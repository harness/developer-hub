title: Rosco's bakesCompleted_seconds_count metric unavailable in Prometheus
---

## Issue
After installing the Observability Plugin, the ```bakesCompleted``` metric set (count, max & sum) from Rosco is not displayed in Prometheus even though the Prometheus Targets screen shows that all pods being up and being scraped regularly.
Â 
Port forwarding the Rosco pod and hitting the ```/aop-prometheus``` endpoint shows metrics are registered but not the ```bakesCompleted``` metrics set. The metrics are also not visible in Grafana.


## Cause
For ```Observability Plugin version v1.2.1``` - A successful bake is required after plugin installation for the metric to be registered.

If ```Observability plugin v1.2.0``` is being used there is a [bug (resolved in v1.2.1)](https://github.com/armory-plugins/armory-observability-plugin/issues/26) that will prevent some metrics being displayed in Prometheus as well as the above.
