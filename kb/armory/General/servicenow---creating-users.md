title: ServiceNow - Creating Users
---


**Note: **Do not click on the New button at the ```Users``` table to create a new user.  This will create a user under the ```Users``` table, but the user needs to be created under the ```Contact``` table instead.
#### Check if the User Exists
* Navigate to the Admin site and check out the ```Users``` table to see if the person was already created, but just can't log in.[https://support.armory.io/nav_to.do?uri=%2Fsys_user_list.do%3Fsysparm_userpref_module%3Dc5aa0fff0a0a0aa7009a39da035ea396%26sysparm_clear_stack%3Dtrue](https://support.armory.io/nav_to.do?uri=%2Fsys_user_list.do%3Fsysparm_userpref_module%3Dc5aa0fff0a0a0aa7009a39da035ea396%26sysparm_clear_stack%3Dtrue)* If the user exists already, check to see if the account is ```active```, and ```not locked out```.  If those value are set correctly they will just need to [reset their password](https://support.armory.io/support?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0010247)* Otherwise, we'll need to add the user
Create/Add the User (Customer)
* To start navigate to [https://support.armory.io](https://support.armory.io) and Log in as Support.* Go to **Manage Accounts > Users List. ** If you are in the Administration View, look for **Create a User** under the **Armory** heading in the Navigator Bar***** This should redirect you to a list view of all current users in your account. As an example, for Support, this is will show all the people in our account, which is our team. (If doing this as an internal user, this should list all users for you).* Click on the **Create User** button which should redirect you to a form.* Simply fill out the mandatory fields denoted by the * icon and the user should be added once submitted.* Again, **internal Armory users can select which account to create the new user in** while external users can only add users in their current account. Internal Armory users can create users for customers when needed.  *Please Copy and Paste the information provided by the customer to ensure there are fewer errors*.* **Please Note: **The account you select for a user, determines their security permissions, and which company the user is tied to. Please review to make sure that the correct account is selected, or adjustments may need to be made later on.  * Send the user instructions about how to reset their password to gain access.  [https://support.armory.io/support?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0010247](https://support.armory.io/support?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0010247)
The customer admin field will always be left as uneditable and should be pre-populated when navigating to the Create New User form. This is so that we can track of who created what users.
For external users to have the ability to create users, they must have the ```customer_admin``` role. By default, we've provided this role to two users in each account. For more information about [Primary and Secondary accounts, please visit the KB](https://support.armory.io/support?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0010201)

[https://app.rippling.com/employee-list](https://app.rippling.com/employee-list)* Once the user is created, we will need to correlate the user with the Jira user.  In the ServiceNow Administration backend, please search ```Users``` in the Navigation Bar, or go to [the following link](https://support.armory.io/nav_to.do?uri=%2Fsys_user_list.do%3Fsysparm_userpref_module%3D56e8b9ce3718200044e0bfc8bcbe5d00%26sysparm_clear_stack%3Dtrue)* Find the user(s) that you have created.  Click on the user name.Check that the user has the correct ```Group``` assigned in the additional tabs at the bottom of the profile.  They should be in the same group as the company designated for the user which was selected upon creation
