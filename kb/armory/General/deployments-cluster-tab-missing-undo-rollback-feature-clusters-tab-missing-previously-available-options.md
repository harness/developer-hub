title: Deployments Cluster Tab missing "Undo Rollback" feature / Clusters Tab Missing Previously Available Options
---

## Issue
The Clusters Tab does not show the "Undo Rollout" feature in the console UI.  It was once available but is no longer seen after an upgrade. 
It is also missing options to scale deployments and possibly other features.  
 

## Cause
This issue is a result of the Infrastructure UI change that was added in 2.26.
The following release notes correspond with the change:[https://docs.armory.io/docs/release-notes/rn-armory-spinnaker/armoryspinnaker_v2-26-0/#kubernetes-infrastructure-in-the-ui](https://docs.armory.io/docs/release-notes/rn-armory-spinnaker/armoryspinnaker_v2-26-0/#kubernetes-infrastructure-in-the-ui)
