title: Armory Priority Zero (P0) Case Handling Procedures
---


Armory Customers with a Support Service agreement may be required to open a case with the Armory Support team to track production outages within their production environment.  Depending on the severity of the issue, customers are encouraged to open a Priority Zero (P0) level case with our Support team for assistance

### When should a Priority Zero case be opened?
A P0 case should be opened if the environment has
* A Production system critical outage for an Armory product (Armory CD Self Hosted, Armory CD-as-a-Service, Spinnaker OSS, etc.)
* A security incident that requires immediate resolution

If customers are unsure, we suggest opening a case to investigate the situation, and our Support engineers will assist our customers promptly on the issue.  

### How to Open a Support Case
Customers can open a support case of any priority by following the contents of the following KB article:
[Creating Cases and Case Management in Service Now](https://support.armory.io/support?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0010136)

### What are the SLA/Response times on a Successfully Opened Priority Zero Case?
SLAs, including those for P0 cases, can be found below.  Please note that Armory Managed Services Customers will have the same SLAs as CDSH/Premium Support, depending on their contracts.  
**[Armory Essential Support for OSS](https://support.armory.io/support?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0010007#SLAArmoryEssentialOSS) **
**[Armory Continuous Deployment Self-Hosted Support](https://support.armory.io/support?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0010007#SLAArmoryCDSH) **
**[Armory Global Premium Support](https://support.armory.io/support?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0010007#SLAArmoryPremium) **
 
### Alternative Methods to Reach the Support Team
#### Slack
It is highly recommended that customers avoid utilizing Slack to initiate discussion on a P0 issue.  Conversations may proceed to move a conversation to Slack during a case, but they should never be used to call the attention of particular teams and individuals.  
This is because Slack channels are not monitored with SLAs and are often not monitored at all after hours.  
####  Phone Call (Currently in Testing)
Customers have an alternative method of reaching Armory Support once a case has been raised.
This phone number should only be used in certain situations and only after a case has been created
* A case has been opened, but you have not yet received a response after 20 minutes
* A case was opened, but the information provided created a case with a lower priority than intended, and immediate attention is necessary because it is a production system outage with no rollback possible.  (If the case is not a P0, please follow [standard escalation procedures](https://armory.service-now.com/support?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0010203).)
* A case's priority has become a P0 due to changes in the issue, which are now leading to an outage for a production system
* A P0 case is being worked on, but there is a pause/hold/observation period.  The case needs to be picked back up and resumed by the team as something has changed, or the teams are ready to resume working on the production outage issue.

The Armory Support team by phone at the phone number, **+1 415 873 1197**.
### How can a Customer Escalate a non-P0 Case to a P0 Status?
Please use the [Phone Call](#phone) method to reach out to the support team.  This should only be used if the escalation becomes a Production system outage with no rollback (P0 issue).
