title: Technical Support Engineers - Creating Internal Cases to Track Project Work
---


To properly ascertain and track internal project work, Armory Technical Support Engineers are encouraged to open cases to register their work with pre-sales customers and any internal or cross-departmental collaboration projects that may occur.
 
### Work Examples
* OSS Ninja/OSS consultation work in the OSS Slack ChannelSOW collaboration work
* Can include when working on Customer Out of Scope issues* Mini Projects for Customers* Assistance on other team projects such as Architectural reviews
Internal Projects
* ServiceNow Development* Departmental improvements such as developing new methods to spin up clusters* Developing new methods to clean up our cluster
Cross-Departmental
* Improving testing structure for Release Team* BOB restructuring with Engineering and Product

### What is the goal
* Allow Managers to see and track project involvement and time spent.* Allow TSEs to see what projects they are working on and progress on projects and deadlines from a single location.* A low-cost method to track and close projects once completed.* It must NOT be a burden on TSEs to update. Ideal it to show their amount of "busyness."
### Using Templates/Turning on the Templates bar
We have created some templates to help facilitate a faster case creation. To access them
* Click on the Ellipses at the top bar* Select Toggle Template bar* Templates are listed at the bottom of the Browser.

### What to record
* It is suggested to track significant interactions, but since these are internal notes in case someone else needs to pick back up the exchange, they do not have to be "customer facing"* Please note that new issues ***Absolutely*** must be in new cases. Part of the effort is to track Support Efforts for these situations, and have a correct record of projects or OSS PreSales customer interactions* Recommended to link to any important or relevant documentation
