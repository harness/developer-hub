title: How to Add Additional Users to an Organization
---

## Introduction
Customers may want to invite additional users to deploy in their environment(s).  In order to do so, they will need to first complete their [initial registration](https://docs.armory.io/cd-as-a-service/setup/get-started/#how-to-get-started-using-armory-cd-as-a-service).  It is recommended that customer consider completing an initial set up before adding additional users

## Prerequisites
One person from the team should initiate the [registration for an account](https://docs.armory.io/cd-as-a-service/setup/get-started/#how-to-get-started-using-armory-cd-as-a-service).  Once they have done so, they will be able to add all additional users to the cloud account for the environment(s).
 

## Instructions
Once one user has registered, then navigate to the 'Users' section of the configuration tab, and 'invite' other users to their organization.
* Sign in to the [Armory Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.armory.io/)
* Click on configuration in the top header -> Under Access Management in the left Navigation, click on Users -> Click on Invite Users in the Upper Right corner
* A screen will pop open asking to fill in the ```Name``` and ```Email``` fields for the person that you are inviting
* The person invited will receive an email invitation.  If they do not receive the invite, we suggest that the user should check their ```spam/junk folders```, for the missing email.  
* The new user will then need to follow up the sign up instructions to gain access to the same environment
 
Note: It is recommended that customers from the same organization plan their structure carefully.  Armory cannot merge two organizations together once they are separated.  For example, if two teams within the same organization sign up for two separate CDaaS organization accounts, they ***will not be able to merge the organizations at a later date.*** They would have to in effect, delete one organization and add the existing environments and users to the remaining organization.  

Note 2: Armory cannot manage the users within a CDaaS account without expressed written confirmation and consent from the organization in question. This may result in a  confirmation from our employees by phone or Zoom call.
