### How do I use git based data-sources in a scorecard to evaluate a repository/file that is not present in the source-location path?
Users can use the additional annotation `harnessData` in their `catalog-info.yaml` and add the `path` that they want to evaluate in relative to the source-location of the software component which can further be used as an [input variable](https://developer.harness.io/docs/internal-developer-portal/scorecards/checks-datasources#support-for-catalog-infoyaml-metadata-as-inputs). for eg., if the source location mentioned is `https://github.com/harness/developer-hub` and the `path` added is `/src/service-name/file-name.extenstion`(adding the leading slash `/src` is required) then the final path would be `https://github.com/harness/developer-hub/src/service-name/file-name.extenstion`.  

### Can I use `.md` files as a doc?
Yes we support markdown files in docs, but only if they are present in `mkdocs` format with a `mkdocs.yaml` present in the directory. 

### I have registered a new template but it doesn't show up on my workflows page.
It usually takes 3-5 minutes for IDP to process the entity before it's available to use in the workflows. You can check about failed or processing entities using the devtools plugin. 

### Failed to register Software Components

If, after registering an entity, your're unable to find the same in your catalog, check the Devtools Plugin for Unprocessed Entities. If it's under the **Pending** tab, wait a few minutes for registration to complete. If it's under the **Failed** tab. try re-registering the entity.
