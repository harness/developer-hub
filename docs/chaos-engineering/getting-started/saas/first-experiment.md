In this tutorial, you will apply chaos on a sample boutique application on Kubernetes.

## Before you begin

* [What is chaos engineering?](/docs/chaos-engineering/concepts/chaos101)

## Step 1: Create a project

1. Create a new project or ask your administrator to add you to an existing project. Once you sign up or log in to your account, you can access the **Chaos** tab on the extreme left, which displays the recent experiments that were executed.

    ![HCE Overview](./static/first-chaos/hce-overview.png)

### Step 2: Create an environment

2. A chaos experiment is executed in a chaos infrastructure that is associated with an **environment**. To create a new environment, navigate to the **Environments** page, and choose a **New Environment**. Specify the environment name, a description (optional), and tags (optional). Select the environment type, **Production** or **Non-Production**. Finally, select **Create** to add the new environment.

    ![Create New Environment](./static/first-chaos/create-new-environment.png)

:::tip
You can also select one of the environments from the list of environments if it is available instead of creating an environment.
:::

### Step 3: Create an infrastructure

3. Once you have created an environment, you can add chaos infrastructure to it. Depending on your application, you can select **Kubernetes**, **Linux** or **Windows**. In this tutorial, you can select a Kubernetes infrastructure, which you will use to inject faults into Kubernetes resources. You can use an existing infrastructure or create a new one. In this tutorial, you can create a new infrastructure. For this, select **Enable chaos**.

    ![New Chaos Infrastructure](./static/first-chaos/new-chaos-infrastructure.png)

4. This will lead you to a page where you can select an existing infrastructure or create a new infrastructure. Select **On New Infrastructures** and select **Continue**.

    ![enable Chaos](./static/first-chaos/enable-chaos.png)

5. Provide a name, a description (optional), and tags (optional) for your chaos infrastructure. Click **Next**.

    ![provide name](./static/first-chaos/provide-name.png)

6. In this step, choose the **installation type** as **Kubernetes**, **access type** as **Specific namespace access** (click **Change** to display the **Specific namespace access** access type), **namespace** as **hce**, and **service account name** as **hce**. Select **Next**.

    ![Configure Chaos Infrastructure](./static/first-chaos/configure-chaos-infrastructure.png)

:::tip
The **Cluster-wide access** installation mode allows you to target resources across all the namespaces in your cluster whereas the **Specific namespace access** mode restricts chaos injection to only the namespace in which the delegate is installed.
:::

7. Ensure you have access to your Kubernetes cluster via [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/). Select **Download** to deploy your chaos infrastructure by downloading and applying the given manifest using your terminal. Once done, choose **Done**.

    ![Deploy Chaos Infrastructure](./static/first-chaos/deploy-chaos-infrastructure.png)

8. It may take some time for the delegate to be set up in the Kubernetes cluster. Navigate to **Environments** and once the delegate is ready, the connection status displays as `CONNECTED`.

    ![Infrastructure State](./static/first-chaos/infrastructure-state.png)

### Step 4: Create a demo application and observability infrastructure

Once you are all ready to target our Kubernetes resources, you can execute the simplest fault, [**Pod Delete**](/docs/chaos-engineering/use-harness-ce/chaos-faults/kubernetes/pod/pod-delete). The "pod delete" chaos fault deletes the pods of a deployment, StatefulSet, DaemonSet, etc, to validate the resiliency of a microservice application.

9. You can use your application as a target, however, in this tutorial, use the [Online Boutique](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo) microservices demo application as the target.

10. Before you set up the chaos experiment, install the target application. Run the following commands to set the target application microservices and observability infrastructure (optional), including Grafana, Prometheus, and a BlackBox exporter. Installing the observability infrastructure (optional) provides a dashboard that helps validate the health of the constituent application microservices in real-time.

```bash
❯ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chaosnative/harness-chaos-demo/main/boutique-app-manifests/manifest/app.yaml -n hce
```

```bash
❯ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chaosnative/harness-chaos-demo/main/boutique-app-manifests/manifest/monitoring.yaml -n hce
```

:::info
* Earlier, you specified the installation mode as **Specific namespace access**, hence the resources are deployed in the `hce` namespace.
* The target application and observability infrastructure pods are available in the `hce` namespace
:::

11. To view the pods in the `hce` namespace, execute the command below:

    ```
    ❯ kubectl get pods -n hce

    ```

12. To list the services available in the `hce` namespace, execute the command below:

    ```
    ❯ kubectl get services -n hce

    NAME                           TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE

    ```

13. To access the frontend of the target application in your browser, use the `frontend-external` LoadBalancer service.

    ![Online Boutique](./static/first-chaos/online-boutique.png)

14. Similarly, you can access the Grafana dashboard. Login with the default credentials, that is, username `admin` and password `admin`, and browse the Online Boutique application dashboard. Currently, all the metrics indicate normal application behavior.

    ![Grafana App Dashboard](./static/first-chaos/grafana-app-dashboard.png)

### Step 5: Construct a chaos experiment

Since the target application has been deployed, you can now create a chaos experiment. You will target the pods of the `carts` microservice with the **pod delete** fault. Currently, the cart page is healthy and accessible from the front end, as seen in the `/cart` route.

    ![Online Boutique App Cart](./static/first-chaos/online-boutique-app-cart.png)

15. To create a chaos experiment, go to **Chaos Experiments** page and select **New Experiment**.

    ![create new experiment](./static/first-chaos/create-new-experiment-1.png)

16. Specify the experiment name and a description (optional) and tags (optional). Choose the target infrastructure that you created earlier, click **Apply**, and click **Next**.

    ![specify parameters](./static/first-chaos/specify-params-2.png)

17. In the Experiment Builder, choose **Templates from Chaos Hubs** and select **Boutique cart delete**. This allows you to create a chaos experiment using a pre-defined template that already has a pod delete chaos fault configured to target the online boutique application. Select **Use this template** to continue.

    ![Boutique Cart Delete Template](./static/first-chaos/boutique-cart-delete-template.png)

18. Your target is the `carts` microservice. Hence the appropriate `hce` application namespace and the `app=cartservice` application label have been provided here. Also, the application kind is `deployment`. You can discover these entities from within the UI using the search dropdown menu for the respective inputs.

    ![Target Application Config](./static/first-chaos/target-application-config.png)

19. Choose the **Tune Fault** tab to view the fault parameters. Here, you can tune the fault parameters. Set **Total Chaos Duration** to 30, **Chaos Interval** to 10, and **Force** to `false`. You can leave the **Pods affected perc** empty for now. The values for `Total Chaos Duration` and `Chaos Interval` indicate that for every value of 10 seconds, the cart microservice pod(s) are deleted for a total of 30 seconds. By default, at least one pod of the cart deployment is targeted.

    ![Tune Fault Config](./static/first-chaos/tune-fault-config.png)

20. Navigate to the **Probes** tab. Here, you can either create a probe or select a pre-defined probe. Click **Select or Add new probes**. In this tutorial, you can create a probe. Select **+New Probe**, select **HTTP** and enter the following details in the respective fields:

    ```
    name: "http-cartservice"
    probeTimeout: "10s"
    interval: "5s"
    attempt: 2
    probePollingInterval: "1s"
    url: "http://service-of-the-user.namespace.svc.cluster-domain.example"
    method: GET
    Select "Compare Response Code"
    criteria: "=="
    responseCode: 200
    ```

    ![Probes Config](./static/first-chaos/probes-config.png)

:::tip
- You can given any name and ensure you use the same when referencing or using the probe in other places.
- You can provide your own URL in the `url` field. The format is provided in the above example. For example, if your application targets the "cart-service", your `url` would be `http://cartservice.hce.svc.cluster.local/cart`.
- Go to [create a probe](/docs/chaos-engineering/use-harness-ce/probes/use-probe) to understand the steps in detail.
:::

21. Once you create the probe, it will be listed in the probe listing section on the left side of the page, as shown below. Select the probe to view the probe details. Click **Add to Fault**.

    ![Probes Config 4](./static/first-chaos/probes-config-4.png)

:::info note
Under probe details, you can see that the URL is `http://cartservice.hce.svc.cluster.local/cart` and the interval is 5s. As a part of the probe execution, `GET` requests are made to the specified URL. If no HTTP response is found within 5s, the probe status is considered as 'failed'. If all the probe executions pass, then the probe status is considered as 'passed'. You can find other probe details in the properties field.
:::

22. Select mode as **Continuous**. Click **Apply changes**.

    ![Probes Config 5](./static/first-chaos/continuous-mode.png)

23. This will close the probes tab, and now, you can click **Apply changes** to apply the configuration to the chaos experiment.

    ![Probes Config 6](./static/first-chaos/apply-changes.png)

### Step 6: Observing chaos execution

24. To execute the chaos experiment, click **Save**, and then **Run**.

    ![Run and save](./static/first-chaos/run-n-save.png)

25. You can see that once you click **Run**, an experiment run is scheduled. You can see the status of every step in the tab.

    ![Exp running](./static/first-chaos/exp-running.png)

26. Select **Recent experiment runs** to view the runs of an experiment. The latest experiment is displayed in the last bar with the status as `RUNNING`.

    ![Exp status](./static/first-chaos/exp-status.png)

27. To check the status of the cart deployment pod, execute the command below. The pod delete fault terminates the cart pod and replaces it with a new pod, for which a container is yet to be created.

    ```
    ❯ kubectl get pods -n hce

    NAME                                           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS       AGE

    ```

28. As a consequence, if you try to access the frontend cart page, you will encounter the following error which indicates that the application is now unreachable.

    ![Webpage Unavailable](./static/first-chaos/webpage-unavailable.png)

29. You can validate this behavior using the application metrics dashboard too. The probe success percentage for website availability (200 response code) decreases steeply along with the 99th percentile (green line) queries per second (QPS) and access duration for the application microservices. Also, the mean QPS (yellow line) steeply increases. This is because no pod is available at the moment to service the query requests.

    ![Application Down Dashboard](./static/first-chaos/application-down-dashboard.png)

### Step 7: Evaluate the experiment run

30. When the experiment execution concludes, you get a resilience score of 0 %. You will observe that the pod delete fault step failed. Before analyzing the experiment result, you can validate that the application is now again accessible, without any errors. You can validate this from the Grafana dashboard metrics that indicate the app returning to normal as the chaos duration is over.

    ![App Metrics Normalizing](./static/first-chaos/app-metrics-normalizing.png)

31. You can check the chaos result that shows the pod delete as **Failed**. This is because the 'http-cart-service' probe failed. The failure is due to the unavailability of the cart pod and therefore the `/cart` endpoint, due to injecting the "pod delete" fault.

    ![Experiment Failed Probe](./static/first-chaos/pod-delete-fail.png)

:::info note
You can see that the value expected and the value obtained don't match. Hence, the probe fails.

## Conclusion

Congratulations on running your first chaos experiment! Want to know how to remediate the application so as to pass the experiment run and probe checks? Increase the experiment pods to at least two so that at least one deployment pod survives the pod delete fault and helps the application stay afloat. Try running it on your own!

Here are some recommendations:
