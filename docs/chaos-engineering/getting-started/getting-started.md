Before you begin, review the following:

- [All about chaos engineering](/docs/chaos-engineering/concepts/chaos101)
- [Explore features](/docs/chaos-engineering/concepts/explore-features)

Harness CE is available in two ways:
1. SaaS (Software-as-a-Service)
2. SMP (Self-Managed Platform)

:::tip
Feature availability on HCE SaaS and SMP are on par, with minor timeline changes in the SMP feature releases.

## SaaS
HCE module is provided as service that you can use by either signing up or getting invited to a specific project. HCE provides you the assistance required to manage the cluster.
You can also create a project if you have the necessary permissions.
The control plane (set of microservices that help the domain function) is hosted by [Harness](https://app.harness.io).
For more information on how to use SaaS, go to [SaaS documentation](/docs/chaos-engineering/getting-started/saas/).

## SMP
You will need to create, manage and maintain your clusters. You will be responsible for providing permissions to projects and handling the issues associated with them.
The control plane is hosted within your domain, for example, `harness.your-domain.io`.
Contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io) and [SMP documentation](/docs/chaos-engineering/getting-started/smp/) for more information.

## Onboarding

If you want to get hands-on experience by executing chaos experiments without explicitly fulfilling the prerequisites, [automated](/docs/chaos-engineering/getting-started/onboarding/automated-onboarding) or [guided onboarding](/docs/chaos-engineering/getting-started/onboarding/guided-onboarding) is for you. Go to [Introduction to Onboarding](/docs/chaos-engineering/getting-started/onboarding/) to know more.
