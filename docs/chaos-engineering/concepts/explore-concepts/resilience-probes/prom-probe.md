import CommonNote from './shared/common-note.md'

The Prometheus probe allows users to run Prometheus queries and match the resulting output against specific conditions. The intent behind this probe is to allow users to define metrics-based SLOs in a declarative way and determine the experiment verdict based on their success. The probe runs the query on a Prometheus server defined by the endpoint and checks whether the output satisfies the specified criteria. The outcome of a PromQL query (that is provided) is used for probe validation.

:::info YAML only feature
In case of complex queries that span multiple lines, the `queryPath` attribute can be used to provide the link to a file consisting of the query. This file can be made available in the experiment pod via a ConfigMap resource, with the ConfigMap being passed in the [ChaosEngine](https://litmuschaos.github.io/litmus/experiments/concepts/chaos-resources/chaos-engine/contents/) or the [ChaosExperiment](https://litmuschaos.github.io/litmus/experiments/concepts/chaos-resources/chaos-experiment/contents/) CR. Also, `query` and `queryPath` attributes are mutually exclusive. Refer to the probe schema [here](https://docs.litmuschaos.io/docs/concepts/probes#promprobe).
:::

## Probe definition

You can define the probes at **.spec.experiments[].spec.probe** path inside the chaos engine.

```yaml
kind: Workflow
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
spec:
  templates:
    - inputs:
        artifacts:
          - raw:
              data: |
                apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
                kind: ChaosEngine
                spec:
                  experiments:
                    - spec:
                        probe:
                          ####################################
                          Probes are defined here
                          ####################################
```

:::tip
The Prometheus probe expects you to provide a PromQL query along with Prometheus service endpoints to check for specific criteria.

### Authentication

This establishes a fundamental authentication mechanism for the Prometheus server. The "username:password", encoded in base64, should be placed either within the `credentials` field or as a file path in the `credentialsFile` field.

:::tip
The `credentials` and `credentialsFile` are two options that can't be used simultaneously.
:::

These secret resources contain either the username:password encoded in base64 format or a bearer token, depending on the authentication type </td>
  </tr>
</table>

### TLS

It offers a mechanism to validate TLS certifications for the Prometheus server. You can supply the `cacert` or the client certificate and client key to perform the validation.
Alternatively, you have the option to enable the `insecureSkipVerify` check to bypass certificate validation.

<CommonNote />

```yaml
probe:
  - name: "check-probe-success"
    type: "promProbe"
    promProbe/inputs:
      endpoint: "prometheus-server.prometheus.svc.cluster.local:9090"
      query: "sum(rate(http_requests_total{code=~\"2..\"}[1m])) by (job)"

        credentials: "base64(<username:password>)"
      tlsConfig:
        insecureSkipVerify: true

```


### Prometheus query (simple query)

This section holds the PromQL query used to extract the desired Prometheus metrics by executing it on the specified Prometheus endpoint. You can input the Prometheus query in the 'query' field, and this can be initiated by configuring the `.promProbe/inputs.query` field.

Use the following example to tune this:

```yaml
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  appinfo:
    appns: "default"
    applabel: "app=nginx"
    appkind: "deployment"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: pod-delete
    spec:
      probe:
      - name: "check-probe-success"
        type: "promProbe"
        promProbe/inputs:
          # endpoint for the promethus service
          endpoint: "prometheus-server.prometheus.svc.cluster.local:9090"
          # promql query, which should be executed
          query: "sum(rate(http_requests_total{code=~\"2..\"}[1m])) by (job)"
          comparator:
            # criteria which should be followed by the actual output and the expected output
            #supports >=,<=,>,<,==,!= comparision
            criteria: ">" 
            # expected value, which should follow the specified criteria
            value: "0"
        mode: "Edge"
        runProperties:
          probeTimeout: 5s
          interval: 2s
          attempt: 1
```

### Prometheus query (complex query)

For intricate queries that extend across multiple lines, you can use the 'queryPath' attribute to specify the path to a file containing the query. This file can be accessed by the experiment pod through a ConfigMap resource, with the ConfigMap name defined in either the ChaosEngine or the ChaosExperiment CR. To set this up, configure the `promProbe/inputs.queryPath` field.

:::tip
The fields `queryPath` and `query` are mutually exclusive. If `query` is specified, it is used for the query; otherwise, `queryPath` is used.
:::

Use the following example to tune this:

```yaml
# contains the prom probe which execute the query and match for the expected criteria
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  appinfo:
    appns: "default"
    applabel: "app=nginx"
    appkind: "deployment"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: pod-delete
    spec:
      probe:
      - name: "check-probe-success"
        type: "promProbe"
        promProbe/inputs:
          # endpoint for the promethus service
          endpoint: "prometheus-server.prometheus.svc.cluster.local:9090"
          # the configMap should be mounted to the experiment which contains promql query
          # use the mounted path here
          queryPath: "/etc/config/prometheus-query"
          comparator:
            # criteria which should be followed by the actual output and the expected output
            #supports >=,<=,>,<,==,!= comparision
            criteria: ">" 
            # expected value, which should follow the specified criteria
            value: "0"
        mode: "Edge"
        runProperties:
          probeTimeout: 5s
          interval: 2s
          attempt: 1
```

### Authentication

This establishes a fundamental authentication mechanism for the Prometheus server. The "username:password" encoded in base64 or bearer token, should be placed either within the `credentials` field or as a file path in the `credentialsFile` field.

:::tip
The `credentials` and `credentialsFile` are mutually exclusive, that is, these fields can't be used simultaneously.
:::

Use the following example to tune this:

```yaml
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  appinfo:
    appns: "default"
    applabel: "app=nginx"
    appkind: "deployment"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: pod-delete
    spec:
      probe:
      - name: "check-probe-success"
        type: "promProbe"
        promProbe/inputs:
          # endpoint for the promethus service
          endpoint: "prometheus-server.prometheus.svc.cluster.local:9090"
          # promql query, which should be executed
          query: "sum(rate(http_requests_total{code=~\"2..\"}[1m])) by (job)"
          comparator:
            # criteria which should be followed by the actual output and the expected output
            #supports >=,<=,>,<,==,!= comparison
            criteria: ">"
            # expected value, which should follow the specified criteria
            value: "0"
          auth:
            type: Basic
            credentials: "base64(<username:password>)"
        mode: "Edge"
        runProperties:
          probeTimeout: 5s
          interval: 2s
          attempt: 1
```

### TLS with custom certificates

It offers a mechanism to validate TLS certifications for the Prometheus server. You can supply the `cacert` or the client certificate and client key to perform the validation.

:::tip
The CA certificate file must be incorporated into the experiment pod either as a configMap or a secret. The volume name (configMap or secret) and mountPath should be specified within the chaosengine at the `spec.components.secrets` path.
:::

Use the following example to tune this:

```yaml
# contains the prom probe which execute the query and match for the expected criteria
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  appinfo:
    appns: "default"
    applabel: "app=nginx"
    appkind: "deployment"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: pod-delete
    spec:
      components:
        secrets:
          - name: ca-cert
            mountPath: /etc/config
      probe:
      - name: "check-probe-success"
        type: "promProbe"
        promProbe/inputs:
          # endpoint for the promethus service
          endpoint: "https://prometheus-server.harness.io"
          # promql query, which should be executed
          query: "sum(rate(http_requests_total{code=~\"2..\"}[1m])) by (job)"
          comparator:
            # criteria which should be followed by the actual output and the expected output
            #supports >=,<=,>,<,==,!= comparision
            criteria: ">" 
            # expected value, which should follow the specified criteria
            value: "0"
          tlsConfig:
            caFile: "/etc/config/ca.crt"
        mode: "Edge"
        runProperties:
          probeTimeout: 5s
          interval: 2s
          attempt: 1
```

### TLS skip certificate verification

You can bypass the TLS certificate checks by enabling the `insecureSkipVerify` option.

Use the following example to tune this:

```yaml
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  appinfo:
    appns: "default"
    applabel: "app=nginx"
    appkind: "deployment"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: pod-delete
    spec:
      probe:
      - name: "check-probe-success"
        type: "promProbe"
        promProbe/inputs:
          # endpoint for the promethus service
          endpoint: "https://prometheus-server.harness.io"
          # promql query, which should be executed
          query: "sum(rate(http_requests_total{code=~\"2..\"}[1m])) by (job)"
          comparator:
            # criteria which should be followed by the actual output and the expected output
            #supports >=,<=,>,<,==,!= comparision
            criteria: ">"
            # expected value, which should follow the specified criteria
            value: "0"
          tlsConfig:
            insecureSkipVerify: true
        mode: "Edge"
        runProperties:
          probeTimeout: 5s
          interval: 2s
          attempt: 1
```
