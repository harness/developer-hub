import CommonNote from './shared/common-note.md'

HTTP probe allows you to specify a URL that the experiment uses to determine the health or service availability (or other custom conditions) that is a part of the entry or exit criteria. The status code received is mapped against an expected status. It supports HTTP [GET](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/GET) and [POST](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST) methods.

The HTTP GET method sends a GET request to the specified URL. The response received is matched for the response code or response body based on the provided criteria.

HTTP POST method sends a `POST` request to the provided URL.

:::info YAML only feature
In the case of a complex `POST` request in which the body spans multiple lines, the `bodyPath` attribute is used to specify the path to a file consisting of the same. This file is available to the experiment pod through a ConfigMap resource, wherein the ConfigMap name is defined in the [chaos engine](https://litmuschaos.github.io/litmus/experiments/concepts/chaos-resources/chaos-engine/contents/) or the [chaos experiment](https://litmuschaos.github.io/litmus/experiments/concepts/chaos-resources/chaos-experiment/contents/) CR. The `body` and `bodyPath` attributes are mutually exclusive. Go to [probe schema](https://docs.litmuschaos.io/docs/concepts/probes#httpprobe) to learn more.

## Probe definition

You can define the probes at **.spec.experiments[].spec.probe** path inside the chaos engine.

```yaml
kind: Workflow
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
spec:
  templates:
    - inputs:
        artifacts:
          - raw:
              data: |
                apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
                kind: ChaosEngine
                spec:
                  experiments:
                    - spec:
                        probe:

### Authentication

This establishes a fundamental authentication mechanism for the http endpoint. The username:password, encoded in base64 or bearer token should be placed either within the `credentials` field or as a file path in the `credentialsFile` field.
It's important to note that `credentials` and `credentialsFile` are two options that cannot be used simultaneously.

<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Field</strong> </td>

These secret resources contain either the username:password encoded in base64 format or a bearer token, depending on the authentication type </td>
  </tr>
</table>

### TLS

It offers the mechanism to validate TLS certifications for the HTTP endpoint. You can supply the `cacert` or the client certificate and client key, to perform the validation.
Alternatively, you have the option to enable the `insecureSkipVerify` check to bypass certificate validation.

<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Field</strong> </td>
   <td><strong>Description</strong> </td>
   <td><strong>Type</strong> </td>
   <td><strong>Range</strong> </td>
   <td><strong>Notes</strong> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>caFile </td>
   <td>Flag to hold the ca file path </td>
   <td>Optional </td>

  <tr>
   <td>insecureSkipVerify </td>
   <td>Flag to skip the tls certificates checks </td>
   <td>Optional </td>
   <td><code>boolean</code> </td>
   <td>The <code>insecureSkipVerify</code> skip the tls certificates checks </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Definition

<CommonNote />

```yaml
probe:
  - name: "check-frontend-access-url"
    type: "httpProbe"
    httpProbe/inputs:
      url: "https://google.com"
      tlsConfig:
        insecureSkipVerify: true
      method:
        get:
          criteria: == # <, >, <=, >=, ==, !=, oneof, between operations
          responseCode: "200"
    mode: "Continuous"
    runProperties:
      probeTimeout: 5s
      interval: 2s
      attempt: 1
      probePollingInterval: 2s
```


### HTTP GET request (validate response code)

The HTTP GET method involves sending an HTTP GET request to the provided URL and then assessing the response code against specified criteria (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`, `oneof`, `between`). This can be accomplished by configuring the `httpProbe/inputs.method.get` field.

Use the following example to tune this:

```yaml
# contains the http probes with get method and verify the response code
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  appinfo:
    appns: "default"
    applabel: "app=nginx"
    appkind: "deployment"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: pod-delete
    spec:
      probe:
      - name: "check-frontend-access-url"
        type: "httpProbe"
        httpProbe/inputs:
          url: "frontend-service.default.svc.cluster.local"
          method:
            # call http get method and verify the response code
            get:
              # criteria which should be matched
              criteria: == # <, >, <=, >=, ==, !=, oneof, between
              # expected response code for the http request, which should follow the specified criteria
              responseCode: "200"
        mode: "Continuous"
        runProperties:
          probeTimeout: 5s
          interval: 2s
          attempt: 1
          probePollingInterval: 2s
```

### HTTP GET request (validate response body)

The HTTP GET method involves sending an HTTP GET request to the provided URL and then assessing the response body against specified criteria (`contains`, `equal`, `notEqual`, `matches`, `notMatches`, `oneof`). This can be accomplished by configuring the `httpProbe/inputs.method.get` field.

Use the following example to tune this:

```yaml
# contains the http probes with get method and verify the response body
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  appinfo:
    appns: "default"
    applabel: "app=nginx"
    appkind: "deployment"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: pod-delete
    spec:
      probe:
      - name: "check-frontend-access-url"
        type: "httpProbe"
        httpProbe/inputs:
          url: "http://frontend-service.default.svc.cluster.local"
          method:
            # call http get method and verify the response code
            get:
              # criteria which should be matched
              criteria: contains
              # expected response body for the http request, which should follow the specified criteria
              responseBody: "hello world"
        mode: "Continuous"
        runProperties:
          probeTimeout: 5s
          interval: 2s
          attempt: 1
          probePollingInterval: 2s
```

### HTTP POST request (validate response code)

This section holds the HTTP body necessary for making an HTTP POST request and then assessing the response code against specified criteria, particularly for simple requests. The HTTP body content can be supplied in the 'body' field, and this can be initiated by configuring the `httpProbe/inputs.method.post.body` field.

Use the following example to tune this:

```yaml
# contains the http probes with post method and verify the response code
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  appinfo:
    appns: "default"
    applabel: "app=nginx"
    appkind: "deployment"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: pod-delete
    spec:
      probe:
      - name: "send-data-to-backend"
        type: "httpProbe"
        httpProbe/inputs:
          url: "backend.default.svc.cluster.local"
          method:
            # call http post method and verify the response code
            post:
              # value of the http body, used for the post request
              body: "{\"name\":\"foo\",\"description\":\"bar\"}"
              # http body content type
              contentType: "application/json; charset=UTF-8"
              # criteria which should be matched
              criteria: "==" # <, >, >=, <=, ==, !=, oneof, between
              # expected response code for the http request, which should follow the specified criteria
              responseCode: "200"
        mode: "Continuous"
        runProperties:
          probeTimeout: 5s
          interval: 2s
          attempt: 1
          probePollingInterval: 2s
```

### HTTP POST request (validate response body)

This section holds the HTTP body necessary for making an HTTP POST request and then assessing the response body against specified criteria, particularly for simple requests. The HTTP body content can be supplied in the 'body' field, and this can be initiated by configuring the `httpProbe/inputs.method.post.body` field.

  experiments:
  - name: pod-delete
    spec:
      probe:
      - name: "send-data-to-backend"
        type: "httpProbe"
        httpProbe/inputs:
          url: "backend.default.svc.cluster.local"
          method:
            # call http post method and verify the response code
            post:
              # value of the http body, used for the post request
              body: "{\"name\":\"foo\",\"description\":\"bar\"}"
              # http body content type
              contentType: "application/json; charset=UTF-8"
              # criteria which should be matched
              criteria: contains
              # expected response body for the http request, which should follow the specified criteria
              responseBody: "ok"
        mode: "Continuous"
        runProperties:
          probeTimeout: 5s
          interval: 2s
          attempt: 1
          probePollingInterval: 2s
```

### HTTP POST request (complex HTTP body)

For complex POST requests with multi-line bodies, the 'bodyPath' attribute comes into play. It allows you to specify the path to a file containing the required body content. This file can be accessed by the experiment pod through a ConfigMap resource, with the ConfigMap name defined in either the ChaosEngine or the ChaosExperiment CR. To set this up, configure the `httpProbe/inputs.method.post.body` field.

Please note that it is mutually exclusive with the `body` field. If `body` is specified, it will be used for the POST request; otherwise, `bodyPath` will be used.

Use the following example to tune this:

```yaml
# contains the http probes with post method and verify the response code
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  appinfo:
    appns: "default"
    applabel: "app=nginx"
    appkind: "deployment"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: pod-delete
    spec:
      probe:
      - name: "send-data-to-backend"
        type: "httpProbe"
        httpProbe/inputs:
          url: "backend.default.svc.cluster.local"
          method:
            # call http post method and verify the response code
            post:
              # the configMap should be mounted to the experiment which contains http body
              # use the mounted path here
              bodyPath: "/mnt/body.yml"
              # http body content type
              contentType: "application/json; charset=UTF-8"
              # criteria which should be matched
              criteria: "==" # <, >, >=, <=, ==, !=, oneof, between
              # expected response code for the http request, which should follow the specified criteria
              responseCode: "200"
        mode: "Continuous"
        runProperties:
          probeTimeout: 5s
          interval: 2s
          attempt: 1
          probePollingInterval: 2s
```

### Authentication

This establishes a fundamental authentication mechanism for the HTTP endpoint. The `username:password` encoded in base64 or bearer token should be placed either within the `credentials` field or as a file path in the `credentialsFile` field.

              # expected response code for the http request, which should follow the specified criteria
              responseCode: "200"
        mode: "Continuous"
        runProperties:
          probeTimeout: 5s
          interval: 2s
          attempt: 1
          probePollingInterval: 2s
```

### Headers

Headers for HTTP requests can be specified in a map format within the `headers` path.

Use the following example to tune this:

```yaml
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  appinfo:
    appns: "default"
    applabel: "app=nginx"
    appkind: "deployment"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: pod-delete
    spec:
      probe:
      - name: "send-data-to-backend"
        type: "httpProbe"
        httpProbe/inputs:
          url: "backend.default.svc.cluster.local"
          headers:
            Content-Type: application/json
          auth:
            type: Basic
            credentials: "dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ="
          method:
            # call http post method and verify the response code
            post:
              # the configMap should be mounted to the experiment which contains http body
              # use the mounted path here
              bodyPath: "/mnt/body.yml"
              # http body content type
              contentType: "application/json; charset=UTF-8"
              # criteria which should be matched
              criteria: "==" # ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=, between, oneof
              # expected response code for the http request, which should follow the specified criteria
              responseCode: "200"
        mode: "Continuous"
        runProperties:
          probeTimeout: 5s
          interval: 2s
          attempt: 1
          probePollingInterval: 2s
```

### TLS With custom certificates

It offers the mechanism to validate TLS certifications for the http endpoint. You can supply the cacert or the client certificate and client key, to perform the validation.

:::tip
The CA certificate file must be incorporated into the experiment pod either as a configMap or a secret. The volume name (configMap or secret) and mountPath should be specified within the chaosengine at the `spec.components.secrets` path.
:::

Use the following example to tune this:

```yaml
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  appinfo:
    appns: "default"
    applabel: "app=nginx"
    appkind: "deployment"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: pod-delete
    spec:
      components:
        secrets:
          - name: ca-cert
            mountPath: /mnt
      probe:
      - name: "send-data-to-backend"
        type: "httpProbe"
        httpProbe/inputs:
          url: "backend.default.svc.cluster.local"
          tlsConfig:
            caFile: "/mnt/ca.crt"
          method:
            # call http post method and verify the response code
            post:
              # the configMap should be mounted to the experiment which contains http body
              # use the mounted path here
              bodyPath: "/mnt/body.yml"
              # http body content type
              contentType: "application/json; charset=UTF-8"
              # criteria which should be matched
              criteria: "==" # ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=, between, oneof
              # expected response code for the http request, which should follow the specified criteria
              responseCode: "200"
        mode: "Continuous"
        runProperties:
          probeTimeout: 5s
          interval: 2s
          attempt: 1
          probePollingInterval: 2s
```

### TLS skip certificate verification

You can bypass the tls certificate checks by enabling the `insecureSkipVerify` option.

Use the following example to tune this:

```yaml
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  appinfo:
    appns: "default"
    applabel: "app=nginx"
    appkind: "deployment"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: pod-delete
    spec:
      probe:
      - name: "send-data-to-backend"
        type: "httpProbe"
        httpProbe/inputs:
          url: "backend.default.svc.cluster.local"
          tlsConfig:
            insecureSkipVerify: true
          method:
            # call http post method and verify the response code
            post: 
              # the configMap should be mounted to the experiment which contains http body
              # use the mounted path here
              bodyPath: "/mnt/body.yml"
              # http body content type
              contentType: "application/json; charset=UTF-8"
              # criteria which should be matched
              criteria: "==" # <, >, <=, >=, ==, !=, oneof, between
              # expected response code for the http request, which should follow the specified criteria
              responseCode: "200"
        mode: "Continuous"
        runProperties:
          probeTimeout: 5s
          interval: 2s
          attempt: 1
          probePollingInterval: 2s
```
