# Get Started with Chaos Engineering

Welcome to Chaos Engineering! This section will help you get started with building resilient systems through controlled chaos experiments.

## Overview

Chaos Engineering is the discipline of experimenting on a system to build confidence in the system's capability to withstand turbulent conditions in production.

## Quick Start Steps

1. **Set up your environment** - Configure your Harness account and connect your infrastructure
2. **Create your first experiment** - Design and run a simple chaos experiment
3. **Analyze results** - Review experiment outcomes and system behavior
4. **Scale your practice** - Expand chaos engineering across your organization

## What You'll Learn

- Core chaos engineering principles
- How to design effective experiments
- Best practices for safe chaos testing
- Integration with your existing workflows

## Prerequisites

- Active Harness account
- Basic understanding of your system architecture
- Access to target infrastructure

## Next Steps

Ready to begin? Start with our [Quick Start Guide](../quickstart) to run your first chaos experiment in minutes.
