:::info New Chaos Studio Feature
**Templates** are part of the enhanced **New Chaos Studio** experience. If you're an existing customer and want access to new features, contact your Harness support representative. For more details, see [New Chaos Studio Features](/docs/chaos-engineering#new-chaos-studio-features).
:::


**Templates** are reusable, pre-configured components that help you standardize and accelerate your chaos engineering practices. Templates provide a foundation for creating consistent experiments across your organization while maintaining flexibility for customization.

You can create faults, probes, and actions in two ways:
- **Direct Creation**: Create components directly through their specific sections (Faults, Probes, Actions) for one-time use
- **Template-Based Creation**: Create components from templates when you need reusable, standardized configurations across multiple experiments

Templates allow you to:
- Standardize chaos engineering practices across teams
- Reduce experiment creation time with pre-built components
- Ensure best practices and consistent configurations
- Share proven patterns across projects and environments
- Maintain version control for your chaos engineering assets

## Types of Templates

Harness Chaos supports templates for three core components:

### 1. Fault Templates

**Fault Templates** provide pre-configured chaos faults that can be reused across experiments.

### 2. Probe Templates

**Probe Templates** offer reusable validation and monitoring configurations.

### 3. Action Templates

**Action Templates** provide reusable workflow actions for experiment orchestration.

## Template Scopes

Templates can be managed at different organizational levels:
- **Account Level**: Shared across projects within an account
- **Organization Level**: Available across the entire organization
- **Project Level**: Available within a specific project

## Getting Started with Templates

### Creating Templates

1. Navigate to **ChaosHubs** in your **Project Settings**

    ![chaos hubs](./static/templates/chaos-hub.png)

2. Choose the **ChaosHub** you want to create templates in.

3. Start creating **Faults**, **Probes** or **Actions** templates.

    ![create templates](./static/templates/probe-template.png)

4. Import the templates into your project to make them available for use

    ![import templates](./static/templates/import-template.png)

5. Start using the templates in your experiments

    ![use templates](./static/templates/start-using.png)
