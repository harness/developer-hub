:::info New Chaos Studio Feature
**Experiment-Level Probes** are part of the enhanced **New Chaos Studio** experience. If you're an existing customer and want access to new features, contact your Harness support representative. For more details, see [New Chaos Studio Features](/docs/chaos-engineering#new-chaos-studio-features).

## What are Experiment-Level Probes?

Experiment-level probes are resilience validation checks that operate across the entire chaos experiment lifecycle, rather than being scoped to individual faults. These probes provide:

- **Global Validation**: Monitor system health across all faults in an experiment
- **End-to-End Assessment**: Validate overall system behavior from start to finish
- **Cross-Fault Correlation**: Understand how multiple faults interact and affect system resilience
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Track metrics and health indicators throughout the experiment

Unlike fault-specific probes that validate individual chaos injections, experiment-level probes assess the cumulative impact of all chaos activities within an experiment.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to add experiment-level probes to your chaos experiments:

### Step 1: Create or Open an Experiment

1. Navigate to **Chaos Experiments** in your Harness project
2. Either create a new experiment or open an existing one

### Step 2: Add Experiment-Level Probes

1. In the experiment builder, click on the '+' icon, then click **Add a Probe**.

2. Choose the probe you want to add to the experiment.

3. Configure the probe properties and click **Apply Changes**.

    ![configure probe](./static/experiment-level-probes/configure-probe-properties.png)

### Step 3: Validate and Run

1. Save the experiment with the configured probe
2. **Run** the experiment to see probe results
