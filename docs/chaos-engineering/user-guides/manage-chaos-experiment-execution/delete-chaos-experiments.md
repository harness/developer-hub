Deleting an experiment removes it from the list of experiments in the **Chaos Experiments** sidebar option under Chaos tab.
- Deleting an initialized or completed experiment will permanently remove the experiment.
- Deleting a running experiment will not only remove the experiment permanently but also immediately stop the experiment execution.
- Deleting an experiment doesn't remove any template which has been created using that experiment.

To delete any experiment, simply go to the **Chaos Experiments** sidebar option, select the **`⋮`** icon against the experiment, and select **Delete Experiment**.
