# Chaos Faults

Chaos faults are the core building blocks of chaos experiments. They simulate various failure scenarios to test the resilience of your applications and infrastructure.

## Available Fault Categories

### [Chaos Faults](./chaos-faults)
Browse our comprehensive collection of pre-built chaos faults for various platforms and services.

### [Custom Faults](./custom-faults)
Create and manage your own custom chaos faults using BYOC (Bring Your Own Chaos) capabilities.

## Getting Started

1. **Explore Available Faults**: Browse the [chaos faults](./chaos-faults) to see what's available
2. **Understand Fault Tunables**: Learn about [common tunables](./chaos-faults/common-tunables-for-all-faults) that apply to all faults
3. **Create Custom Faults**: Use [BYOC](./byoc) to create your own fault types
