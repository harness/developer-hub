ECS container HTTP reset peer injects HTTP reset on the service whose port is specified using the `TARGET_SERVICE_PORT` environment variable.
- It stops the outgoing HTTP requests by resetting the TCP connection for the requests.
- It determines the application's resilience to a lossy (or flaky) HTTP connection.
- This experiment induces chaos within a container and depends on an EC2 instance. Typically, these are prefixed with ["ECS container"](/docs/chaos-engineering/faults/chaos-faults/aws/ec2-and-serverless-faults#ec2-backed-faults) and involve direct interaction with the EC2 instances hosting the ECS containers.

## Use cases
ECS container HTTP reset peer:
- Simulates premature connection loss (firewall issues or other issues) between microservices (verify connection timeout).
- Simulates connection resets due to resource limitations on the server side like out of memory server (or process killed or overload on the server due to a high amount of traffic).

### Prerequisites
- Kubernetes >= 1.17
- ECS container metadata is enabled (disabled by default). To enable it, go to [container metadata](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/container-metadata.html). If your task is currently running, you may need to restart it to get the metadata directory.
- ECS cluster running with the desired tasks and containers and familiarity with ECS service update and deployment concepts.
- Access to the ECS cluster instances with the necessary permissions to update the start and stop timeouts for containers. Refer to [systems manager docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/setup-launch-managed-instance.html).
- Backup and recovery mechanisms in place to handle potential failures during the testing process.
- You and the ECS cluster instances have a role with the required AWS access to perform the SSM and ECS operations.
- Kubernetes secret with AWS Access Key ID and secret access key credentials in the `CHAOS_NAMESPACE`. Below is the sample secret file:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: cloud-secret
type: Opaque
stringData:
  cloud_config.yml: |-
    # Add the cloud AWS credentials respectively
    [default]
    aws_access_key_id = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    aws_secret_access_key = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

:::tip
HCE recommends that you use the same secret name, that is, `cloud-secret`. Otherwise, you will need to update the `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` environment variable in the fault template with the new secret name and you won't be able to use the default health check probes.

Below is an example AWS policy to execute the fault.

                "ec2messages:FailMessage",
                "ec2messages:GetEndpoint",
                "ec2messages:GetMessages",
                "ec2messages:SendReply"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:DescribeInstanceStatus",
                "ec2:DescribeInstances"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

:::info note
- You can pass the VM credentials as secrets or as a `ChaosEngine` environment variable.
- The ECS container should be in a healthy state before and after introducing chaos.
- Refer to the [superset permission or policy](/docs/chaos-engineering/faults/chaos-faults/aws/security-configurations/policy-for-all-aws-faults) to execute all AWS faults.
- Refer to the [common attributes](/docs/chaos-engineering/faults/chaos-faults/common-tunables-for-all-faults) to tune the common tunables for all the faults.
- Refer to [AWS named profile for chaos](/docs/chaos-engineering/faults/chaos-faults/aws/security-configurations/aws-switch-profile) to use a different profile for AWS faults.
