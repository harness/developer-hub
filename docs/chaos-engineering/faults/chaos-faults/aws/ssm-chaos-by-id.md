AWS SSM chaos by ID induces chaos on AWS EC2 instances using the Amazon SSM Run Command.
- It is executed using the SSM document that defines the actions which the systems manager can perform on your managed instances (that have SSM agent installed).
- This SSM document is uploaded beforehand to AWS, whose name is referenced as an input to the chaos faults.
- It helps execute custom chaos (like stress, network, disk or IO) on AWS EC2 instances for a specific duration using the given instance ID(s).

## Use cases
AWS SSM chaos by ID:
- Tests the resilience of EC2 instance or services in that instance by using custom SSM document as input to execute chaos on it.
- Triggers and manages the SSM command executed via SSM docs that is an input to the experiment.

### Prerequisites
- Kubernetes >= 1.17
- The SSM document should be available in AWS.
- Authentication is done using [IRSA](/docs/chaos-engineering/faults/chaos-faults/aws/security-configurations/aws-iam-integration#set-up-your-target-accounts-for-irsa) or secret. For secret-based authentication, create a Kubernetes secret that has the AWS access configuration(key) in the `CHAOS_NAMESPACE`. Below is a sample secret file:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: cloud-secret
type: Opaque
stringData:
  cloud_config.yml: |-
    # Add the cloud AWS credentials respectively
    [default]
    aws_access_key_id = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    aws_secret_access_key = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

:::tip
HCE recommends that you use the same secret name, that is, `cloud-secret`. Otherwise, you will need to update the `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` environment variable in the fault template with the new secret name and you won't be able to use the default health check probes.

Below is an example AWS policy to execute the fault.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:DescribeInstances"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ssm:DescribeInstanceInformation",
                "ssm:SendCommand",
                "ssm:GetCommandInvocation",
                "ssm:CancelCommand"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

:::info note
- Refer to [AWS named profile for chaos](/docs/chaos-engineering/faults/chaos-faults/aws/security-configurations/aws-switch-profile) to use a different profile for AWS faults.
- The EC2 instance should be in a healthy state before and after introducing chaos.
- Refer to the [common attributes](/docs/chaos-engineering/faults/chaos-faults/common-tunables-for-all-faults) and [AWS-specific tunables](/docs/chaos-engineering/faults/chaos-faults/aws/aws-fault-tunables) to tune the common tunables for all faults and AWS-specific tunables.
- Refer to the [superset permission/policy](/docs/chaos-engineering/faults/chaos-faults/aws/security-configurations/policy-for-all-aws-faults) to execute all AWS faults.

### SSM chaos by ID

Comma-separated list of target instance IDs. Tune it by using the `EC2_INSTANCE_ID` environment variable.

The following YAML snippet illustrates the use of this environment variable:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/ssm-chaos-by-id/instance-id.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# contains the instance id, to be terminated/stopped
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: ssm-chaos-by-id
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # ID of the EC2 instance
        - name: EC2_INSTANCE_ID
          value: 'instance-1'
        # region for the EC2 instance
        - name: REGION
          value: 'us-east-1'
```
