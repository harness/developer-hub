    <td>The native Linux chaos agent comprises a systemd-based service (configured with post hook). The agent config, logs and cron configuration are stored in dedicated, predefined paths.</td>

    <th>Execution Control</th>
    <td><ul><li>**Abort Support:** Yes. Internally invokes cancellation of the SSM command (which in turn is a bash script).

    <td><ul><li>**Abort Support:** Yes. An abort-watcher ensures graceful cancellation of the chaos process.</li>
    <li>**Chaos Agent Crash:** The agent service is configured with the right hooks (ExecStart/Stop) which removes all residual chaos on the system as a safety measure.</li></ul></td>
