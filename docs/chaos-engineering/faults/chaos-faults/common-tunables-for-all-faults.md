# Common Tunables for All Faults

Fault tunables common to all chaos faults are provided at `.spec.experiment[*].spec.components.env` in the ChaosEngine specification. These tunables control the basic execution behavior of chaos experiments.

## Core Tunables

### Duration of the Chaos

Total duration of the chaos injection in seconds. Configure using the `TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION` environment variable.

**Default**: 30 seconds

```yaml
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  experiments:
  - name: pod-delete
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          value: '60'
```

### Chaos Interval

The delay between each chaos iteration in seconds. Configure using the `CHAOS_INTERVAL` environment variable.

**Default**: 10 seconds

```yaml
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  experiments:
  - name: pod-delete
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        - name: CHAOS_INTERVAL
          value: '15'
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          value: '60'
```

### Ramp Time

Period to wait before and after injecting chaos in seconds. Configure using the `RAMP_TIME` environment variable.

**Default**: 0 seconds

```yaml
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  experiments:
  - name: pod-delete
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        - name: RAMP_TIME
          value: '10'
```

## Execution Control

### Sequence of Chaos Execution

The sequence of chaos execution for multiple targets. Configure using the `SEQUENCE` environment variable.

**Default**: parallel

**Options**:
- `parallel`: Chaos is injected in all targets simultaneously
- `serial`: Chaos is injected in targets one by one

```yaml
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  experiments:
  - name: pod-delete
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        - name: SEQUENCE
          value: 'parallel'
```

### Instance ID

A user-defined string that holds metadata about the current chaos run. This string is appended as a suffix in the ChaosResult CR name. Configure using the `INSTANCE_ID` environment variable.

**Default**: Empty string

```yaml
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  experiments:
  - name: pod-delete
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        - name: INSTANCE_ID
          value: '123'
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Helper Pod Image

The container image used to launch helper pods for fault execution. Configure using the `LIB_IMAGE` environment variable.

**Default**: `harness/chaos-go-runner:main-latest`

**Supported Faults**: container-kill, network-faults, stress-faults, dns-faults, disk-fill, kubelet-service-kill, docker-service-kill, node-restart

```yaml
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  experiments:
  - name: container-kill
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        - name: LIB_IMAGE
          value: 'harness/chaos-go-runner:main-latest'
```

### Default Health Check

Determines whether to run the default health check included with the fault. Configure using the `DEFAULT_HEALTH_CHECK` environment variable.

**Default**: true

```yaml
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  experiments:
  - name: pod-delete
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        - name: DEFAULT_HEALTH_CHECK
          value: 'false'
```

### Status Check Timeout

Maximum duration the chaos experiment will wait for a resource to reach the desired state before proceeding. If the resource doesn't attain the expected state within this timeframe, the experiment may be marked as failed.

**Default**: 180 seconds

```yaml
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  experiments:
  - name: pod-delete
    spec:
      components:
        statusCheckTimeouts:
          delay: 2
          timeout: 300
```

## Summary

These common tunables provide fine-grained control over chaos fault execution. Use them to:

- **Control timing**: Set duration, intervals, and ramp times
- **Manage execution**: Configure sequence and health checks
- **Customize behavior**: Set instance IDs and helper images
- **Ensure reliability**: Configure appropriate timeouts

For fault-specific tunables, refer to the individual fault documentation in each category.
