This section describes Kyverno policies that enforce runtime security.

[Kyverno policies](https://kyverno.io/policies/pod-security/) block configurations that don't match a policy (enforce mode) or can generate policy violations (audit mode). It scans existing configurations and reports violations in the cluster.
CE recommends using the provided policy configuration to enable the execution of all supported (out-of-the-box) experiments listed in the Enterprise ChaosHub. This is only a recommendation and is left to user discretion depending on the experiments desired.

The details listed here are expected to aid users of Kyverno. To use alternate means to enforce runtime security, such as native Kubernetes PSPs (pod security policies), use [PSP](/docs/chaos-engineering/architecture-and-security/security/security-templates/psp.md).

## Policies in HCE

HCE recommends using the following policies:

1. [Add capabilities](./manifest/kyverno-policies/allow-capabilities-for-litmus-experiments-which-uses-runtime-api.yaml): It restricts add capabilities except the `NET_ADMIN` and `SYS_ADMIN` for the pods that use runtime API.
2. [Host namespaces](./manifest/kyverno-policies/allow-host-namespaces-for-litmus-experiments-which-uses-runtime-api.yaml): It validates the following host namespaces for the pods that use runtime API.
    1. HostPID: It allows hostPID. It should be set to `true`.
    2. HostIPC: It restricts the host IPC. It should be set to `false`.
    3. HostNetwork: It restricts the hostNetwork. It should be set to `false`.
3. [Host paths](./manifest/kyverno-policies/allow-host-paths-for-litmus-experiments-which-uses-hostPaths.yaml): It restricts hostPath except for the `socket-path` and `container-path` host paths for the pods that use runtime API. It allows hostPaths for service-kill experiments.
4. [Privilege escalation](./manifest/kyverno-policies/allow-privilege-escalation-for-litmus-experiments-which-uses-runtime-api.yaml): It restricts privilege escalation except for the pods that use runtime API.
5. [Privilege container](./manifest/kyverno-policies/allow-privileged-containers-for-litmus-experiments-which-uses-runtime-api.yaml): It restricts privileged containers except for the pods that use runtime API.
6. [User groups](./manifest/kyverno-policies/allow-user-groups-for-litmus-experiments.yaml): It allows user groups for all the experiment pods.

## Install policies

Kyverno policies are based on the [Kubernetes pod security standards](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/) definitions. It is recommended that you apply all the pod security policies. To apply all the pod security policies, [install Kyverno](https://kyverno.io/docs/installation/) and [kustomize](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/installation/kustomize/binaries/), and run:

```bash
kustomize build https://github.com/litmuschaos/chaos-charts/security/kyverno-policies | kubectl apply -f -
```

## Pod security policies in restricted setup

If a setup contains restricted policies, it will not allow HCE experiments to be executed by default. For example, [disallow-privilege-escalation](https://kyverno.io/policies/pod-security/restricted/disallow-privilege-escalation/disallow-privilege-escalation/) policy doesn't allow privileged escalation. It denies all the pods of privileged escalation.

To allow HCE pods to use the privileged escalation, add the HCE service account or ClusterRole or Role inside the **exclude** block as:

      Privilege escalation, such as via set-user-ID or set-group-ID file mode, should not be allowed.
      This policy ensures the `allowPrivilegeEscalation` fields are either undefined
      or set to `false`.
