VMware disk loss detaches the disks that are attached to a Linux OS based VMware VM.

:::info note
HCE doesn't support injecting VMWare Windows faults on Bare metal server.
:::

## Use cases

- VMware disk loss determines the resilience of an application to the unplanned scaling of K8s pods.

### Prerequisites
- Kubernetes > 1.16 is required to execute this fault.
- The VM should be in a healthy state before and after injecting chaos.
- The target disks should be attached to the VM.
- Execution plane should be connected to vCenter and host vCenter on port 443.
- VMware tool should be installed on the target VM with remote execution enabled.
- Appropriate vCenter permissions should be provided to access the hosts and the VMs.
- Create a Kubernetes secret that has the Vcenter credentials in the `CHAOS_NAMESPACE`. Below is a sample secret file:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: vcenter-secret
  namespace: litmus
type: Opaque
stringData:
    VCENTERSERVER: XXXXXXXXXXX
    VCENTERUSER: XXXXXXXXXXXXX
    VCENTERPASS: XXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

### Mandatory tunables

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td> APP_VM_MOIDS </td>
        <td> MOIDs of the VMware instance. After you open the VM in VCenter WebClient, you can find the MOID in the address field (VirtualMachine:vm-5365). Alternatively you can use the CLI to fetch the MOID. </td>
        <td> For example, <code>vm-5365</code>. For more information, go to <a href="/docs/chaos-engineering/use-harness-ce/chaos-faults/vmware/VMware-vm-power-off#stoppoweroff-the-vm-by-moid"> MOIDs of the VMware instance.</a></td>

### Virtual disk names
It specifies the name of the target disks attached to a particular VM. Tune it by using the `VIRTUAL_DISK_NAMES` environment variable.

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/vmware-disk-loss/vm-disk-loss-diskname.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# Disk loss in the VMware VM
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: VMware-disk-loss
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # Name of the VM
        - name: APP_VM_MOIDS
          value: 'vm-2055'
        # Name of target disk
        - name: VIRTUAL_DISK_NAMES
          value: 'disk-1.vmdk'
```
