VMware CPU hog applies stress on the CPU resources on Linux OS based VMware VM. It checks the performance of the application running on the VMware VMs.

:::info note
HCE doesn't support injecting VMWare Windows faults on Bare metal server.
:::

## Use cases

- VMware CPU hog determines the resilience of an application when stress is applied on the CPU resources of a VMware virtual machine.
- VMware CPU hog simulates the situation of lack of CPU for processes running on the application, which degrades their performance.
- It also helps verify metrics-based horizontal pod autoscaling as well as vertical autoscale, that is, demand based CPU addition.
- It verifies the autopilot functionality of cloud managed clusters.
- It verifies multi-tenant load issues, that is, when the load on one container increases, it should not cause downtime in other containers.

### Prerequisites
- Kubernetes > 1.16 is required to execute this fault.
- Execution plane should be connected to vCenter and host vCenter on port 443.
- VMware tool should be installed on the target VM with remote execution enabled.
- Adequate vCenter permissions should be provided to access the hosts and the VMs.
- The VM should be in a healthy state before and after injecting chaos.
- Run the fault with a user possessing admin rights, preferably the built-in Administrator, to guarantee permissions for memory stress testing. [See how to enable the built-in Administrator in Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/enable-and-disable-the-built-in-administrator-account?view=windows-11).

- Kubernetes secret has to be created that has the Vcenter credentials in the `CHAOS_NAMESPACE`. VM credentials can be passed as secrets or as a `ChaosEngine` environment variable. Below is a sample secret file:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: vcenter-secret
  namespace: litmus
type: Opaque
stringData:
    VCENTERSERVER: XXXXXXXXXXX
    VCENTERUSER: XXXXXXXXXXXXX
    VCENTERPASS: XXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

### CPU cores
It specifies the number of CPU cores of the target VM on which stress is applied. Tune it by using the `CPU_CORE` environment variable.

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/vmware-cpu-hog/vm-cpu-hog-core.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# CPU hog in the VMware VM
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: VMware-cpu-hog
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # Name of the VM
        - name: VM_NAME
          value: 'test-vm-01'
       # CPU cores for stress
        - name: CPU_CORES
          value: '1'
```

### CPU load
It specifies the load exerted on each VM CPU core (in percentage). Tune it by using the `CPU_LOAD` environment variable.

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/vmware-cpu-hog/vm-cpu-hog-load.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# CPU hog in the VMware VM
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: VMware-cpu-hog
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # Name of the VM
        - name: VM_NAME
          value: 'test-vm-01'
        # CPU load in percentage for the stress
        - name: CPU_LOAD
          value: '100'
```
