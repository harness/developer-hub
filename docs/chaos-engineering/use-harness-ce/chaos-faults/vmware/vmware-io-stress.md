VMware IO stress causes disk stress on the target VMware VMs. It aims to verify the resilience of applications that share this disk resource with the VM.

:::info note
HCE doesn't support injecting VMWare Windows faults on Bare metal server.
:::

## Use cases

- VMware IO stress determines the resilience of an application to unexpected spikes in resources.
- It determines how well an application handles unexpected I/O stress.
- It simulates slower disk operations by the application.
- It simulates noisy neighbour problems by hogging the disk bandwidth.
- It verifies the disk performance on increasing I/O threads and varying I/O block sizes.
- It checks whether the application functions well under high disk latency conditions.
- It checks for high I/O traffic that includes large I/O blocks, and in what cases other services monopolize the I/O disks.

### Prerequisites
- Kubernetes > 1.16 is required to execute this fault.
- Execution plane should be connected to vCenter and host vCenter on port 443.
- The VM should be in a healthy state before and after injecting chaos.
- VMware tool should be installed on the target VM with remote execution enabled.
- Appropriate vCenter permissions should be provided to access the hosts and the VMs.
- Kubernetes secret has to be created that has the Vcenter credentials in the `CHAOS_NAMESPACE`. VM credentials can be passed as secrets or as a `ChaosEngine` environment variable. Below is a sample secret file:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: vcenter-secret
  namespace: litmus
type: Opaque
stringData:
    VCENTERSERVER: XXXXXXXXXXX
    VCENTERUSER: XXXXXXXXXXXXX
    VCENTERPASS: XXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

### Filesystem utilization percentage
It specifies the size as a percentage of free space on the file system. Tune it by using the `FILESYSTEM_UTILIZATION_PERCENTAGE` environment variable.

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/vmware-io-stress/vm-io-stress-filesystem-utilization-percentage.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# io-stress in the VMware VM
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: VMware-io-stress
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # Name of the VM
        - name: VM_NAME
          value: 'test-vm-01'
        # percentage of free space of file system, need to be stressed
        - name: FILESYSTEM_UTILIZATION_PERCENTAGE
          value: '10'
```

### Filesystem utilization bytes
It specifies the amount of free space on the file system in gigabytes(GB). Tune it by using the `FILESYSTEM_UTILIZATION_BYTES` environment variable. `FILESYSTEM_UTILIZATION_BYTES` is mutually exclusive with the `FILESYSTEM_UTILIZATION_PERCENTAGE` environment variable. If both `FILESYSTEM_UTILIZATION_PERCENTAGE` and `FILESYSTEM_UTILIZATION_BYTES` environment variables are set, `FILESYSTEM_UTILIZATION_PERCENTAGE` takes precedence.

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/vmware-io-stress/vm-io-stress-filesystem-utilization-bytes.yaml yaml)
```yaml
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: VMware-io-stress
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # Name of the VM
        - name: VM_NAME
          value: 'test-vm-01'
        # size of io to be stressed
        - name: FILESYSTEM_UTILIZATION_BYTES
          value: '1' #in GB
```
### Mount path
It specifies the location that points to the volume mount path used in I/O stress. Tune it by using the  `VOLUME_MOUNT_PATH` environment variable.

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/vmware-io-stress/vm-io-stress-filesystem-mount-path.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# io-stress in the VMware VM
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: VMware-io-stress
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # Name of the VM
        - name: VM_NAME
          value: 'test-vm-01'
        # path need to be stressed/filled
        - name: VOLUME_MOUNT_PATH
          value: '/some-dir-in-container'
        # size of io to be stressed
        - name: FILESYSTEM_UTILIZATION_BYTES
          value: '1' #in GB
```
### Workers for stress
It specifies the worker's count for stress. Tune it by using the `NUMBER_OF_WORKERS` environment variable.
Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/vmware-io-stress/vm-io-stress-filesystem-worker.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# io-stress in the VMware VM
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: VMware-io-stress
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # Name of the VM
        - name: VM_NAME
          value: 'test-vm-01'
        # number of io workers
        - name: NUMBER_OF_WORKERS
          value: '4'
        # size of io to be stressed
        - name: FILESYSTEM_UTILIZATION_BYTES
          value: '1' #in GB
```
