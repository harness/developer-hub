VMware service stop stops the target system services running on a Linux OS based VMware VM. It determines the performance and resilience of the application (or service) running on the VMware VMs.

:::info note
HCE doesn't support injecting VMWare Windows faults on Bare metal server.
:::

## Use cases
VMware service stop:
- Determines the resilience of an application to random halts.
- Determines how efficiently an application recovers and restarts the services.

### Prerequisites
- Kubernetes > 1.16 is required to execute this fault.
- Execution plane should be connected to vCenter and host vCenter on port 443.
- The VM should be in a healthy state before and after injecting chaos.
- VMware tool should be installed on the target VM with remote execution enabled.
- The target processes should exist within the VM.
- Appropriate vCenter permissions should be provided to access the hosts and the VMs.
- Kubernetes secret has to be created that has the Vcenter credentials in the `CHAOS_NAMESPACE`. VM credentials can be passed as secrets or as a `ChaosEngine` environment variable. Below is a sample secret file:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: vcenter-secret
  namespace: litmus
type: Opaque
stringData:
    VCENTERSERVER: XXXXXXXXXXX
    VCENTERUSER: XXXXXXXXXXXXX
    VCENTERPASS: XXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

### Self-healing services
It specifies whether the target service has the ability to self-heal. It is self-healing if it is set to `enable`. Its default value is `disable`. Tune it by using the `SELF_HEALING_SERVICES` environment variable.

Use the following example to tune this:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/vmware-service-stop/vmware-service-stop-self-healing.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# Service Stop in the VMware VM
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
    - name: VMware-service-stop
      spec:
        components:
          env:
            # Name of the VM
            - name: VM_NAME
              value: 'test-vm-01'
            # Name of service
            - name: SERVICE_NAME
              value: 'nginx'
            # Self-heling ability
            - name: SELF_HEALING_SERVICES
              value: 'enable'
```

### Service name
It specifies the name of the target service running on a particular VM. Tune it by using the `SERVICE_NAME` environment variable.

Use the following example to tune this:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/vmware-service-stop/vmware-service-stop.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# Service Stop in the VMware VM
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
    - name: VMware-service-stop
      spec:
        components:
          env:
            # Name of the VM
            - name: VM_NAME
              value: 'test-vm-01'
            # Name of service
            - name: SERVICE_NAME
              value: 'nginx'
```
