VMware DNS chaos causes DNS errors in the VMware VMs which results in the DNS server being unavailable or malfunctioning for a specific duration. It checks the performance of the application (or process) running on the VMware VMs.

:::info note
HCE doesn't support injecting VMWare Windows faults on Bare metal server.
:::

## Use cases

- VMware DNS chaos causes DNS errors on the target VMs which results in unavailability (or distorted) network connectivity from the VM to the target hosts.
- It provides a hypothesis wherein certain services of an application could be unreachable from the VM.
- It determines how DNS errors impact the infrastructure and standalone tasks in the application.
- It simulates unavailability of DNS server, that is, loss of access to any external domain from a given microservice.
- It simulates malfunctioning of DNS server, that is, loss of access to specific domains from a given microservice, loss of access to cloud provider dependencies, and loss of access to specific third party services.

### Prerequisites
- Kubernetes > 1.16 is required to execute this fault.
- Execution plane should be connected to vCenter and host vCenter on port 443.
- VMware tool should be installed on the target VM with remote execution enabled.
- The VM should be in a healthy state before and after injecting chaos.
- Appropriate vCenter permissions should be provided to access the hosts and the VMs.
- Kubernetes secret has to be created that has the Vcenter credentials in the `CHAOS_NAMESPACE`. VM credentials can be passed as secrets or as a `ChaosEngine` environment variable. Below is a sample secret file:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: vcenter-secret
  namespace: litmus
type: Opaque
stringData:
    VCENTERSERVER: XXXXXXXXXXX
    VCENTERUSER: XXXXXXXXXXXXX
    VCENTERPASS: XXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

### Run DNS chaos with port

It specifies the DNS port where DNS chaos is injected. Tune it by using the `PORT` environment variable.

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/vmware-dns-chaos/vmware-dns-port.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# induces DNS chaos on the VMware VM
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: VMware-engine
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: VMware-DNS-chaos
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        - name: PORT
          value: '54'
        - name: VM_NAME
          value: 'vm-1,vm-2'
        - name: VM_USER_NAME
          value: 'ubuntu,debian'
        - name: VM_PASSWORD
          value: '123,123'
```

### Run DNS chaos with target host names

It specifies the list of the target host names into which DNS chaos is injected. Tune it by using the `TARGET_HOSTNAMES` environment variable.

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/vmware-dns-chaos/vmware-dns-target-hostnames.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# induces DNS chaos on the VMware VMs
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: VMware-DNS-chaos
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # list of target host names
        - name: TARGET_HOSTNAMES
          value: '["litmuschaos","chaosnative.com"]'
        - name: VM_NAME
          value: 'vm-1,vm-2'
        - name: VM_USER_NAME
          value: 'ubuntu,debian'
        - name: VM_PASSWORD
          value: '123,123'
```


### Run DNS chaos with match scheme

It specifies whether the DNS query should exactly match the targets or can be a substring. Tune it by using the `MATCH_SCHEME` environment variable.

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/vmware-dns-chaos/vmware-dns-match-scheme.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# induces DNS chaos on the VMware VMs
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: VMware-DNS-chaos
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # match scheme type
        - name: MATCH_SCHEME
          value: 'exact'
        - name: VM_NAME
          value: 'vm-1,vm-2'
        - name: VM_USER_NAME
          value: 'ubuntu,debian'
        - name: VM_PASSWORD
          value: '123,123'
```


### Run DNS chaos with upstream server

It specifies the custom upstream server to which the intercepted DNS requests are forwarded. It defaults to the server mentioned in the `resolv.conf` file. Tune it by using the `UPSTREAM_SERVER` environment variable.

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/vmware-dns-chaos/vmware-dns-upstream-server.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# induces DNS chaos on the VMware VMs
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: VMware-DNS-chaos
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # name of the upstream server
        - name: UPSTREAM_SERVER
          value: '8.8.8.8'
        - name: VM_NAME
          value: 'vm-1,vm-2'
        - name: VM_USER_NAME
          value: 'ubuntu,debian'
        - name: VM_PASSWORD
          value: '123,123'
```
