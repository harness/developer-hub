VMware HTTP reset peer injects HTTP reset chaos that stops the outgoing HTTP requests by resetting the TCP connection for the requests.
- The service whose port is affected is specified using the `TARGET_SERVICE_PORT` environment variable.
- It tests the application's resilience to lossy (or flaky) HTTP connections.

:::info note
HCE doesn't support injecting VMWare Windows faults on Bare metal server.
:::

## Use cases

- VMware HTTP reset peer determines the resilience of an application to unexpected halts in the outgoing HTTP requests.
- It determines how quickly and efficiently an application recovers from these unexpected halts.
- It simulates premature connection loss, such as firewall issues, between microservices by verifying connection timeouts.
- It simulates connection resets due to resource limitations on the server side, such as running out of memory, killing processes, or overloading the server due to high amounts of traffic.

### Prerequisites
- Kubernetes >= 1.17 is required to execute this fault.
- Appropriate vCenter permissions should be provided to start and stop the VMs.
- The VM should be in a healthy state before and after injecting chaos.
- Kubernetes secret has to be created that has the Vcenter credentials in the `CHAOS_NAMESPACE`. VM credentials can be passed as secrets or as a `ChaosEngine` environment variable. Below is a sample secret file:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
    name: vcenter-secret
    namespace: litmus
type: Opaque
stringData:
    VCENTERSERVER: XXXXXXXXXXX
    VCENTERUSER: XXXXXXXXXXXXX
    VCENTERPASS: XXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

        - name: TARGET_SERVICE_PORT
          value: "80"
```
