VMware HTTP latency injects HTTP response latency into the service of a specific port.
- This is achieved by starting the proxy server and redirecting the traffic through the proxy server.
- It helps determine the application's resilience to lossy (or flaky) HTTP responses.

:::info note
HCE doesn't support injecting VMWare Windows faults on Bare metal server.
:::

## Use cases

- VMware HTTP latency determines the resilience of an application to HTTP latency.
- It determines how the system recovers or fetches the responses when there is a delay in accessing the service.
- It simulates latency to specific API services for (or from) a given microservice.
- It also simulates a slow response on specific third party (or dependent) components (or services).

### Prerequisites
- Kubernetes >= 1.17 is required to execute this fault.
- Appropriate vCenter permissions should be provided to start and stop the VMs.
- The VM should be in a healthy state before and after injecting chaos.
- Kubernetes secret has to be created that has the Vcenter credentials in the `CHAOS_NAMESPACE`. VM credentials can be passed as secrets or as a `ChaosEngine` environment variable. Below is a sample secret file:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
    name: vcenter-secret
    namespace: litmus
type: Opaque
stringData:
    VCENTERSERVER: XXXXXXXXXXX
    VCENTERUSER: XXXXXXXXXXXXX
    VCENTERPASS: XXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

### Target service port

It specifies the port of the target service. Tune it by using the `TARGET_SERVICE_PORT` environment variable.

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/http-latency/target-service-port.yaml yaml)
```yaml
## provide the port of the targeted service
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: VMware-http-latency
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # provide the port of the targeted service
        - name: TARGET_SERVICE_PORT
          value: "80"
```

### Proxy Port

It specifies the port where the proxy server listens for requests. Tune it by using the `PROXY_PORT` environment variable.

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/http-latency/proxy-port.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# provide the port for proxy server
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: VMware-http-latency
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # provide the port for proxy server
        - name: PROXY_PORT
          value: '8080'
        # provide the port of the targeted service
        - name: TARGET_SERVICE_PORT
          value: "80"
```

### Latency

It specifies the latency value added to the HTTP request. Tune it by using the `LATENCY` environment variable.

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/http-latency/latency.yaml yaml)
```yaml
## provide the latency value
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"

        - name: TARGET_SERVICE_PORT
          value: "80"
```

### Toxicity

It specifies the toxicity value added to the HTTP request. Toxicity value defines the percentage of the total number of HTTP requests that are affected. Tune it by using the `TOXICITY` environment variable.

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/http-latency/toxicity.yaml yaml)
```yaml
## provide the toxicity
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: VMware-http-latency
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # toxicity is the probability of the request to be affected
        # provide the percentage value in the range of 0-100
        # 0 means no request will be affected and 100 means all request will be affected
        - name: TOXICITY
          value: "100"
        # provide the port of the targeted service
        - name: TARGET_SERVICE_PORT
          value: "80"
```

### Network interface

```yaml
## provide the network interface for proxy
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: VMware-http-latency
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # provide the network interface for proxy
        - name: NETWORK_INTERFACE
