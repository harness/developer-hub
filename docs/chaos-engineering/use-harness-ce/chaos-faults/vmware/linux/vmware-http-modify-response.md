VMware HTTP modify response injects HTTP chaos by modifying the status code, body or the headers, which affects the request (or response).
- Chaos is injected by starting the proxy server and redirecting the traffic through the proxy server.
- It tests the application's resilience to erroneous (or incorrect) HTTP response body.
- It modifies the headers of the requests and the responses of the service. This helps test the service's resilience towards incorrect or incomplete headers.

:::info note
HCE doesn't support injecting VMWare Windows faults on Bare metal server.
:::

## Use cases

- VMware HTTP modify response determines the resilience of an application to modifications in the status code or body or header of the request (or response).
- It measures how accurately the application spots incorrect HTTP response body.

### Prerequisites
- Kubernetes >= 1.17 is required to execute this fault.
- Appropriate vCenter permissions should be provided to start and stop the VMs.
- The VM should be in a healthy state before and after injecting chaos.
- Kubernetes secret has to be created that has the Vcenter credentials in the `CHAOS_NAMESPACE`. VM credentials can be passed as secrets or as a `ChaosEngine` environment variable. Below is a sample secret file:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
    name: vcenter-secret
    namespace: litmus
type: Opaque
stringData:
    VCENTERSERVER: XXXXXXXXXXX
    VCENTERUSER: XXXXXXXXXXXXX
    VCENTERPASS: XXXXXXXXXXXXX
```
