VMware Windows memory hog applies stress on the Memory resources on Windows OS based VMware VM. It checks the performance of the application running on the VMware Windows VMs.

:::info note
HCE doesn't support injecting VMWare Windows faults on Bare metal server.
:::

## Use cases
VMware Windows memory hog:
- Determines the resilience of an application when stress is applied on the Memory resources of a VMware Windows virtual machine.
- Simulates the situation of lack of Memory for processes running on the application, which degrades their performance.
- Verifies the autopilot functionality of services or application on the VM.

### Prerequisites
- Kubernetes > 1.16 is required to execute this fault.
- Execution plane should be connected to vCenter and host vCenter on port 443.
- VMware tool should be installed on the target VM with remote execution enabled.
- Adequate vCenter permissions should be provided to access the hosts and the VMs.
- The VM should be in a healthy state before and after injecting chaos.
- Kubernetes secret has to be created that has the Vcenter credentials in the `CHAOS_NAMESPACE`.
- Ensure installation of [Testlimit](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/testlimit) on the target VM, a prerequisite for this experiment. Execute the fault using the built-in Administrator user to ensure permissions for memory stress testing. [Instructions to enable the built-in Administrator in Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/enable-and-disable-the-built-in-administrator-account?view=windows-11).

- VM credentials can be passed as secrets or as a chaos engine environment variable.

```yaml

  namespace: litmus
type: Opaque
stringData:
    VCENTERSERVER: XXXXXXXXXXX
    VCENTERUSER: XXXXXXXXXXXXX
    VCENTERPASS: XXXXXXXXXXXXX

### Memory consumption
The `MEMORY_CONSUMPTION` environment variable applies stress on the target Windows VM for a specific duration.

Use the following example to specify Memory consumption:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/vmware-windows-memory-hog/vm-memory-hog-consumption.yaml yaml)
```yaml
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: vmware-windows-memory-hog
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # Name of the VM
        - name: VM_NAME
          value: 'test-vm-01'
       # Memory consumption in MB
        - name: MEMORY_CONSUMPTION
          value: '1024'
```

### Memory percentage
The `MEMORY_PERCENTAGE` environment variable applies stress on the target Windows VM for a specific duration. It consumes the specified percentage of the total Memory resources.

Use the following example to specify Memory percentage:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/vmware-windows-memory-hog/vm-memory-hog-percentage.yaml yaml)

```yaml
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: vmware-windows-memory-hog
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # Name of the VM
        - name: VM_NAME
          value: 'test-vm-01'
       # Memory percentage to consume
        - name: MEMORY_PERCENTAGE
          value: '50'
```
