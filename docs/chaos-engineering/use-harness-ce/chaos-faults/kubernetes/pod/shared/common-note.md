A transient proxy (also known as helper pod) is brought up for a [chaos duration](/docs/chaos-engineering/use-harness-ce/chaos-faults/common-tunables-for-all-faults) to intercept the requests made from the target application to another service and elsewhere, and inject chaos accordingly. Target application refers to the application pods calling/sending egress traffic to an endpoint.
