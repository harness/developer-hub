title: Windows Network Loss
---

Windows network loss causes network packet loss on Windows VM for the target hosts or IP addresses using [Clumsy](https://jagt.github.io/clumsy/). It checks the performance of the services running on the Windows VMs after the disrupted network loss conditions.

## Use cases

Windows network loss:
- Simulates issues within the host network (or microservice) communication across services in different hosts.
- Determines the impact of degradation while accessing a microservice.
- Limits the impact (blast radius) to the traffic that you wish to test by specifying the IP addresses, if the VM stalls or gets corrupted while waiting endlessly for a packet.
- Simulates degraded network with varied percentages of dropped packets between microservices.
- Simulates loss of access to specific third party (or dependent) services (or components).
- Simulates blackhole against traffic to a given availability zone, that is, failure simulation of availability zones.
- Simulates network partitions (split-brain) between peer replicas for a stateful application.

## Prerequisites
- Ensure that the [prerequisites](/docs/chaos-engineering/use-harness-ce/chaos-faults/windows/prerequisites) are fulfilled before executing the experiment.
- Verify that [Clumsy](https://app.harness.io/public/shared/tools/chaos/windows/clumsy-0.3-win64-a.zip) is installed on the Windows VM.

        <td> NETWORK_PACKET_LOSS_PERCENTAGE </td>
        <td> The percentage of data packets lost during transmission. </td>
        <td> For example, 100. For more information, go to <a href="#network-packet-loss"> network packet loss. </a></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td> DESTINATION_HOSTS </td>
          <td> DNS or FQDN names of services whose access is affected. You can specify multiple inputs as comma-separated values. </td>

        <td> IP addresses of the target destination services. You can specify multiple inputs as comma-separated values.</td>
        <td> It is mutually exclusive with <code>DESTINATION_HOSTS</code> variable. For example, '0.8.0.8,192.168.5.6'. For more information, go to <a href="#destination-ips"> destination IPs. </a></td>

### Network packet loss

The `NETWORK_PACKET_LOSS_PERCENTAGE` environment variable specifies the percentage of data packets lost during transmission.

Use the following example to specify network packet loss:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/windows-network-loss/network-packet-loss.yaml yaml)
```yaml
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: MachineChaosExperiment
metadata:
  name: windows-network-loss
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
    infraType: windows
    steps:
      - - name: windows-network-loss
    tasks:
    - definition:
        chaos:
          env:
            - name: NETWORK_PACKET_LOSS_PERCENTAGE
              value: "100"
```

### Destination hosts
The `DESTINATION_HOSTS` environment variable specifies the destination hosts to induce network loss on the target Windows VM. You can provide multiple values using comma-separated list. 
`DESTINATION_HOSTS` and `DESTINATION_IPS` environment variables are mutually exclusive.

Use the following example to specify destination hosts:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/windows-network-loss/destination-hosts.yaml yaml)
```yaml
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: MachineChaosExperiment
metadata:
  name: windows-network-loss
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
    infraType: windows
    steps:
      - - name: windows-network-loss
    tasks:
    - definition:
        chaos:
          env:
            - name: DESTINATION_HOSTS
              value: "aws.amazon.com,github.com"
```

### Destination IPS

The `DESTINATION_IPS` environment variable specifies the IP addresses of target destination services. You can specify multiple inputs as comma-separated values. 
`DESTINATION_IPS` and `DESTINATION_HOSTS` environment variables are mutually exclusive.

Use the following example to specify destination IPS:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/windows-network-loss/destination-ips.yaml yaml)
```yaml
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: MachineChaosExperiment
metadata:
  name: windows-network-loss
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
    infraType: windows
    steps:
      - - name: windows-network-loss
    tasks:
    - definition:
        chaos:
          env:
            - name: DESTINATION_IPS
              value: '0.8.0.8,192.168.5.6'
```
