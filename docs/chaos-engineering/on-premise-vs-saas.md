# On-premise vs SaaS

Harness Chaos Engineering offers two deployment options to meet your organization's requirements. Choose between the fully managed SaaS solution or deploy the Self-Managed Enterprise Edition on-premises.

## Harness Chaos Engineering SaaS

### Overview
Harness SaaS is a fully managed, cloud-hosted solution that provides immediate access to chaos engineering capabilities without infrastructure setup or maintenance overhead.

### Key Features
- **Quick Setup**: Start running chaos experiments within minutes
- **Managed Infrastructure**: No need to manage underlying platform components
- **Automatic Updates**: Always access the latest features and patches
- **Enterprise ChaosHub**: Built-in access to 200+ pre-built chaos faults
- **AIDA Support**: AI Development Assistant for creating governance policies

### What's Included
- **Complete Platform**: Full chaos engineering capabilities out-of-the-box
- **Enterprise ChaosHub**: Access to comprehensive fault library
- **Harness AIDA**: AI assistant for policy creation and optimization
- **Managed Services**: Platform maintenance handled by Harness
- **Standard Integrations**: Built-in connectors for popular tools    

### Ideal For
- Organizations wanting to get started quickly
- Teams focused on application development over infrastructure
- Companies with standard compliance requirements
- Development and testing environments

## Self-Managed Enterprise Edition (On-Premise)

### Overview
The Self-Managed Enterprise Edition allows you to run Harness Chaos Engineering entirely within your own infrastructure, providing complete control over your chaos engineering environment.

### Key Features
- **Complete Data Control**: All data remains within your infrastructure
- **Feature Parity**: Same capabilities as SaaS with minor timeline differences
- **Network Isolation**: Deploy in air-gapped or restricted environments
- **Custom Configuration**: Tailor the platform to your specific needs
- **Enterprise Integration**: LDAP, SSO, and custom authentication

### Architecture Components
- **Chaos Control Plane**: Manages experiments and orchestration
- **Database Layer**: MongoDB and TimescaleDB for data storage
- **Monitoring Stack**: Prometheus and Grafana for observability
- **Authentication Service**: User management and access control
- **Load Balancer**: NGINX or Istio virtual services

### Infrastructure Requirements

#### Minimum Requirements
- **CPU**: 16 cores total
- **Memory**: 32 GB RAM
- **Storage**: 500 GB SSD
- **Kubernetes**: v1.21+ (any CNCF-certified distribution)

#### Recommended for Production
- **CPU**: 32+ cores
- **Memory**: 64+ GB RAM
- **Storage**: 1+ TB NVMe SSD
- **High Availability**: Multi-node setup with redundancy

### Deployment Options
- **Cloud**: Deploy on public cloud Kubernetes services
- **Connected**: On-premises with internet connectivity
- **Air-gapped**: Completely isolated environments
- **Signed Certificates**: Custom certificate management

### Limitations Compared to SaaS
- **Enterprise ChaosHub**: Not connected by default
  - Contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io) for access
  - Can be added as a [custom ChaosHub](/docs/chaos-engineering/guides/chaoshubs/)
- **Harness AIDA**: AI Development Assistant not available
- **Updates**: Manual deployment of platform updates required
- **Maintenance**: Customer responsibility for platform operations
