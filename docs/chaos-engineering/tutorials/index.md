# Chaos Engineering Tutorials

Learn chaos engineering through hands-on tutorials and real-world examples. These tutorials will guide you through creating and running various types of chaos experiments.

## Getting Started Tutorials

- **Your First Chaos Experiment**: Create and run a simple CPU stress test
- **Network Latency Injection**: Simulate network delays and packet loss
- **Service Failure Simulation**: Test application resilience to service outages

## Advanced Tutorials

- **Multi-Service Experiments**: Coordinate chaos across multiple services
- **Scheduled Experiments**: Automate chaos testing with schedules
- **Custom Fault Development**: Create your own fault types

## Platform-Specific Tutorials

### Kubernetes
- Pod failure experiments
- Node drain scenarios
- Resource exhaustion tests

### AWS
- EC2 instance termination
- RDS failover testing
- Load balancer failures

### Azure
- Virtual machine failures
- Storage account disruptions
- Network security group modifications

## Integration Tutorials

- **CI/CD Integration**: Incorporate chaos testing into your deployment pipeline
- **Monitoring Integration**: Connect experiments with your observability stack
- **Alerting Setup**: Configure alerts for experiment outcomes

## Best Practices Tutorials

- **Experiment Design**: How to design effective chaos experiments
- **Safety Measures**: Implementing safeguards and circuit breakers
- **Team Collaboration**: Building a chaos engineering culture
