During the execution of a chaos experiment, the status of execution of the constituent faults can be observed from the dashboard.

Upon the completion of the experiment execution, you can observe the final **Resiliency Score**. 

You can further scrutinize the outcome of individual faults including the status of individual probes for each fault along with the **Probe Success Percentage**.

Finally, in case any of the faults fail, you can find the **Fail Step** which elaborates the reason due to which the fault failed.
