This section walks you through the concepts of Chaos dashboard and how you can visualize different aspects of a chaos experiment.

Dashboards help visualize important metrics and data associated with your experiment runs. They help create an at-a-glance summary to understand the behavior of data. They are also used for business analysis to gain actionable insights into data.

### Chaos dashboard
Chaos dashboard is an interactive user interface that manages, visualizes, and monitors chaos experiments. It helps visualize various features associated with a chaos experiment. It provides a visual of entities in the form of a bar graph, along with a tabular representation of the visualized data.
