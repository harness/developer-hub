# Frequently Asked Questions

Find answers to the most common questions about Harness Chaos Engineering, from getting started to advanced implementation topics.

## Getting Started

### What is Chaos Engineering?
Chaos Engineering is the discipline of experimenting on a system to build confidence in the system's capability to withstand turbulent conditions in production. It involves intentionally introducing failures in a controlled manner to identify weaknesses before they cause outages.

### Why should I use Chaos Engineering?
Chaos Engineering helps you:
- **Identify weaknesses** before they cause production outages
- **Build confidence** in your system's resilience
- **Improve incident response** through practice and preparation
- **Reduce MTTR** (Mean Time To Recovery) during real incidents
- **Validate disaster recovery** procedures and assumptions

### Is Chaos Engineering safe?
Yes, when done properly. Chaos Engineering emphasizes:
- **Controlled experiments** with defined blast radius
- **Comprehensive monitoring** and automatic rollback
- **Starting small** and gradually increasing scope
- **Safety measures** and circuit breakers
- **Team coordination** and communication

### How is Harness Chaos Engineering different from other tools?
Harness Chaos Engineering offers:
- **Enterprise-grade platform** with advanced security and compliance
- **Comprehensive fault library** covering infrastructure, applications, and cloud services
- **Native CI/CD integration** for continuous resilience testing
- **Advanced automation** with intelligent rollback and remediation
- **Team collaboration features** including GameDays and shared experiments

## Implementation

### Where should I start with Chaos Engineering?
Follow this progression:
1. **Start in staging** environments, never production initially
2. **Begin with simple experiments** like pod restarts or CPU stress
3. **Use small blast radius** affecting only a few instances
4. **Set up comprehensive monitoring** before running experiments
5. **Gradually expand** scope and complexity as confidence grows

### What experiments should I run first?
Recommended first experiments:
- **Pod/Container deletion** - Test application restart resilience
- **CPU stress** - Validate auto-scaling and performance under load
- **Network latency** - Test timeout handling and user experience
- **Database connection failures** - Validate connection pooling and failover
- **Memory pressure** - Test memory management and garbage collection

### How do I choose what to test?
Consider these factors:
- **Business criticality** - Start with most important user journeys
- **Historical incidents** - Test scenarios based on past outages
- **System dependencies** - Focus on single points of failure
- **Recent changes** - Validate resilience of new features or infrastructure
- **Compliance requirements** - Test disaster recovery procedures

### How often should I run chaos experiments?
Frequency depends on your maturity:
- **Getting started**: Weekly experiments in staging
- **Intermediate**: Daily automated experiments, weekly production tests
- **Advanced**: Continuous chaos testing integrated into CI/CD
- **Mature**: Real-time chaos testing with intelligent automation

### Can I run chaos experiments in production?
Yes, but with proper precautions:
- **Start with staging** and build confidence first
- **Use small blast radius** (1-5% of instances initially)
- **Run during low-traffic periods** to minimize user impact
- **Have comprehensive monitoring** and automatic rollback
- **Coordinate with teams** and stakeholders
- **Follow change management** procedures

### How do I measure the success of chaos experiments?
Key metrics include:
- **Resilience score** - Overall system resilience rating
- **Recovery time** - How quickly systems return to normal
- **Error rates** - Impact on user-facing errors
- **Performance metrics** - Response time and throughput impact
- **Business metrics** - Revenue, user experience, SLA compliance

### What happens if an experiment goes wrong?
Harness Chaos Engineering includes multiple safety mechanisms:
- **Automatic rollback** when thresholds are breached
- **Manual stop** capability at any time

## Troubleshooting

### My experiment won't start. What should I check?
Common issues and solutions:
1. **Permissions** - Verify RBAC permissions for target resources
2. **Connectivity** - Check network connectivity to target systems
3. **Resource availability** - Ensure target resources exist and are healthy
4. **Configuration** - Validate experiment configuration and parameters
5. **Dependencies** - Check if required services or tools are running

### Experiments are failing unexpectedly. How do I debug?
Debugging steps:
1. **Check experiment logs** for error messages and details
2. **Verify target system health** before and during experiments
