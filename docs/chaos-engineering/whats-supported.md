## Harness Self-Managed Enterprise Edition

Chaos Engineering on Harness Self-Managed Enterprise Edition is in feature parity with Harness SaaS with the following limitations:
* Harness enterprise chaos hub is not connected by default.
  * Contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io) for access to the Harness enterprise chaos hub. For more information on adding the chaos hub, go to [Add a custom chaos hub](/docs/chaos-engineering/configure-chaos-experiments/chaos-hubs/add-chaos-hub).
* Custom dashboards
* Harness AI Development Assistant (AIDA™) for CE

For more information, go to [Self-Managed Enterprise Edition](/docs/self-managed-enterprise-edition) and [CE on SMP](/docs/chaos-engineering/ce-on-smp/ce-smp-roadmap).

## Harness Self-Managed Enterprise Edition In Offline Environments

All CE features supported in [Harness Self-Managed Enterprise Edition](#harness-self-managed-enterprise-edition) are also supported in Self-Managed Enterprise Edition in offline environments.
