# What's supported

This topic lists the platforms and technologies that Harness Chaos Engineering supports for deploying chaos infrastructure and running chaos experiments.

Harness Chaos Engineering is supported on the following deployment models:
- [Harness SaaS](#harness-saas)
- [Self-Managed Enterprise Edition](#self-managed-enterprise-edition)
- [Self-Managed Enterprise Edition in Offline Environments](#self-managed-enterprise-edition-in-offline-environments)

Harness Chaos Engineering supports running faults on [AWS](/docs/chaos-engineering/faults/chaos-faults/aws/), [Azure](/docs/chaos-engineering/faults/chaos-faults/azure/), [GCP](/docs/chaos-engineering/faults/chaos-faults/gcp/), [Kubernetes](/docs/chaos-engineering/faults/chaos-faults/kubernetes/), [Linux](/docs/chaos-engineering/faults/chaos-faults/linux/), [VMware](/docs/chaos-engineering/faults/chaos-faults/vmware/), and [Windows](/docs/chaos-engineering/faults/chaos-faults/windows/) platforms.

## Harness SaaS

**Harness SaaS** is a fully managed cloud service that provides:
- **Quick setup** - start in minutes
- **Automatic updates** and maintenance
- **Global availability** with 99.9% uptime SLA
- **Enterprise ChaosHub** access included

### Supported Platforms for Chaos Infrastructure

## Self-Managed Enterprise Edition

**Self-Managed Enterprise Edition** provides on-premises deployment with:
- **Full control** over your deployment
- **Enterprise integrations** (LDAP, SSO)
- **Custom security policies** and compliance
- **All SaaS features** in feature parity

### Limitations

Chaos Engineering on Self-Managed Enterprise Edition has the following limitations compared to SaaS:
- **Harness Enterprise ChaosHub** is not connected by default
  - Contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io) for access to the Enterprise ChaosHub
  - Once you have access, you can add it as a [custom ChaosHub](/docs/chaos-engineering/guides/chaoshubs/)
- **Harness AI Development Assistant (AIDA™)** for CE

### Supported Platforms

All platforms and fault categories supported in [Harness SaaS](#harness-saas) are also supported in Self-Managed Enterprise Edition.

For more information about deployment, go to [Self-Managed Enterprise Edition and CE on SMP](/docs/chaos-engineering/guides/on-premises-smp/).

## Self-Managed Enterprise Edition in Offline Environments

**Self-Managed Enterprise Edition in Offline Environments** provides:
- **Completely isolated** from external networks
- **Air-gapped deployment** support
- **All enterprise features** available
- **Custom security policies** and compliance

### Requirements

- **Custom ChaosHub** integration required for fault templates
- **Contact support** for Enterprise ChaosHub access in offline environments

### Supported Platforms

All CE features and platforms supported in [Self-Managed Enterprise Edition](#self-managed-enterprise-edition) are also supported in offline environments.
