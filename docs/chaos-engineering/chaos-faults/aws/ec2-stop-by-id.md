title: EC2 stop by ID
---

EC2 stop by ID stops an EC2 instance using the provided instance ID or list of instance IDs.
- It brings back the instance after a specific duration. 
- It checks the performance of the application (or process) running on the EC2 instance.
- When the `MANAGED_NODEGROUP` environment variable is enabled, the fault will not try to start the instance after chaos. Instead, it checks for the addition of a new node instance to the cluster.

## Usage

<details>
<summary>View fault usage</summary>
<div>
This fault determines the resilience of an application to unexpected halts in the EC2 instance by validating its failover capabilities.
</div>
</details>

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes >= 1.17
- Access to start and stop an EC2 instance in AWS.
- Kubernetes secret that has AWS access configuration(key) in the `CHAOS_NAMESPACE`. Below is the sample secret file.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: cloud-secret
type: Opaque
stringData:
  cloud_config.yml: |-
    # Add the cloud AWS credentials respectively
    [default]
    aws_access_key_id = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    aws_secret_access_key = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

- If you change the secret key name (from `cloud_config.yml`), ensure that you update the `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` environment variable on `experiment.yaml` with the new name.

### WARNING

If the target EC2 instance is a part of a managed node group, drain the target node of any application running on it. Isolate the target node before running the fault so that the fault pods are not scheduled on it.

## Permissions required

Here is an example AWS policy to execute the fault.

<details>
<summary>View policy for the fault</summary>

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:StartInstances",
                "ec2:StopInstances",
                "ec2:DescribeInstanceStatus",
                "ec2:DescribeInstances"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "autoscaling:DescribeAutoScalingInstances"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```
</details>

Refer to the [superset permission/policy](./policy-for-all-aws-faults) to execute all AWS faults.

## Default validations
The EC2 instance should be in a healthy state.

## Fault examples

### Common and AWS-specific tunables

Refer to the [common attributes](../common-tunables-for-all-faults) and [AWS-specific tunables](./aws-fault-tunables) to tune the common tunables for all faults and aws specific tunables.

### Stop Instances By ID

It contains a comma-separated list of instance IDs subjected to EC2 stop chaos. You can tune it using the `EC2_INSTANCE_ID` environment variable.

You can tune it using the following example.

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/ec2-stop-by-id/instance-id.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# contains the instance id, to be terminated/stopped
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: ec2-terminate-by-id
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # ID of the EC2 instance
        - name: EC2_INSTANCE_ID
          value: 'instance-1'
        # region for the EC2 instance
        - name: REGION
          value: 'us-east-1'
```
