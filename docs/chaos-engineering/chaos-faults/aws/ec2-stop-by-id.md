title: EC2 Stop By ID
---

## Introduction

- It causes stopping of an EC2 instance using the provided instance ID or list of instance IDs before bringing it back to running state after the specified chaos duration.
- It helps to check the performance of the application/process running on the EC2 instance.
- When the `MANAGED_NODEGROUP` is enabled then the fault will not try to start the instance post chaos instead it will check of the addition of the new node instance to the cluster.

## Uses

</details>

## Prerequisites

:::info

- Ensure that Kubernetes Version > 1.17
- Access to start and stop an EC2 instance in AWS.
- Kubernetes secret that has AWS access configuration(key) in the `CHAOS_NAMESPACE`. A secret file looks like:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: cloud-secret
type: Opaque
stringData:
  cloud_config.yml: |-
    # Add the cloud AWS credentials respectively
    [default]
    aws_access_key_id = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    aws_secret_access_key = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

- If you change the secret key name (from `cloud_config.yml`), update the `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` environment variable value on `experiment.yaml` with the same name.

### WARNING

If the target EC2 instance is a part of a managed node group, drain the target node of any application running on it. Isolate the target node before running the fault so that the fault pods are not scheduled on it.

## Permission Requirement

- Here is an example AWS policy to execute this fault.

<details>
<summary>View policy for this fault</summary>

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:StartInstances",
                "ec2:StopInstances",
                "ec2:DescribeInstanceStatus",
                "ec2:DescribeInstances"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "autoscaling:DescribeAutoScalingInstances"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```
</details>

- Refer a [superset permission/policy](./policy-for-all-aws-faults) to execute all AWS faults.

## Default Validations

:::info

- The EC2 instance should be in a healthy state.

## Fault Examples

### Common and AWS specific tunables

Refer the [common attributes](../common-tunables-for-all-faults) and [AWS specific tunable](./aws-fault-tunables) to tune the common tunables for all faults and aws specific tunables.

### Stop Instances By ID

It contains comma separated list of instances IDs subjected to EC2 stop chaos. It can be tuned via `EC2_INSTANCE_ID` ENV.

Use the following example to tune this:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/ec2-stop-by-id/instance-id.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# contains the instance id, to be terminated/stopped
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: ec2-terminate-by-id
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # ID of the EC2 instance
        - name: EC2_INSTANCE_ID
          value: 'instance-1'
        # region for the EC2 instance
        - name: REGION
          value: 'us-east-1'
```
