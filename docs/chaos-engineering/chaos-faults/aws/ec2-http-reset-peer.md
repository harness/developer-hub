title: EC2 HTTP reset peer
---

EC2 HTTP reset peer injects HTTP reset on the service whose port is specified using the `TARGET_SERVICE_PORT` environment variable.
- It stops the outgoing HTTP requests by resetting the TCP connection for the requests.
- It determines the application's resilience to a lossy (or flaky) HTTP connection.

## Usage
<details>
<summary>View fault usage</summary>
<div>
It simulates premature connection loss (firewall issues or other issues) between microservices (verify connection timeout), and connection resets due to resource limitations on the server side like out of memory server (or process killed or overload on the server due to a high amount of traffic). 
</div>
</details>


## Prerequisites
- Kubernetes >= 1.17
- SSM agent is installed and running in the target EC2 instance.
- Kubernetes secret with AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key credentials in the `CHAOS_NAMESPACE`. Below is the sample secret file:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: cloud-secret
type: Opaque
stringData:
  cloud_config.yml: |-
    # Add the cloud AWS credentials respectively
    [default]
    aws_access_key_id = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    aws_secret_access_key = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

- It is recommended to use the same secret name, i.e. `cloud-secret`. Otherwise, you will need to update the `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` environment variable in the fault template and you may be unable to use the default health check probes. 

- Refer to [AWS Named Profile For Chaos](./security-Configurations/aws-switch-profile) to know how to use a different profile for AWS faults.

### Note

You can pass the VM credentials as secrets or as an chaosengine environment variable.

## Permissions required

Here is an example AWS policy to execute the fault.

Refer to the [superset permission/policy](./security-Configurations/policy-for-all-aws-faults) to execute all AWS faults.

## Default validations

The EC2 instance should be in a healthy state.

## Fault examples

### Fault tunables

Refer to the [common attributes](../common-tunables-for-all-faults) to tune the common tunables for all the faults.

### Target service port

It is the target service's port being targeted. You can tune it using the `TARGET_SERVICE_PORT` environment variable.

Use the below example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/http-reset-peer/target-service-port.yaml yaml)
```yaml
## provide the port of the targeted service
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: ec2-http-reset-peer
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # provide the port of the targeted service
        - name: TARGET_SERVICE_PORT
          value: "80"
```

### Proxy port

It is the port where the proxy server listens for requests. You can tune it using the `PROXY_PORT` environment variable.

Use the below example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/http-reset-peer/proxy-port.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# provide the port for proxy server
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: ec2-http-reset-peer
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # provide the port for proxy server
        - name: PROXY_PORT
          value: '8080'
        # provide the port of the targeted service
        - name: TARGET_SERVICE_PORT
          value: "80"
```

### Reset timeout

It defines the reset timeout value that is added to the http request. You can tune it using the `RESET_TIMEOUT` environment variable.

Use the below example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/http-reset-peer/reset-timeout.yaml yaml)
```yaml
## provide the reset timeout value
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: ec2-http-reset-peer
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # reset timeout specifies after how much duration to reset the connection
        - name: RESET_TIMEOUT #in ms
          value: '2000'
        # provide the port of the targeted service
        - name: TARGET_SERVICE_PORT
          value: "80"
```

### Toxicity

It defines the toxicity value to be added to the http request. You can tune it using the `TOXICITY` environment variable.
Toxicity value defines the percentage of the total number of http requests that are affected.

Use the below example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/http-reset-peer/toxicity.yaml yaml)
```yaml
## provide the toxicity
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: ec2-http-reset-peer
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # toxicity is the probability of the request that is affected
        # provide the percentage value in the range of 0-100
        # 0 means no request will be affected and 100 means all requests will be affected
        - name: TOXICITY
          value: "100"
        # provide the port of the targeted service
        - name: TARGET_SERVICE_PORT
          value: "80"
```

### Network interface

It defines the network interface used for the proxy. You can tune it using the `NETWORK_INTERFACE` environment variable.

Use the below example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/http-reset-peer/network-interface.yaml yaml)
```yaml
## provide the network interface for proxy
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: ec2-http-reset-peer
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # provide the network interface for proxy
        - name: NETWORK_INTERFACE
          value: "eth0"
        # provide the port of the targeted service
        - name: TARGET_SERVICE_PORT
          value: '80'
```
