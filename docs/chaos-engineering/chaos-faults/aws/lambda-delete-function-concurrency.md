title: Lambda delete function concurrency
---
Lambda delete function concurrency is an AWS fault that:
- Deletes the Lambda function's reserved concurrency, thereby ensuring that the function has adequate unreserved concurrency to run.
- Examines the performance of the running Lambda application, if the Lambda function lacks sufficient concurrency.

## Usage

<details>
<summary>View fault usage</summary>
<div>
When there is no unreserved concurrency left to run the Lambda function, this chaos fault can be used to check how your application behaves.

</div>
</details>

## Prerequisites

:::info

- Kubernetes >= 1.17
- Reserved concurrency set on the target Lambda function.
- Kubernetes secret that has AWS access configuration (key) in the `CHAOS_NAMESPACE`. Below is a sample secret file:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: cloud-secret
type: Opaque
stringData:
  cloud_config.yml: |-
    # Add the cloud AWS credentials respectively
    [default]
    aws_access_key_id = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    aws_secret_access_key = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

- If you change the secret key name (from `cloud_config.yml`), ensure that you update the `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` environment variable in the `experiment.yaml` with the same name.

## Permissions required

- Here is an example AWS policy to execute the Lambda delete function concurrency fault.

<details>
<summary>View policy for this fault</summary>

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "lambda:UpdateFunctionConfiguration",
                "lambda:GetFunctionConcurrency",
                "lambda:GetFunction",
                "lambda:DeleteFunctionConcurrency",
                "lambda:PutFunctionConcurrency"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```
</details>

- Refer to the [superset permission/policy](./policy-for-all-aws-faults) to execute all AWS faults.

## Default validation

:::info

- The Lambda function should be up and running.
