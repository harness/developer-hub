title: EC2 network loss
---

EC2 network loss causes flaky access to the application (or services) by injecting network packet loss to EC2 instance(s). This fault:
- Degrades the network without marking the EC2 instance as unhealthy (or unworthy) of traffic, which is resolved using a middleware that switches traffic based on SLOs (performance parameters).
- May stall the EC2 instance or get corrupted waiting endlessly for a packet. 
- Limits the impact (blast radius) to the traffic that you wish to test, by specifying the IP addresses.

## Use cases
EC2 network loss:
- Determines the performance of the application (or process) running on the EC2 instances.
- Simulates a consistently slow network connection between microservices (for example, cross-region connectivity between active-active peers of a given service or across services or poor cni-performance in the inter-pod-communication network). 
- Simulates jittery connection with transient latency spikes between microservices.
- Simulates a slow response on specific third party (or dependent) components (or services), and degraded data-plane of service-mesh infrastructure.


### Prerequisites
- Kubernetes >= 1.17
- SSM agent is installed and running on the target EC2 instance.
- The EC2 instance should be in a healthy state.
- The Kubernetes secret should have the AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key credentials in the `CHAOS_NAMESPACE`. Below is the sample secret file:
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Secret
  metadata:
    name: cloud-secret
  type: Opaque
  stringData:
    cloud_config.yml: |-
      # Add the cloud AWS credentials respectively
      [default]
      aws_access_key_id = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
      aws_secret_access_key = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
  ```

:::tip
HCE recommends that you use the same secret name, that is, `cloud-secret`. Otherwise, you will need to update the `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` environment variable in the fault template with the new secret name and you won't be able to use the default health check probes.

Below is an example AWS policy to execute the fault.

        {

:::tip
If the environment variables `DESTINATION_HOSTS` or `DESTINATION_IPS` are left empty, the default behaviour is to target all hosts. To limit the impact on all the hosts, you can specify the IP addresses of the service (use commas to separate multiple values) or the DNS or the FQDN names of the services in `DESTINATION_HOSTS`.

### Network packet loss

Network packet loss percentage that is injected on the EC2 instances. Tune it by using the `NETWORK_PACKET_LOSS_PERCENTAGE` environment variable.

The following YAML snippet illustrates the use of this environment variable:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/ec2-network-loss/network-packet-loss-percentage.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# it injects the chaos into the egress traffic
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: ec2-network-loss
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # network packet loss percentage
        - name: NETWORK_PACKET_LOSS_PERCENTAGE
          value: '100'
        - name: EC2_INSTANCE_ID
          value: 'instance-1'
        - name: REGION
          value: 'us-west-2'
```

### Run with destination IPs and destination hosts

Interruption of IPs/hosts. By default, all IPs/hosts are interrupted. Tune specific IPs/hosts by using the `DESTINATION_IPS` and `DESTINATION_HOSTS` environment variables, respectively.

`DESTINATION_IPS`: It contains the IP addresses of the services or the CIDR blocks (range of IPs) whose accessibility is impacted.
`DESTINATION_HOSTS`: It contains the DNS names of the services whose accessibility is impacted.

The following YAML snippet illustrates the use of this environment variable:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/ec2-network-loss/destination-host-and-ip.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# it injects the chaos into the egress traffic for specific IPs/hosts
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: ec2-network-loss
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # supports comma-separated destination ips
        - name: DESTINATION_IPS
          value: '8.8.8.8,192.168.5.6'
        # supports comma-separated destination hosts
        - name: DESTINATION_HOSTS
          value: 'google.com'
        - name: EC2_INSTANCE_ID
          value: 'instance-1'
        - name: REGION
          value: 'us-west-2'
```

###  Network interface

Name of the ethernet interface considered for shaping traffic. Tune it by using the `NETWORK_INTERFACE` environment variable. Its default value is `eth0`.

The following YAML snippet illustrates the use of this environment variable:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/ec2-network-loss/network-interface.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# it injects the chaos into the egress traffic for specific network interface
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: ec2-network-loss
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # name of the network interface
        - name: NETWORK_INTERFACE
          value: 'eth0'
        - name: EC2_INSTANCE_ID
          value: 'instance-1'
        - name: REGION
          value: 'us-west-2'
```
