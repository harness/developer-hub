title: Windows EC2 blackhole chaos
---
Windows EC2 blackhole chaos results in access loss to the given target hosts or IPs by injecting firewall rules. This fault:
- Checks the performance of the application (or process) running on the EC2 instances.

## Use cases

Windows EC2 blackhole chaos:
- Degrades the network without the EC2 instance being marked as unhealthy (or unworthy) of traffic. This can be resolved by using a middleware that switches the traffic based on certain SLOs (performance parameters). 
- Limits the impact, that is, blast radius to only the traffic that you wish to test, by specifying the destination hosts or IP addresses. 

:::note
- Kubernetes > 1.16 is required to execute this fault.
- The EC2 instance should be in a healthy state.
- SSM agent should be installed and running on the target EC2 instance.
- Kubernetes secret should have the AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key credentials in the `CHAOS_NAMESPACE`. Below is a sample secret file:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: cloud-secret
type: Opaque
stringData:
  cloud_config.yml: |-
    # Add the cloud AWS credentials respectively
    [default]
    aws_access_key_id = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    aws_secret_access_key = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

- It is recommended to use the same secret name, that is, `cloud-secret`. Otherwise, you will need to update the `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` environment variable in the fault template and you won't be able to use the default health check probes.

Here is an example AWS policy to execute the fault.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ssm:GetDocument",
                "ssm:DescribeDocument",
                "ssm:GetParameter",
                "ssm:GetParameters",
                "ssm:SendCommand",
                "ssm:CancelCommand",
                "ssm:CreateDocument",
                "ssm:DeleteDocument",
                "ssm:GetCommandInvocation",          
                "ssm:UpdateInstanceInformation",
                "ssm:DescribeInstanceInformation"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2messages:AcknowledgeMessage",
                "ec2messages:DeleteMessage",
                "ec2messages:FailMessage",
                "ec2messages:GetEndpoint",
                "ec2messages:GetMessages",
                "ec2messages:SendReply"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:DescribeInstanceStatus",
                "ec2:DescribeInstances"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}

### Run with destination IPs

It specifies the IPs that interrupt the traffic. Tune it by using the `IP_ADDRESSES` environment variable.

`IP_ADDRESSES`: It contains the IP addresses of the services that are impacted.

Use the following example to tune the IPs:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/windows-ec2-blackhole-chaos/destination-ip.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# it injects the chaos into the egress traffic for specific IPs/hosts
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: windows-ec2-blackhole-chaos
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # supports comma-separated destination ips
        - name: IP_ADDRESSES
          value: '8.8.8.8,192.168.5.6'
        - name: EC2_INSTANCE_ID
          value: 'instance-1'
        - name: REGION
          value: 'us-west-2'
```

### Run with destination hosts

It specifies the hosts that interrupt the traffic by default. Tune it by using the `DESTINATION_HOSTS` environment variable.

`DESTINATION_HOSTS`: It contains the DNS names of the services whose accessibility is impacted.

Use the following example to tune the hosts:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/windows-ec2-blackhole-chaos/destination-host.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# it injects the chaos into the egress traffic for specific IPs/hosts
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: windows-ec2-blackhole-chaos
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # supports comma-separated destination hosts
        - name: DESTINATION_HOSTS
          value: 'google.com'
        - name: EC2_INSTANCE_ID
          value: 'instance-1'
        - name: REGION
          value: 'us-west-2'
```
