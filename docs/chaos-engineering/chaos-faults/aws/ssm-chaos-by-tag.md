title: SSM chaos by tag
---

AWS SSM chaos by tag induces chaos on AWS EC2 instances using the Amazon SSM Run Command.
- It is executed using the SSM document that defines the actions which the systems manager can perform on your managed instances (that have SSM agent installed).
- This SSM document is uploaded beforehand to AWS, whose name is referenced in the faults.
- It helps execute custom chaos (like stress, network, disk or IO) on AWS EC2 instances for a specific duration using the given tag(s).

## Use cases
AWS SSM chaos by tag:
- Tests the resilience of an application that uses custom SSM document as input to execute chaos on EC2 instances.
- Triggers the provided SSM document provided as an input to other AWS chaos.
- After chaos, this fault cleans up the SSM document provided as an input to the EC2 instance.

### Prerequisites
- Kubernetes >= 1.17
- The SSM document should be available in AWS.
- EC2 service update and deployment concepts.
- Authentication is done using [IRSA](/docs/chaos-engineering/chaos-faults/aws/aws-iam-integration#set-up-your-target-accounts-for-irsa) or secret. For secret-based authentication, create a Kubernetes secret that has the AWS access configuration(key) in the `CHAOS_NAMESPACE`. Below is a sample secret file:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: cloud-secret
type: Opaque
stringData:
  cloud_config.yml: |-
    # Add the cloud AWS credentials respectively
    [default]
    aws_access_key_id = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    aws_secret_access_key = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

:::tip
HCE recommends that you use the same secret name, that is, `cloud-secret`. Otherwise, you will need to update the `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` environment variable in the fault template with the new secret name and you won't be able to use the default health check probes.
:::

Below is an example AWS policy to execute the fault.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:DescribeInstances"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ssm:DescribeInstanceInformation",
                "ssm:SendCommand",
                "ssm:GetCommandInvocation",
                "ssm:CancelCommand"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

:::info note
- Refer to [AWS named profile for chaos](./security-configurations/aws-switch-profile.md) to use a different profile for AWS faults.
- The EC2 instance should be in a healthy state before and after introducing chaos.
- Refer to the [common attributes](/docs/chaos-engineering/chaos-faults/common-tunables-for-all-faults.md) and [AWS-specific tunables](./aws-fault-tunables.md) to tune the common tunables for all faults and AWS-specific tunables.
- Refer to the [superset permission/policy](./security-configurations/policy-for-all-aws-faults.md) to execute all AWS faults.

### SSM chaos by tag

Instance tag of the target EC2 instance. Multiple tags can also be provided as a comma-separated values. Provide them in the **key:value** format. Tune it by using the `EC2_INSTANCE_TAG` tag.

The following YAML snippet illustrates the use of this environment variable:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/ssm-chaos-by-tag/instance-tag.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# target the EC2 instances with matching tag
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: ssm-chaos-by-tag
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # tag of the EC2 instance
        - name: EC2_INSTANCE_TAG
          value: 'key:value'
        # region for the EC2 instance
        - name: REGION
          value: 'us-east-1'
```

### SSM chaos by tag on multiple instances

Percentage of EC2 instances to target, based on the `EC2_INSTANCE_TAG` tag and `REGION` region. Tune it by using the `INSTANCE_AFFECTED_PERC` environment variable.

The following YAML snippet illustrates the use of this environment variable:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/smm-chaos-by-tag/instance-affected-percentage.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# percentage of EC2 instances, needs to terminate with provided tags
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: ssm-chaos-by-tag
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # percentage of EC2 instance filtered by tags
        - name: INSTANCE_AFFECTED_PERC
          value: '100'
        # tag of the EC2 instance
        - name: EC2_INSTANCE_TAG
          value: 'key:value'
        # region for the EC2 instance
        - name: REGION
          value: 'us-east-1'
```
