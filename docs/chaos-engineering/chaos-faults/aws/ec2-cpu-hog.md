title: EC2 CPU hog
---

EC2 CPU hog disrupts the state of infrastructure resources. It induces stress on the AWS ECS container using Amazon SSM Run command, which is carried out using SSM docs which is in-built into the fault.
- It causes CPU chaos on the containers of the ECS task using the given `CLUSTER_NAME` environment variable for a specific duration.

## Usage

<details>
<summary>View fault usage</summary>
<div>
The fault causes CPU stress on the target AWS EC2 instance(s). It simulates the situation of lack of CPU for processes running on the application, which degrades their performance. It also helps verify metrics-based horizontal pod autoscaling as well as vertical autoscale, i.e. demand based CPU addition. It helps scalability of nodes based on growth beyond budgeted pods. It verifies the autopilot functionality of (cloud) managed clusters. 
Injecting a rogue process into the target EC2 instance starves the main processes (or applications) (typically pid 1) of the resources allocated to it. This slows down the application traffic or exhausts the resources leading to degradation in performance of processes on the instance. These faults build resilience to such stress cases.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes >= 1.17
- SSM agent is installed and running on the target EC2 instance.
- Create a Kubernetes secret that has the AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key credentials in the `CHAOS_NAMESPACE`. A sample secret file looks like:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: cloud-secret
type: Opaque
stringData:
  cloud_config.yml: |-
    # Add the cloud AWS credentials respectively
    [default]
    aws_access_key_id = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    aws_secret_access_key = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

- If you change the secret key name (from `experiment.yml`), ensure that you update the `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` environment variable in the chaos experiment with the new name.

## Permissions required

Here is an example AWS policy to execute the fault.

Refer to the [superset permission/policy](./policy-for-all-aws-faults) to execute all AWS faults.

## Default validations
The EC2 instance should be in a healthy state.

## Fault examples

### Fault tunables

Refer to the [common attributes](../common-tunables-for-all-faults) to tune the common tunables for all the faults.

### CPU core

It defines the CPU core value to be utilised on the EC2 instance. You can tune it using the `CPU_CORE` environment variable.

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/ec2-cpu-hog/cpu-core.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# CPU cores to utilize
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: ec2-cpu-hog
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        - name: CPU_CORE
          VALUE: '2'
        # ID of the EC2 instance
        - name: EC2_INSTANCE_ID
          value: 'instance-1'
        # region for the EC2 instance
        - name: REGION
          value: 'us-east-1'
```

### CPU percentage

It defines the CPU percentage value to be utilised on the EC2 instance. You can tune it using the `CPU_LOAD` environment variable.

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/ec2-cpu-hog/cpu-percentage.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# CPU percentage to utilize
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: ec2-cpu-hog
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        - name: CPU_LOAD
          VALUE: '50'
        # ID of the EC2 instance
        - name: EC2_INSTANCE_ID
          value: 'instance-1'
        # region for the EC2 instance
        - name: REGION
          value: 'us-east-1'
```

### Multiple EC2 instances

Multiple EC2 instances can be targeted in one chaos run. You can tune it using the `EC2_INSTANCE_ID` environment variable.

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/ec2-cpu-hog/multiple-instances.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# mutilple instance targets
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: ec2-cpu-hog
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # ids of the EC2 instances
        - name: EC2_INSTANCE_ID
          value: 'instance-1,instance-2,instance-3'
        # region for the EC2 instance
        - name: REGION
          value: 'us-east-1'
```

### CPU core with percentage consumption

It defines how many CPU cores to utilise with percentage of utilisation on the EC2 instance. You can tune it using the `CPU_CORE` and `CPU_LOAD` environment variables, respectively.

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/ec2-cpu-hog/cpu-core-with-percentage.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# CPU core with percentage to utilize
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: ec2-cpu-hog
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        - name: CPU_CORE
          VALUE: '2'
        - name: CPU_LOAD
          VALUE: '50'
        # ID of the EC2 instance
        - name: EC2_INSTANCE_ID
          value: 'instance-1'
        # region for the EC2 instance
        - name: REGION
          value: 'us-east-1'
```
