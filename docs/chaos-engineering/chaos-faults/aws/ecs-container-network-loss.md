title: ECS Container Network Loss
---

## Introduction

- ECS Container Network Loss contains chaos to disrupt the state of infra resources. The fault can induce chaos on AWS ECS container using SSM Run Command, this is carried out by using SSM Docs which is in-built in the fault for the give chaos scenario.

- It Inject network packet loss on the target task container for the given destination host(s), IP(s) OR all hosts. The extent of packet loss can be specified using an input (packet loss percentage). 100% will mean complete loss of connectivity.

- To select the Task Under Chaos (TUC) you can make use of servie name associated with the task that is - if you provide the service name along with cluster name only all the tasks associated with the given service will be selected as chaos targets.

- It tests the ECS task sanity (service availability) and recovery of the task containers subjected to network chaos.

## Uses

<details>
<summary>View the uses of the fault</summary>
<div>
The fault causes network degradation of the task container without the container being marked unhealthy/unworthy of traffic from outside. The idea of this fault is to simulate issues within your ECS task network OR communication across services in different availability zones/regions etc.

Mitigation (in this case keep the timeout i.e., network loss value low) could be via some middleware that can switch traffic based on some SLOs/perf parameters. If such an arrangement is not available the next best thing would be to verify if such a degradation is highlighted via notification/alerts etc,. so the admin/SRE has the opportunity to investigate and fix things. Another utility of the test would be to see what the extent of impact caused to the end-user OR the last point in the app stack on account of degradation in access to a downstream/dependent microservice. Whether it is acceptable OR breaks the system to an unacceptable degree. The fault provides NETWORK_PACKET_LOSS_PERCENTAGE so that you can control the chaos against specific services within or outside the cluster.

The task may stall or get corrupted while they wait endlessly for a packet. The fault limits the impact (blast radius) to only the traffic you want to test by specifying service to find TUC (Task Under Chaos). This fault will help to improve the resilience of your services over time.

## Prerequisites

:::info

- Ensure that Kubernetes Version >= 1.17

<details>
<summary>Enable Container Metadata</summary>

Ensure that the ECS container metadata is <code>enabled</code>;this feature is <code>disabled</code> by default. Refer AWS docs - <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/container-metadata.html">Enabling container metadata</a>. This will allow HCE to know the container details like containerID that is running the ECS tasks.

<b>NOTE:</b> You need to do the following steps to enable container metadata and attach IAM role to the cluster instances:

- In the EC2 dashboard sidebar click on Launch Configurations under Auto Scaling.

![autoscaling-config](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35391335/207263427-559bd2cb-f0f1-478c-badd-90d8ec0dace7.png)

- Create a copy of autoscaling configuration used in target ECS cluster. This will create a new (copied) Launch Template.

![create-copy-of-lc](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35391335/207265148-421ed263-434d-48a5-a5fc-7be0bb0d859e.png)

- In the new(copied) Launch Template, update the IAM role of the instances with ECS-SSM permissions (as shown in below permission requirement section).

![iam-instance-profile](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35391335/207267931-c5bad3a2-b57b-4587-a3c0-a26829eec52f.png)

- Now update the user data with <code>ECS_ENABLE_CONTAINER_METADATA</code> to be <code>true</code> as shown below.

![user-data](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35391335/207268623-cac27c20-b03d-4739-9770-9b64953ccbf3.png)

- Now save the launch configuration by clicking on â€˜Create Launch Template'.

![create-launch-config](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35391335/207270515-2c0b194c-2d74-4b3d-bcb6-d41df25db881.png)

- Now go back to auto scaling group and switch to launch template (as launch configuration is deprecating by AWS).

![switch-to-launch-template](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35391335/207272155-79c63a17-bbf1-4b3f-a34c-e6808b0944e9.png)

- Update the cluster auto-scaling group with the newer launch template.

![update-launch-config](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35391335/207272408-27b1562d-2bcb-478d-90ac-5c702fb6b548.png)

- Restart the instances of the ECS cluster to pull the updated configuration:

![restart-instances](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35391335/206241766-6c684660-89f9-4868-b0ff-88d0409304bc.png)

</details>

- Ensure both user and ECS cluster instances have a Role with required AWS access to do SSM and ECS operations. Refer the below mentioned sample policy for the fault.
- Ensure to create a Kubernetes secret having the AWS access configuration(key) in the `CHAOS_NAMESPACE`. A sample secret file looks like:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: cloud-secret
type: Opaque
stringData:
  cloud_config.yml: |-
    # Add the cloud AWS credentials respectively
    [default]
    aws_access_key_id = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    aws_secret_access_key = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

- If you change the secret key name (from `cloud_config.yml`) please also update the `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` ENV value in the ChaosExperiment CR with the same name.

## Fault Examples

### Common and AWS specific tunables

Refer the [common attributes](../common-tunables-for-all-faults) and [AWS specific tunable](./aws-fault-tunables) to tune the common tunables for all faults and aws specific tunables.

### Network loss

It defines the network loss(in ms) to be injected in the targeted container. It can be tuned via `NETWORK_PACKET_LOSS_PERCENTAGE` ENV.

Use the following example to tune this:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/ecs-network-chaos/network-loss.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# injects network loss for a certain chaos duration
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: ecs-container-network-loss
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # network loss to be injected
        - name: NETWORK_PACKET_LOSS_PERCENTAGE
          value: '100' #in ms
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          value: '60'
```

### Network Interface

The defined name of the ethernet interface, which is considered for shaping traffic. It can be tuned via `NETWORK_INTERFACE` ENV. Its default value is `eth0`.

Use the following example to tune this:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/ecs-network-chaos/loss-network-interface.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# provide the network interface
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: ecs-container-network-loss
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # name of the network interface
        - name: NETWORK_INTERFACE
          value: 'eth0'
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          value: '60'
```


### Destination IPs And Destination Hosts

The network faults interrupt traffic for all the IPs/hosts by default. The interruption of specific IPs/Hosts can be tuned via `DESTINATION_IPS` and `DESTINATION_HOSTS` ENV.

- `DESTINATION_IPS`: It contains the IP addresses of the services or pods or the CIDR blocks(range of IPs), the accessibility to which is impacted.
- `DESTINATION_HOSTS`: It contains the DNS Names/FQDN names of the services, the accessibility to which, is impacted.

Use the following example to tune this:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/ecs-network-chaos/loss-destination-ip-and-hosts.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# it inject the chaos for the egress traffic for specific ips/hosts
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: ecs-container-network-loss
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # supports comma separated destination ips
        - name: DESTINATION_IPS
          value: '8.8.8.8,192.168.5.6'
        # supports comma separated destination hosts
        - name: DESTINATION_HOSTS
          value: 'nginx.default.svc.cluster.local,google.com'
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          value: '60'
```
