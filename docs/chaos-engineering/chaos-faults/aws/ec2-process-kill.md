title: EC2 Process Kill
---

## Introduction
- EC2 Process Kill fault kills the target processes running on EC2 instance to determine the application/process resilience.
- It helps to check the performance of the application/process running on the EC2 instance(s).

## Uses
<details>
<summary>View the uses of the fault</summary>
<div>
Disrupt the application critical processes such as databases or message queues running in the EC2 instance by killing their underlying processes or threads.
</div>
</details>

## Prerequisites
:::info
- Ensure that Kubernetes Version > 1.17
- Ensure that SSM agent is installed and running in the target EC2 instance.
- Ensure to create a Kubernetes secret having the AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key credentials in the `CHAOS_NAMESPACE`. A sample secret file looks like:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: cloud-secret
type: Opaque
stringData:
  cloud_config.yml: |-
    # Add the cloud AWS credentials respectively
    [default]
    aws_access_key_id = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    aws_secret_access_key = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

- If you change the secret name then please also update the `experiment.yml` ENV values for deriving the respective data from the secret. Also account for the path at which this secret is mounted as a file in the manifest ENV `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE`.

### NOTE
You can pass the VM credentials as secrets or as an ChaosEngine ENV variable.

## Permission Requirement

- Here is an example AWS policy to execute ec2-process-kill fault.

                "ec2messages:GetEndpoint",
                "ec2messages:GetMessages",
                "ec2messages:SendReply"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:DescribeInstanceStatus",
                "ec2:DescribeInstances"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
</details>

- Refer a [superset permission/policy](./policy-for-all-aws-faults) to execute all AWS faults.

## Default Validations
:::info
- EC2 instance should be in healthy state
- The target processes should exist in the VM.

## Fault Examples

### Common Fault Tunables
Refer the [common attributes](../common-tunables-for-all-faults) to tune the common tunables for all the faults.

### PROCESS_IDS
It contains the target process Ids running on a particular EC2 instance


Use the following example to tune this:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/ec2-process-kill/ec2-process-kill-processid.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# Process kill running on EC2 instance
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: ec2-process-kill
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # List of Process IDs
        - name: PROCESS_IDS
          value: '8688,4678'
        - name: EC2_INSTANCE_ID
          value: 'instance-1'
        - name: REGION
          value: 'us-west-2'
```
