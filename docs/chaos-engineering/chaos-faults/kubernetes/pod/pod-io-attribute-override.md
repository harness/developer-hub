import IOFaultsCaution from './shared/io-faults-caution.md'

Pod IO attribute override modifies the properties of files located within the mounted volume of the pod.
This fault should be used as a sanity test for validating your application's failover capability against unexpected changes in file attributes, such as permissions, ownership, or timestamps.

## Use cases
Pod IO attribute override:
- Tests whether your application is able to detect and respond to unexpected changes in file attributes, which can help you ensure that your system remains compliant and secure.
- Tests whether your disaster recovery system is able to restore files and maintain file attributes correctly.
- Tests whether your backup system is able to restore files and maintain file attributes correctly.
- Tests whether your change management process is able to detect and respond to unexpected changes in file attributes, which can help you ensure that your system remains stable and secure.

  definition:
    scope: Cluster # Supports "Namespaced" mode too

### Attributes

Modify the properties of files located within the mounted volume of the pod. Tune it by using the `ATTRIBUTES` environment variable. 

The following YAML snippet illustrates the use of this environment variable:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/pod-io-attribute-override/attributes.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# it overrides the file attributes
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  appinfo:
    appns: "default"
    applabel: "app=nginx"
    appkind: "deployment"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: pod-io-attribute-override
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # file attributes
        - name: ATTRIBUTES
          value: '{"perm": 72}'
        - name: MOUNT_PATH
          value: '/etc/config'
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          value: '60'
```

### Mount path

Mount path of the volume mounted to the target application. Tune it by using the `MOUNT_PATH` environment variable.

The following YAML snippet illustrates the use of this environment variable:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/pod-io-attribute-override/mount-path.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# it overrides the file attributes
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  appinfo:
    appns: "default"
    applabel: "app=nginx"
    appkind: "deployment"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: pod-io-attribute-override
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # mount path of the volume
        - name: MOUNT_PATH
          value: '/etc/config'
        - name: ATTRIBUTES
          value: '{"perm": 72}'
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          value: '60'
```

### Advanced fault tunables

- `FILE_PATH`: The path for injecting faults can be specified as either a single file or a wildcard. By default it targets all the files present inside the mount path.
- `PERCENTAGE`: The likelihood of failure per operation, expressed as a percentage. Default is 100%.
- `METHOD_TYPES`: This contains the file system call or methods. By default it targets all the methods.

The following YAML snippet illustrates the use of this environment variable:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/pod-io-attribute-override/advanced-fault-tunables.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# it overrides the file attributes
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  appinfo:
    appns: "default"
    applabel: "app=nginx"
    appkind: "deployment"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: pod-io-attribute-override
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # filter the target files
        - name: FILE_PATH
          value: '/etc/config/file.txt'
        # percentage of i/o calls
        - name: PERCENTAGE
          value: '50'
        # names of the io methods
        - name: METHOD_TYPES
          value: '["read","write"]'
        - name: ATTRIBUTES
          value: '{"perm": 72}'
        - name: MOUNT_PATH
          value: '/etc/config'
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          value: '60'
```

### Container runtime and socket path

The `CONTAINER_RUNTIME` and `SOCKET_PATH` environment variables to set the container runtime and socket file path, respectively.

- `CONTAINER_RUNTIME`: This supports `docker`, `containerd`, and `crio` runtimes. The default value is `containerd`.
- `SOCKET_PATH`: This contains the path of containerd socket file by default(`/run/containerd/containerd.sock`). For `docker`, specify the path as `/var/run/docker.sock`. For `crio`, specify the path as `/var/run/crio/crio.sock`.

The following YAML snippet illustrates the use of these environment variables:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/pod-io-attribute-override/container-runtime-and-socket-path.yaml yaml)
```yaml
## provide the container runtime and socket file path
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  appinfo:
    appns: "default"
    applabel: "app=nginx"
    appkind: "deployment"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: pod-io-attribute-override
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # runtime for the container
        # supports docker, containerd, crio
        - name: CONTAINER_RUNTIME
          value: 'containerd'
        # path of the socket file
        - name: SOCKET_PATH
          value: '/run/containerd/containerd.sock'
        - name: ATTRIBUTES
          value: '{"perm": 72}'
        - name: MOUNT_PATH
          value: '/etc/config'
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          VALUE: '60'
```
