Pod delete is a Kubernetes pod-level chaos fault that causes specific (or random) replicas of an application resource to fail forcibly (or gracefully).
- To ensure smooth usage, applications must have a minimum number of available replicas.
- When the pressure on other replicas increases, the horizontal pod autoscaler scales based on the observed resource utilization.

## Use cases

Pod delete:
- Helps check the application's deployment sanity (replica availability and uninterrupted service) and recovery workflow.
- Can be used to verify:
  - Disk (or volume) re-attachment times in stateful applications.
  - Application start-up times, and readiness probe configuration (health endpoints and delays).
  - Adherence to topology constraints (node selectors, toleration, zone distribution, and affinity (or anti-affinity) policies).
  - Proxy registration times in service-mesh environments.
  - Post (lifecycle) hooks and termination seconds configuration for the microservices (under active load)- that is, graceful termination handling.
  - Resource budgeting on cluster nodes (whether request or limit settings are honored on available nodes for successful schedule).
- Simulates:
  - Graceful delete, or rescheduling, of pods as a result of upgrades.
  - Forced deletion of pods as a result of eviction.
  - Leader-election in complex applications.

### Permissions required

Below is a sample Kubernetes role that defines the permissions required to execute the fault.

```
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: hce
  name: pod-delete
spec:
  definition:
    scope: Cluster # Supports "Namespaced" mode too
permissions:
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["pods"]
    verbs: ["create", "delete", "get", "list", "patch", "deletecollection", "update"]
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["events"]
    verbs: ["create", "get", "list", "patch", "update"]
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["pods/log"]
    verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["deployments, statefulsets"]
    verbs: ["get", "list"]
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["replicasets, daemonsets"]
    verbs: ["get", "list"]

### Force delete

Specifies if the target pod is deleted `forcefully` or `gracefully`. This fault deletes the pod forcefully if `FORCE` is set to `true` and gracefully if `FORCE` is set to `false`. Tune it by using the `FORCE` environment variable.

The following YAML snippet illustrates the use of this environment variable:

[embedmd]: # "./static/manifests/pod-delete/force.yaml yaml"

```yaml
# tune the deletion of target pods forcefully or gracefully
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  appinfo:
    appns: "default"
    applabel: "app=nginx"
    appkind: "deployment"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
    - name: pod-delete
      spec:
        components:
          env:
            # provided as true for the force deletion of pod
            # supports true and false value
            - name: FORCE
              value: "true"
            - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
              value: "60"
```

### Random interval

Specifies whether or not to enable randomness in the chaos interval by setting `RANDOMNESS` environment variable to `true`. It supports boolean values. The default value is `false`. Tune it by using the `CHAOS_INTERVAL` environment variable.

- If `CHAOS_INTERVAL` is set in the form of `l-r` that is, `5-10` then it will select a random interval between l and r.
- If `CHAOS_INTERVAL` is set in the form of `value` that is, `10` then it will select a random interval between 0 and value.

The following YAML snippet illustrates the use of this environment variable:

[embedmd]: # "./static/manifests/pod-delete/randomness-interval.yaml yaml"

```yaml
# contains random chaos interval with lower and upper bound of range i.e [l,r]
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  appinfo:
    appns: "default"
    applabel: "app=nginx"
    appkind: "deployment"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
    - name: pod-delete
      spec:
        components:
          env:
            # randomness enables iterations at random time interval
            # it supports true and false value
            - name: RANDOMNESS
              value: "true"
            - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
              value: "60"
            # it will select a random interval within this range
            # if only one value is provided then it will select a random interval within 0-CHAOS_INTERVAL range
            - name: CHAOS_INTERVAL
              value: "5-10"
```
