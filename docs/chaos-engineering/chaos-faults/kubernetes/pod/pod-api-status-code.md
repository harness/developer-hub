Pod API status code is a Kubernetes pod-level chaos fault that change the API response status code and optionally api response body through path filtering. This is achieved by starting the proxy server and redirecting the traffic through the proxy server.

![Pod API Status Code](./static/images/pod-api-status-code.png)

## Use cases
Pod API status code:
- It can be used to test the error handling capabilities of API and client applications. By changing the API response status code to different error codes, such as 400 (Bad Request) or 500 (Internal Server Error), you can evaluate how well your application handles and responds to various error scenarios.
- Simulates situations where the API may be temporarily unavailable or rate-limited by returning temporary error codes like 503 (Service Unavailable) or 429 (Too Many Requests).
- It can be used for content filtering, by selectively filter or block certain responses. For example, you can change the status code to 404 (Not Found) for specific paths or patterns, indicating that the requested resource does not exist.

### Permissions required

Below is a sample Kubernetes role that defines the permissions required to execute the fault.

```
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: hce
  name: pod-api-status-code
spec:
  definition:
    scope: Cluster # Supports "Namespaced" mode too
permissions:
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["pods"]
    verbs: ["create", "delete", "get", "list", "patch", "deletecollection", "update"]
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["events"]
    verbs: ["create", "get", "list", "patch", "update"]
  - apiGroups: [""]

  - apiGroups: ["batch"]
    resources: ["jobs"]
    verbs: ["create", "delete", "get", "list", "deletecollection"]
```

### Prerequisites
- Kubernetes> 1.17
- The application pods should be in the running state before and after injecting chaos.

The following YAML snippet illustrates the use of this environment variable:

[embedmd]: # "./static/manifests/pod-api-status-code/destination-ports.yaml yaml"

```yaml
## provide destination ports
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1

              value: '80,443'
            # provide the api path filter
            - name: PATH_FILTER
              value: '/status'
            # provide the status code

            - name: TARGET_SERVICE_PORT
              value: "80"
```

### HTTPS

Enable the HTTPS support for both incoming and outgoing traffic by setting the `HTTPS_ENABLED` field to `true`. Its usage varies depending on whether it's applied to `ingress` or `egress` scenarios.

#### Ingress

Set this parameter if the HTTPS URL of the target application includes a port, formatted as `https://<hostname>:port`. However, if the HTTPS URL is in the format `https://<hostname>` without a port, this setting is not required.

#### Egress

For outbound traffic, setting `HTTPS_ENABLED` to `true` is required to enable HTTPS support for external services. This enables the establishment of TLS certificates for the proxy within the target application.

* If the HTTP client in the target application is configured to reload certificates with each API call, set `HTTPS_ENABLED` to `true`, and there's no need to provide `CUSTOM_CERTIFICATES`. However, if the root certificate directory and file name differ from `/etc/ssl/certs` and `ca-certificates.crt` respectively, set the root certificate directory path using the `HTTPS_ROOT_CERT_PATH` ENV variable and the file name using the `HTTPS_ROOT_CERT_FILE_NAME` ENV variable.
* If the HTTP client in the target application isn't configured to reload certificates with each API call, you must provide the `CUSTOM_CERTIFICATES` ENV variable to the chaos experiment and no need to set `HTTPS_ROOT_CERT_PATH` and `HTTPS_ROOT_CERT_FILE_NAME` ENV. The same custom certificates should be loaded into the target application. You can generate custom certificates using the following commands:
   ```bash
   openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.crt -days 365 -nodes -subj '/CN=*'
   cat key.pem cert.crt > ca-cert.pem
   cat ca-cert.pem | base64 # provide it inside the CUSTOM_CERTIFICATES ENV
   ```
  Load the `cert.crt` into the target application and provide the base64 encoded value of ca-cert.pem to the `CUSTOM_CERTIFICATES` ENV variable.

The following YAML snippet illustrates the use of this environment variable:

[embedmd]: # "./static/manifests/pod-api-status-code/https-enabled.yaml yaml"

```yaml
## enable https support
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  appinfo:
    appns: "default"
    applabel: "app=nginx"
    appkind: "deployment"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
    - name: pod-api-status-code
      spec:
        components:
          env:
            # enable https support
            - name: HTTPS_ENABLED
              value: 'true'
            - name: CUSTOM_CERTIFICATES
              value: 'Y3VzdG9tIGNlcnRpZmljYXRlcwo='
            # provide the api path filter
            - name: PATH_FILTER
              value: '/status'
            # provide the port of the targeted service
            - name: TARGET_SERVICE_PORT
              value: "80"
```

### Advanced fault tunables

- `PROXY_PORT`: Port where the proxy listens for requests and responses.
- `SERVICE_DIRECTION`: Direction of the flow of control, either ingress or egress. It supports `ingress`, `egress` values.
- `DATA_DIRECTION`: API payload type, request, or response. It supports `request`, `response`, and `both` values.
- `NETWORK_INTERFACE`: Network interface used for the proxy.
- `RESPONSE_BODY`: It can be used to override the response body. It should be provided in `/<regex>/<replacement>` format. If not provided, it will return the original response body.

The following YAML snippet illustrates the use of this environment variable:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/pod-api-status-code/advanced-fault-tunables.yaml yaml)

              value: 'ingress'
            # provide the payload type
            - name: DATA_DIRECTION
              value: 'both'
            # provide the network interface
            - name: NETWORK_INTERFACE
              value: 'eth0'
            # provide the api path filter
            - name: PATH_FILTER
              value: '/status'
            # provide the port of the targeted service
            - name: TARGET_SERVICE_PORT
              value: "80"
            - name: STATUS_CODE
              value: "500"
            - name: RESPONSE_BODY
              value: '/.+/test'

```

### Advanced filters

- `HEADERS_FILTERS`: The HTTP request headers filters, that accept multiple comma-separated headers in the format of `key1:value1,key2:value2`.
- `METHODS`: The HTTP request method type filters, that accept comma-separated HTTP methods in upper case, that is, `GET,POST`.
- `QUERY_PARAMS`: The HTTP request query parameters filter, accepts multiple comma-separated query parameters in the format of `param1:value1,param2:value2`.
- `SOURCE_HOSTS`: Comma-separated source host names filters, indicating the origin of the HTTP request. This is relevant to the `ingress` type, specified by `SERVICE_DIRECTION` environment variable.
- `SOURCE_IPS`: Comma-separated source IPs filters, indicating the origin of the HTTP request. This is specifically relevant to the `ingress` type, specified by `SERVICE_DIRECTION` environment variable.
- `DESTINATION_HOSTS`: Comma-separated destination host names filters, indicating the hosts on which you call the API. This specification applies exclusively to the `egress` type, specified by `SERVICE_DIRECTION` environment variable.
- `DESTINATION_IPS`: Comma-separated destination IPs filters, indicating the hosts on which you call the API. This specification applies exclusively to the `egress` type, specified by `SERVICE_DIRECTION` environment variable.

  annotationCheck: "false"
  appinfo:
    appns: "default"
    applabel: "app=nginx"
    appkind: "deployment"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
    - name: pod-api-status-code
      spec:
        components:
          env:
            # provide the headers filters
            - name: HEADERS_FILTERS
              value: 'key1:value1,key2:value2'
            # provide the methods filters
            - name: METHODS
              value: 'GET,POST'
            # provide the query params filters
            - name: QUERY_PARAMS
              value: 'param1:value1,param2:value2'
            # provide the source hosts filters
            - name: SOURCE_HOSTS
              value: 'host1,host2'
            # provide the source ips filters
            - name: SOURCE_IPS
              value: 'ip1,ip2'
            # provide the connection type
            - name: SERVICE_DIRECTION
              value: 'ingress'
            # provide the port of the targeted service
            - name: TARGET_SERVICE_PORT

### Container runtime and socket path

The `CONTAINER_RUNTIME` and `SOCKET_PATH` environment variable to set the container runtime and socket file path, respectively.

- `CONTAINER_RUNTIME`: It supports `docker`, `containerd`, and `crio` runtimes. The default value is `containerd`.
- `SOCKET_PATH`: It contains path of containerd socket file by default(`/run/containerd/containerd.sock`). For `docker`, specify path as `/var/run/docker.sock`. For `crio`, specify path as `/var/run/crio/crio.sock`.

The following YAML snippet illustrates the use of these environment variables:

            - name: CONTAINER_RUNTIME
              value: "containerd"
            # path of the socket file
            - name: SOCKET_PATH
              value: "/run/containerd/containerd.sock"
            # provide the port of the targeted service
            - name: TARGET_SERVICE_PORT
              value: "80"
            # provide the api path filter
            - name: PATH_FILTER
              value: '/status'
            - name: STATUS_CODE
              value: "500"
