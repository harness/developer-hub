Pod HTTP latency is a Kubernetes pod-level chaos fault that injects HTTP response latency by starting the proxy server and redirecting the traffic through it. This fault:
- Injects the latency into the service whose port is specified using the `TARGET_SERVICE_PORT` environment variable.

## Use cases
Pod HTTP latency:
- Evaluates the application's resilience to lossy or flaky HTTP responses.
- Simulates latency to specific API services for (or from) a given microservice.
- Simulates a slow response on specific third-party or dependent components or services.

### Permissions required

Below is a sample Kubernetes role that defines the permissions required to execute the fault.

```
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: hce
  name: pod-http-latency
spec:
  definition:
    scope: Cluster # Supports "Namespaced" mode too
permissions:
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["pods"]
    verbs: ["create", "delete", "get", "list", "patch", "deletecollection", "update"]
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["events"]
    verbs: ["create", "get", "list", "patch", "update"]
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["pods/log"]
    verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["deployments, statefulsets"]
    verbs: ["get", "list"]

    resources: ["jobs"]
    verbs: ["create", "delete", "get", "list", "deletecollection"]
```

### Prerequisites
- Kubernetes > 1.16
- The application pods should be in the running state before and after injecting chaos.

### Container runtime and socket path

The `CONTAINER_RUNTIME` and `SOCKET_PATH` environment variables to set the container runtime and socket file path, respectively.

- `CONTAINER_RUNTIME`: It supports `docker`, `containerd`, and `crio` runtimes. The default value is `containerd`.
- `SOCKET_PATH`: It contains path of containerd socket file by default(`/run/containerd/containerd.sock`). For `docker`, specify path as `/var/run/docker.sock`. For `crio`, specify path as `/var/run/crio/crio.sock`.

The following YAML snippet illustrates the use of these environment variables:

[embedmd]: # "./static/manifests/pod-http-latency/container-runtime-and-socket-path.yaml yaml"

```yaml
## provide the container runtime and socket file path
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"

    appns: "default"
    applabel: "app=nginx"

            # supports docker, containerd, crio
            - name: CONTAINER_RUNTIME
              value: "containerd"
            # path of the socket file
            - name: SOCKET_PATH
              value: "/run/containerd/containerd.sock"
            # provide the port of the targeted service
            - name: TARGET_SERVICE_PORT
              value: "80"
