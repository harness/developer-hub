Node CPU hog exhausts the CPU resources on a Kubernetes node.
- The CPU chaos is injected using a helper pod running the Linux stress tool (a workload generator).
- The chaos affects the application for a specific duration.

## Use cases
- Node CPU hog fault helps verify the resilience of applications whose replicas get evicted on the account of the nodes turning unschedulable (in **NotReady** state) or new replicas unable to be scheduled due to a lack of CPU resources.
- It causes CPU stress on the target node(s).
- It simulates the situation of lack of CPU for processes running on the application, which degrades their performance.
- It also helps verify metrics-based horizontal pod autoscaling as well as vertical autoscale, that is, demand based CPU addition.
- It helps scalability of nodes based on growth beyond budgeted pods.
- It verifies the autopilot functionality of cloud managed clusters.
- It also verifies multi-tenant load issues; that is, when the load increases on one container, it does not cause downtime in other containers.

### Permissions required

Below is a sample Kubernetes role that defines the permissions required to execute the fault.

```
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: hce
  name: node-cpu-hog
spec:
  definition:
    scope: Cluster
permissions:
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["pods"]
    verbs: ["create", "delete", "get", "list", "patch", "deletecollection", "update"]
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["events"]
    verbs: ["create", "get", "list", "patch", "update"]
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["chaosEngines", "chaosExperiments", "chaosResults"]
    verbs: ["create", "delete", "get", "list", "patch", "update"]
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["pods/log"]
    verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["pods/exec"]
    verbs: ["get", "list", "create"]
  - apiGroups: ["batch"]
    resources: ["jobs"]
    verbs: ["create", "delete", "get", "list", "deletecollection"]
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["nodes"]
    verbs: ["get", "list"]
```

### Prerequisites
- Kubernetes > 1.16 is required to execute this fault.
- The target nodes should be in the ready state before and after injecting chaos.

### Node CPU cores
Number of cores of CPU that will be consumed. Tune it by using the `NODE_CPU_CORE` environment variable.

The following YAML snippet illustrates the use of this environment variable:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/node-cpu-hog/node-cpu-core.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# stress the CPU of the targeted nodes
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: node-cpu-hog
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # number of CPU cores to be stressed
        - name: NODE_CPU_CORE
          value: '2'
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          VALUE: '60'
```

### Node CPU load

Percentage of CPU that will be consumed. Tune it by using the `CPU_LOAD` environment variable.

The following YAML snippet illustrates the use of this environment variable:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/node-cpu-hog/node-cpu-load.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# stress the CPU of the targeted nodes by load percentage
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: node-cpu-hog
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # percentage of CPU to be stressed
        - name: CPU_LOAD
          value: "100"
        # node CPU core should be provided as 0 for CPU load
        # to work otherwise it will take CPU core as priority
        - name: NODE_CPU_CORE
          value: '0'
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          VALUE: '60'
```
