title: Node CPU hog
---
Node CPU hog exhausts the CPU resources on a Kubernetes node. 
- The CPU chaos is injected using a helper pod running the Linux stress tool (a workload generator). 
- The chaos affects the application for a period defined by the `TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION` environment variable.

## Usage
<details>
<summary>View the uses of the fault</summary>
<div>
The fault aims to verify the resiliency of applications whose replicas may be evicted on account of nodes turning unschedulable (Not Ready) or new replicas not being able to schedule due to a lack of CPU resources.
The fault causes CPU stress on the target node(s). It simulates the situation of lack of CPU for processes running on the application, which degrades their performance. It also helps verify metrics-based horizontal pod autoscaling as well as vertical autoscale, i.e. demand based CPU addition. It helps scalability of nodes based on growth beyond budgeted pods. It verifies the autopilot functionality of (cloud) managed clusters. 
It benefits include verifying multi-tenant load issues (when the load increases on one container, it does not cause downtime in other containers).

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes > 1.16.


## Default validations

The target nodes should be in the ready state before and after injecting chaos.

## Fault examples

### Common and node-specific tunables
Refer to the [common attributes](../../common-tunables-for-all-faults) and [node-specific tunables](./common-tunables-for-node-faults) to tune the common tunables for all faults and node specific tunables.

### Node CPU cores
It contains the number of cores of CPU that will be consumed. You can tune it using the `NODE_CPU_CORE` environment variable.

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/node-cpu-hog/node-cpu-core.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# stress the CPU of the targeted nodes
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: node-cpu-hog
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # number of CPU cores to be stressed
        - name: NODE_CPU_CORE
          value: '2'
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          VALUE: '60'
```

### Node CPU load

It contains the percentage of CPU that will be consumed. You can tune it using the `CPU_LOAD` environment variable.

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/node-cpu-hog/node-cpu-load.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# stress the CPU of the targeted nodes by load percentage
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: node-cpu-hog
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # percentage of CPU to be stressed
        - name: CPU_LOAD
          value: "100"
        # node CPU core should be provided as 0 for CPU load
        # to work otherwise it will take CPU core as priority
        - name: NODE_CPU_CORE
          value: '0'
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          VALUE: '60'
```
