Node network loss is a Kubernetes node-level chaos fault that induces packet loss across the entire node. Similar to pod network loss, this fault uses traffic control (tc) along with netem rules to inject network loss.

![Node Network Loss](./static/images/node-network-loss.png)

## Use cases
Node network loss:
- Simulates a degraded network at the node level, causing potential disruptions to all pods running on the affected node.
- Tests the node and inter-node communication resilience against packet loss.
- Simulates scenarios where specific nodes might experience network problems due to issues like faulty NICs or network misconfigurations.

### Permissions required

Below is a sample Kubernetes role that defines the permissions required to execute the fault.

```
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: hce
  name: node-network-loss
spec:
  definition:
    scope: Cluster
permissions:
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["pods"]
    verbs: ["create", "delete", "get", "list", "patch", "deletecollection", "update"]
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["events"]
    verbs: ["create", "get", "list", "patch", "update"]
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["chaosEngines", "chaosExperiments", "chaosResults"]
    verbs: ["create", "delete", "get", "list", "patch", "update"]

    resources: ["nodes"]
    verbs: ["get", "list"]
```

:::tip
If the environment variables `DESTINATION_HOSTS` or `DESTINATION_IPS` are left empty, the default behaviour is to target all hosts. To limit the impact on all the hosts, you can specify the IP addresses of the service (use commas to separate multiple values) or the DNS or the FQDN names of the services in `DESTINATION_HOSTS`.

### Network packet loss

Network packet loss (in percentage) injected into the entire node. This is tuned using the `NETWORK_PACKET_LOSS_PERCENTAGE` environment variable.

The following YAML snippet illustrates the use of these environment variables:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/node-network-loss/network-loss.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# it injects network-loss for the egress traffic
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  appinfo:
    appns: "default"
    applabel: "app=nginx"
    appkind: "deployment"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: node-network-loss
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # network packet loss percentage
        - name: NETWORK_PACKET_LOSS_PERCENTAGE
          value: '100'
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          value: '60'
```

### Destination IPs and destination hosts

Default IPs and hosts affected by the network fault. Use `DESTINATION_IPS` and `DESTINATION_HOSTS` environment variables to specify the IPs and hosts.

- `DESTINATION_IPS`: IP addresses of the services or pods or the CIDR blocks (range of IPs) whose accessibility is impacted.
- `DESTINATION_HOSTS`: DNS names or FQDN names of the services and ports whose accessibility is impacted.

The following YAML snippet illustrates the use of these environment variables:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/node-network-loss/destination-ips-and-hosts.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# it injects the chaos for the egress traffic for specific ips/hosts
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  appinfo:
    appns: "default"
    applabel: "app=nginx"
    appkind: "deployment"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: node-network-loss
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # supports comma separated destination ips
        - name: DESTINATION_IPS
          value: '8.8.8.8,192.168.5.6'
        # supports comma separated destination hosts
        - name: DESTINATION_HOSTS
          value: 'nginx.default.svc.cluster.local'
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
```

### Network interface

Name of the ethernet interface considered to shape the traffic. Its default value is `eth0`. Tune it by using the `NETWORK_INTERFACE` environment variable.

The following YAML snippet illustrates the use of this environment variable:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/node-network-loss/network-interface.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# provide the network interface
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  appinfo:
    appns: "default"
    applabel: "app=nginx"
    appkind: "deployment"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: node-network-loss
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # name of the network interface
        - name: NETWORK_INTERFACE
          value: 'eth0'
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          value: '60'
```

### Container runtime and socket path

The `CONTAINER_RUNTIME` and `SOCKET_PATH` environment variables to set the container runtime and socket file path, respectively.

- `CONTAINER_RUNTIME`: Supports `docker`, `containerd`, and `crio` runtimes. The default value is `containerd`.
- `SOCKET_PATH`: Path of containerd socket file by default(`/run/containerd/containerd.sock`). For `docker`, specify path as `/var/run/docker.sock`. For `crio`, specify path as `/var/run/crio/crio.sock`.

The following YAML snippet illustrates the use of these environment variables:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/node-network-loss/container-runtime-and-socket-path.yaml yaml)
```yaml
## provide the container runtime and socket file path
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  appinfo:
    appns: "default"
    applabel: "app=nginx"
    appkind: "deployment"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: node-network-loss
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # runtime for the container
        # supports docker, containerd, crio
        - name: CONTAINER_RUNTIME
          value: 'containerd'
        # path of the socket file
        - name: SOCKET_PATH
          value: '/run/containerd/containerd.sock'
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          VALUE: '60'
```
