VMware network loss injects network packet loss from the VMware VM(s) into the application (or service).
- This results in flaky access to the application. 
- It checks the performance of the application (or process) running on the VMware VM(s).

## Usage
<details>
<summary>View fault usage</summary>
<div>
This fault simulates issues within the VM network (or microservice) communication across services in different hosts.
It helps determine the impact of degradation while accessing a microservice. 
The VM may stall (or get corrupted) while waiting endlessly for a packet. The fault limits the impact (blast radius) to the traffic that you wish to test by specifying the IP addresses. It simulates degraded network with varied percentages of dropped packets between microservices, loss of access to specific third party (or dependent) services (or components), blackhole against traffic to a given AZ (failure simulation of availability zones), and network partitions (split-brain) between peer replicas for a stateful application.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes > 1.16 
- Vcenter access to stop and start the VM.
- Kubernetes secret that has Vcenter credentials in the `CHAOS_NAMESPACE`. Below is a sample secret file:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: vcenter-secret
  namespace: litmus
type: Opaque
stringData:
    VCENTERSERVER: XXXXXXXXXXX
    VCENTERUSER: XXXXXXXXXXXXX
    VCENTERPASS: XXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

### Note
You can pass the VM credentials as secrets or as a `ChaosEngine` environment variable.

## Default validations
The VM should be in a healthy state before and after chaos.

## Fault examples

### Common fault tunables
Refer to the [common attributes](../common-tunables-for-all-faults) to tune the common tunables for all the faults.

### Network packet loss

It defines the network packet loss (in percentage) that is injected to the VM. You can tune it using the `NETWORK_PACKET_LOSS_PERCENTAGE` environment variable.

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/vmware-network-loss/network-packet-loss-percentage.yaml yaml)
```yaml
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: VMware-engine
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: VMware-network-loss
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # network packet loss percentage
        - name: NETWORK_PACKET_LOSS_PERCENTAGE
          value: '100'
        - name: VM_NAME
          value: 'vm-1,vm-2'
        - name: VM_USER_NAME
          value: 'ubuntu,debian'
        - name: VM_PASSWORD
          value: '123,123'
```

### Run with destination IPs and destination hosts

The network faults interrupt traffic for all the IPs/hosts by default. You can tune this using the `DESTINATION_IPS` and `DESTINATION_HOSTS` environment variables, respectively.

`DESTINATION_IPS`: It contains the IP addresses of the services or the CIDR blocks (range of IPs) that impacts its accessibility.
`DESTINATION_HOSTS`: It contains the DNS names of the services that impact its accessibility.

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/vmware-network-loss/destination-host-and-ip.yaml yaml)
```yaml
## it injects the chaos for the egress traffic for specific ips/hosts
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: VMware-engine
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: VMware-network-loss
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # supports comma separated destination ips
        - name: DESTINATION_IPS
          value: '8.8.8.8,192.168.5.6'
        # supports comma separated destination hosts
        - name: DESTINATION_HOSTS
          value: 'google.com'
        - name: VM_NAME
          value: 'vm-1,vm-2'
        - name: VM_USER_NAME
          value: 'ubuntu,debian'
        - name: VM_PASSWORD
          value: '123,123'
```

###  Network interface

The name of the ethernet interface that shapes the traffic. You can tune it using the `NETWORK_INTERFACE` environment variable. Its default value is `eth0`.

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/vmware-network-loss/network-interface.yaml yaml)
```yaml
## it injects the chaos for the egress traffic for specific ips/hosts
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: VMware-engine
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: VMware-network-loss
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # name of the network interface
        - name: NETWORK_INTERFACE
          value: 'eth0'
        - name: VM_NAME
          value: 'vm-1,vm-2'
        - name: VM_USER_NAME
          value: 'ubuntu,debian'
        - name: VM_PASSWORD
          value: '123,123'
```
