title: VMware HTTP latency
---
VMware HTTP latency injects HTTP response latency into the service whose port is specified using the `TARGET_SERVICE_PORT` environment variable. This is achieved by starting the proxy server and redirecting the traffic through the proxy server.
- It helps determine the application's resilience to lossy (or flaky) HTTP responses.

## Usage

<details>
<summary>View the uses of the fault</summary>
<div>
This fault helps determine how resilient an application is to HTTP latency. It helps determine how the system recovers or fetches the responses when there is a delay in accessing the service. It simulates latency to specific API services for (or from) a given microservice. It also simulates a slow response on specific third party (or dependent) components (or services).

## Prerequisites
- Kubernetes >= 1.17
- Vcenter access to stop and start the VM.
- Kubernetes secret that has the Vcenter credentials in the `CHAOS_NAMESPACE`. Below is a sample secret file:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
    name: vcenter-secret
    namespace: litmus
type: Opaque
stringData:
    VCENTERSERVER: XXXXXXXXXXX
    VCENTERUSER: XXXXXXXXXXXXX
    VCENTERPASS: XXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

### Note
You can pass the VM credentials as secrets or as a `ChaosEngine` environment variable.


## Default validations
The VM should be in a healthy state.

## Fault examples

### Common fault tunables

Refer to the [common attributes](../common-tunables-for-all-faults) to tune the common tunables for all the faults.

### Target service port

It defines the port of the target service. You can tune it using the `TARGET_SERVICE_PORT` environment variable.

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/http-latency/target-service-port.yaml yaml)
```yaml
## provide the port of the targeted service
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: VMware-http-latency
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # provide the port of the targeted service
        - name: TARGET_SERVICE_PORT
          value: "80"
```

### Proxy Port

It defines the port where the proxy server listens for requests. You can tune it using the `PROXY_PORT` environment variable.

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/http-latency/proxy-port.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# provide the port for proxy server
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: VMware-http-latency
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # provide the port for proxy server
        - name: PROXY_PORT
          value: '8080'
        # provide the port of the targeted service
        - name: TARGET_SERVICE_PORT
          value: "80"
```

### Latency

It defines the latency value added to the HTTP request. You can tune it using the `LATENCY` environment variable.

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/http-latency/latency.yaml yaml)
```yaml
## provide the latency value
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: VMware-http-latency
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # provide the latency value
        - name: LATENCY
          value: '2000'
        # provide the port of the targeted service
        - name: TARGET_SERVICE_PORT
          value: "80"
```

### Toxicity

It defines the toxicity value added to the HTTP request. Toxicity value defines the percentage of the total number of HTTP requests that are affected. You can tune it using the `TOXICITY` environment variable.

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/http-latency/toxicity.yaml yaml)
```yaml
## provide the toxicity
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: VMware-http-latency
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # toxicity is the probability of the request to be affected
        # provide the percentage value in the range of 0-100
        # 0 means no request will be affected and 100 means all request will be affected
        - name: TOXICITY
          value: "100"
        # provide the port of the targeted service
        - name: TARGET_SERVICE_PORT
          value: "80"
```

### Network interface

It defines the network interface to be used for the proxy. You can tune it using the `NETWORK_INTERFACE` environment variable.

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/http-latency/network-interface.yaml yaml)
```yaml
## provide the network interface for proxy
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: VMware-http-latency
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # provide the network interface for proxy
        - name: NETWORK_INTERFACE
          value: "eth0"
        # provide the port of the targeted service
        - name: TARGET_SERVICE_PORT
          value: '80'
```
