VMware CPU hog applies stress on the CPU resources on Linux OS based VMware VM.
- It checks the performance of the application running on the VMware VMs.

## Usage

<details>
<summary>View the uses of the fault</summary>
<div>
This fault helps determine how resilient an application is when stress is applied on the CPU resources of a VMware virtual machine.
The fault causes CPU stress on the target resource(s). It simulates the situation of lack of CPU for processes running on the application, which degrades their performance. It also helps verify metrics-based horizontal pod autoscaling as well as vertical autoscale, i.e. demand based CPU addition. It helps scalability of nodes based on growth beyond budgeted pods. It verifies the autopilot functionality of (cloud) managed clusters. 
It benefits include verifying multi-tenant load issues (when the load increases on one container, it does not cause downtime in other containers).

## Prerequisites
- Kubernetes > 1.16
- Execution plane is connected to vCenter and the hosts on port 443. 
- VMware tool is installed on the target VM with remote execution enabled.
- Adequate vCenter permissions to access the hosts and the VMs.
- Create a Kubernetes secret that has the Vcenter credentials in the `CHAOS_NAMESPACE`. Below is a sample secret file:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: vcenter-secret
  namespace: litmus
type: Opaque
stringData:
    VCENTERSERVER: XXXXXXXXXXX
    VCENTERUSER: XXXXXXXXXXXXX
    VCENTERPASS: XXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

### Note
You can pass the VM credentials as secrets or as a `ChaosEngine` environment variable.


## Default validations
The VM should be in a healthy state.

## Fault examples

### Common fault tunables
Refer to the [common attributes](../common-tunables-for-all-faults) to tune the common tunables for all the faults.

### CPU_CORES
It stresses the `CPU_CORE` of the target VM for the duration defined by the `TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION` environment variable.

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/vmware-cpu-hog/vm-cpu-hog-core.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# CPU hog in the VMware VM
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: VMware-cpu-hog
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # Name of the VM
        - name: VM_NAME
          value: 'test-vm-01'
       # CPU cores for stress
        - name: CPU_CORES 
          value: '1'
```
### CPU load
It specifies the load exerted on each VM CPU core (in percentage). You can tune it using the `CPU_LOAD` environment variable.

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/vmware-cpu-hog/vm-cpu-hog-load.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# CPU hog in the VMware VM
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: VMware-cpu-hog
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # Name of the VM
        - name: VM_NAME
          value: 'test-vm-01'
        # CPU load in percentage for the stress
        - name: CPU_LOAD
          value: '100'
```
