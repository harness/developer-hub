title: VMware HTTP reset peer
---

VMware HTTP reset peer injects HTTP reset chaos that stops the outgoing HTTP requests by resetting the TCP connection for the requests.
- The service whose port is affected is specified using the `TARGET_SERVICE_PORT` environment variable. 
- It tests the application's resilience to lossy (or flaky) HTTP connections.

## Usage

<details>
<summary>View the uses of the fault</summary>
<div>
This fault helps determine how resilient an application is when outgoing HTTP requests are halted unexpectly. It determines how quickly and efficiently an application recovers from these unexpected halts. It simulates premature connection loss (firewall issues or other issues) between microservices (verify connection timeout), and connection resets due to resource limitations on the server side like out of memory server (or process killed or overload on the server due to a high amount of traffic).

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes >= 1.17
- Vcenter access to stop and start the VM.
- Kubernetes secret that has the Vcenter credentials in the `CHAOS_NAMESPACE`. Below is a sample secret file:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
    name: vcenter-secret
    namespace: litmus
type: Opaque
stringData:
    VCENTERSERVER: XXXXXXXXXXX
    VCENTERUSER: XXXXXXXXXXXXX
    VCENTERPASS: XXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

### Note
You can pass the VM credentials as secrets or as a `ChaosEngine` environment variable.


## Default validations
The VM should be in a healthy state.

## Fault examples

### Common fault tunables

Refer to the [common attributes](../common-tunables-for-all-faults) to tune the common tunables for all the faults.

### Target service port

It defines the port of the target service. You can tune it using the `TARGET_SERVICE_PORT` environment variable.

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/http-reset-peer/target-service-port.yaml yaml)
```yaml
## provide the port of the targeted service
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: VMware-http-reset-peer
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # provide the port of the targeted service
        - name: TARGET_SERVICE_PORT
          value: "80"
```

### Proxy port

It defines the port where proxy server listens for requests. You can tune it using the `PROXY_PORT` environment variable.

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/http-reset-peer/proxy-port.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# provide the port for proxy server
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: VMware-http-reset-peer
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # provide the port for proxy server
        - name: PROXY_PORT
          value: '8080'
        # provide the port of the targeted service
        - name: TARGET_SERVICE_PORT
          value: "80"
```

### Reset timeout

It defines the reset timeout value that is added to the HTTP request. You can tune it using the `RESET_TIMEOUT` environment variable.

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/http-reset-peer/reset-timeout.yaml yaml)
```yaml
## provide the reset timeout value
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: VMware-http-reset-peer
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # reset timeout specifies after how much duration to reset the connection
        - name: RESET_TIMEOUT #in ms
          value: '2000'
        # provide the port of the targeted service
        - name: TARGET_SERVICE_PORT
          value: "80"
```

### Toxicity

It defines the toxicity value, i.e the percentage of the total number of HTTP requests that are affected. You can tune it using the `TOXICITY` environment variable.

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/http-reset-peer/toxicity.yaml yaml)
```yaml
## provide the toxicity
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: VMware-http-reset-peer
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # toxicity is the probability of the request to be affected
        # provide the percentage value in the range of 0-100
        # 0 means no request will be affected and 100 means all request will be affected
        - name: TOXICITY
          value: "100"
        # provide the port of the targeted service
        - name: TARGET_SERVICE_PORT
          value: "80"
```

### Network interface

It defines the network interface that is used for the proxy. You can tune it using the `NETWORK_INTERFACE` environment variable.

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/http-reset-peer/network-interface.yaml yaml)
```yaml
## provide the network interface for proxy
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: VMware-http-reset-peer
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # provide the network interface for proxy
        - name: NETWORK_INTERFACE
          value: "eth0"
        # provide the port of the targeted service
        - name: TARGET_SERVICE_PORT
          value: '80'
```
