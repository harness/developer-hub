VMware memory hog fault consumes excessive memory resources on Linux OS based VMware VMs.
- It determines the performance of the application running on the VMware VMs.

## Usage

<details>
<summary>View the uses of the fault</summary>
<div>
This fault helps determine how resilient an application is when excessive memory is unexpectedly consumed by resources.
It simulates the situation of memory leaks in the deployment of microservices, application slowness due to memory starvation, and noisy neighbour problems due to hogging. It verifies pod priority and QoS setting for eviction purposes. It also verifies application restarts on OOM kills. 
</div>
</details>


## Prerequisites
- Kubernetes > 1.16
- Execution plane is connected to vCenter and the hosts on port 443. 
- VMware tool is installed on the target VM with remote execution enabled.
- Adequate vCenter permissions to access the hosts and the VMs.
- Create a Kubernetes secret that has the Vcenter credentials in the `CHAOS_NAMESPACE`. Below is a sample secret file:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: vcenter-secret
  namespace: litmus
type: Opaque
stringData:
    VCENTERSERVER: XXXXXXXXXXX
    VCENTERUSER: XXXXXXXXXXXXX
    VCENTERPASS: XXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

### Note
You can pass the VM credentials as secrets or as a `ChaosEngine` environment variable.

## Default validations
The VM should be in a healthy state.

## Fault examples

### Common fault tunables
Refer to the [common attributes](../common-tunables-for-all-faults) to tune the common tunables for all the faults.

### Memory consumption in mebibytes
It defines the memory consumed by the target VM in mebibytes (MiB) for a duration specified by `TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION` environment variable. You can tune it using the `MEMORY_CONSUMPTION_MEBIBYTES` environment variable.

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/vmware-memory-hog/vm-memory-hog-memoryconsumption.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# Memory hog in the VMware VM
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
    - name: VMware-memory-hog
      spec:
        components:
          env:
            # Name of the VM
            - name: VM_NAME
              value: 'test-vm-01'
            # memory consumption value
            - name: MEMORY_CONSUMPTION_MEBIBYTES
              value: '500'
```

### Workers for stress
It specifies the worker's count for stress. You can tune it using the `NUMBER_OF_WORKERS` environment variable.

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/vmware-memory-hog/vm-memory-hog-worker.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# Memory hog in the VMware VM
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
    - name: VMware-memory-hog
      spec:
        components:
          env:
            # Name of the VM
            - name: VM_NAME
              value: 'test-vm-01'
            # Number of workers for stress
            - name: NUMBER_OF_WORKERS
              value: '4'
```
