---

GCP VM instance stop powers off from a GCP VM instance using the instance name (or a list of instance names) before for a specific duration.
- This fault checks the performance of the application (or process) running on the VM instance.
- When the `MANAGED_INSTANCE_GROUP` environment variable is set to `enable`, the fault does not start the instances after chaos. Instead, the fault checks the instance group for new instances.

## Use cases

GCP VM instance stop fault determines the resilience of an application that runs on a VM instance when a VM instance unexpectedly stops (or fails).

### Prerequisites
- Kubernetes > 1.16
- Adequate GCP permissions to stop and start the GCP VM instances.
- The VM instances should be in a healthy state.
- Kubernetes secret should have the GCP service account credentials in the default namespace. Refer [generate the necessary credentials in order to authenticate your identity with the Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](/docs/chaos-engineering/chaos-faults/gcp/security-configurations/prepare-secret-for-gcp.md) docs for more information.

### IAM permissions

Listed below are the IAM permissions leveraged by the fault:
- `compute.instances.get`
- `compute.instances.stop`
- `compute.instances.start`

### Target GCP instances
It stops all the instances with the `VM_INSTANCE_NAMES` instance names in the `ZONES` zone in the `GCP_PROJECT_ID` project.

**GCP project ID**: The project ID which is a unique identifier for a GCP project. Tune it by using the `GCP_PROJECT_ID` environment variable.

**Zones**: The zone of the disk volumes subject to the fault. Tune it by using the `ZONES` environment variable.

**Note:** `VM_INSTANCE_NAMES` environment variable contains multiple comma-separated VM instances. The comma-separated zone names should be provided in the same order as the instance names.

The following YAML snippet illustrates the use of this environment variable:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/gcp-vm-instance-stop/gcp-instance.yaml yaml)
```yaml
## details of the GCP instance
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: gcp-vm-instance-stop
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # comma-separated list of vm instance names
        - name: VM_INSTANCE_NAMES
          value: 'instance-01,instance-02'
        # comma-separated list of zone names corresponds to the VM_INSTANCE_NAMES
        # it should be provided in same order of VM_INSTANCE_NAMES
        - name: ZONES
          value: 'zone-01,zone-02'
        # GCP project ID to which vm instance belongs
        - name: GCP_PROJECT_ID
          value: 'project-id'
```

### Managed instance group

Check if the VM instances belong to a managed instance group. If so, set the `MANAGED_INSTANCE_GROUP` environment variable to `enable` , else `disable`. Its default value is `disable`.

The following YAML snippet illustrates the use of this environment variable:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/gcp-vm-instance-stop/managed-instance-group.yaml yaml)
```yaml
## scale up and down to maintain the available instance counts
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: gcp-vm-instance-stop
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # tells if instances are part of managed instance group
        # supports: enable, disable. default: disable
        - name: MANAGED_INSTANCE_GROUP
          value: 'enable'
        # comma-separated list of vm instance names
        - name: VM_INSTANCE_NAMES
          value: 'instance-01,instance-02'
        # comma-separated list of zone names corresponds to the VM_INSTANCE_NAMES
        # it should be provided in same order of VM_INSTANCE_NAMES
        - name: ZONES
          value: 'zone-01,zone-02'
        # GCP project ID to which vm instance belongs
        - name: GCP_PROJECT_ID
          value: 'project-id'
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          VALUE: '60'
```

### Multiple iterations of chaos

The delay between every chaos iteration. Tune the different iterations using the `CHAOS_INTERVAL` environment variable.

The following YAML snippet illustrates the use of this environment variable:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/gcp-vm-instance-stop/chaos-interval.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# defines delay between each successive iteration of the chaos
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  chaosServiceAccount: gcp-vm-instance-stop-sa
  experiments:
  - name: gcp-vm-instance-stop
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # delay between each iteration of chaos
        - name: CHAOS_INTERVAL
          value: '15'
        # duration for the chaos execution
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          VALUE: '60'
        - name: VM_INSTANCE_NAMES
          value: 'instance-01,instance-02'
        - name: ZONES
          value: 'zone-01,zone-02'
        - name: GCP_PROJECT_ID
          value: 'project-id'
```
