GCP VM instance stop by label powers off from the GCP VM instances (filtered by a label before) for a specific duration.

![GCP VM Instance Stop By Label](./static/images/gcp-vm-instance-stop-by-label.png)

## Use cases

GCP VM instance stop by label fault determines the resilience of an application that runs on a VM instance when a VM instance unexpectedly stops (or fails).

### Prerequisites
- Kubernetes > 1.16
- Adequate GCP permissions to stop and start the GCP VM instances.
- The VM instances with the target label should be in a healthy state.
- Kubernetes secret should have the GCP service account credentials in the default namespace. Refer [generate the necessary credentials in order to authenticate your identity with the Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](/docs/chaos-engineering/chaos-faults/gcp/security-configurations/prepare-secret-for-gcp.md) docs for more information.

### IAM permissions

Listed below are the IAM permissions leveraged by the fault:
- `compute.instances.list`
- `compute.instances.get`
- `compute.instances.stop`
- `compute.instances.start`

### Target GCP instances

It stops all the instances that are filtered using the `INSTANCE_LABEL` label in the `ZONES` zone in the `GCP_PROJECT_ID` project.

**GCP project ID**: The project ID which is a unique identifier for a GCP project. Tune it by using the `GCP_PROJECT_ID` environment variable.

**Zones**: The zone of the disk volumes subject to the fault. Tune it by using the `ZONES` environment variable.

**Note:** `INSTANCE_LABEL` environment variable accepts only one label and `ZONES` accepts only one zone name. Therefore, all the instances must reside in the same zone.

The following YAML snippet illustrates the use of this environment variable:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/gcp-vm-instance-stop-by-label/gcp-instance.yaml yaml)
```yaml
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: gcp-vm-instance-stop-by-label
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        - name: INSTANCE_LABEL
          value: 'vm:target-vm'
        - name: ZONES
          value: 'us-east1-b'
        - name: GCP_PROJECT_ID
          value: 'my-project-4513'
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          VALUE: '60'
```

### Managed instance group

Check if the VM instances belong to a managed instance group. If so, set the `MANAGED_INSTANCE_GROUP` environment variable to `enable` , else `disable`. Its default value is `disable`.

**Instance affected percentage**: The number of VMs filtered using the target label. It defaults to 0 that corresponds to a single instance. Tune it by using the `INSTANCE_AFFECTED_PERC` environment variable.

The following YAML snippet illustrates the use of this environment variable:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/gcp-vm-instance-stop-by-label/managed-instance-group.yaml yaml)
```yaml
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: gcp-vm-instance-stop-by-label
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        - name: MANAGED_INSTANCE_GROUP
          value: 'enable'
        - name: INSTANCE_LABEL
          value: 'vm:target-vm'
        - name: ZONES
          value: 'us-east1-b'
        - name: GCP_PROJECT_ID
          value: 'my-project-4513'
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          VALUE: '60'
        - name: INSTANCE_AFFECTED_PERC
          VALUE: "0"
```
