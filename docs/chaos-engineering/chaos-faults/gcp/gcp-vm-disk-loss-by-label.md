title: GCP VM disk loss by label
---
GCP VM disk loss by label disrupts the state of GCP persistent disk volume filtered using a label by detaching it from its VM instance for a specific duration.

## Usage
<details>
<summary>View fault usage</summary>
<div>
This fault can be used to determine the resilience of the GKE infrastructure. It helps determine how quickly a node can recover when a persistent disk volume is detached from the VM instance associated with it.
</div>
</details>

## Prerequisites
- Kubernetes > 1.16.
- Service account should have editor access (or owner access) to the GCP project.
- Target disk volume should not be a boot disk of any VM instance.
- Kubernetes secret that has the GCP service account credentials in the default namespace. Below is a sample secret file:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: cloud-secret
type: Opaque
stringData:
  type:
  project_id:
  private_key_id:
  private_key:
  client_email:
  client_id:
  auth_uri:
  token_uri:
  auth_provider_x509_cert_url:
  client_x509_cert_url:
```

## Default validations
All the disk volumes that have the target label are attached to their respective instances.

## Fault examples

### Common fault tunables
Refer to the [common attributes](../common-tunables-for-all-faults) to tune the common tunables for all the faults.

### Detach volumes by label

It contains the label of disk volumes that are subject to disk loss. It detaches all the disks with the `DISK_VOLUME_LABEL` label in the `ZONES` zone within the `GCP_PROJECT_ID` project. It re-attaches the disk volume after waiting for the duration specified by `TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION` environment variable.

`NOTE:` The `DISK_VOLUME_LABEL` accepts only one label and `ZONES` accepts only one zone name. Therefore, all the disks must reside in the same zone.

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/gcp-vm-disk-loss-by-label/gcp-disk-loss.yaml yaml)
```yaml
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: gcp-vm-disk-loss-by-label
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        - name: DISK_VOLUME_LABEL
          value: 'disk:target-disk'
        - name: ZONES
          value: 'us-east1-b'
        - name: GCP_PROJECT_ID
          value: 'my-project-4513'
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          VALUE: '60'
```
