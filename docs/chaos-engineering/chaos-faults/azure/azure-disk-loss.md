title: Azure disk loss
---
Azure disk loss detaches the virtual disk from an Azure instance during chaos. 
- After the specific chaos duration, the virtual disk is re-attached to the instance. 
- This fault checks the performance of the application (or process) running on the instance.

## Usage
<details>
<summary>View fault usage</summary>
<div>
This fault determines the resilience of an application to unexpected disk detachment. It determines how quickly the Azure instance recovers from such a failure. 
</div>
</details>

## Prerequisites
- Kubernetes > 1.16
- Adequate Azure access to detach and attach a disk. 
- Use Azure [file-based authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/go/azure-sdk-authorization#use-file-based-authentication) to connect to the instance using Azure GO SDK. To generate auth file, run `az ad sp create-for-rbac --sdk-auth > azure.auth` Azure CLI command.
- Create a Kubernetes secret that contains the auth file created in the previous step in the `CHAOS_NAMESPACE`. Below is a sample secret file:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: cloud-secret
type: Opaque
stringData:
  azure.auth: |-
    {
      "clientId": "XXXXXXXXX",
      "clientSecret": "XXXXXXXXX",
      "subscriptionId": "XXXXXXXXX",
      "tenantId": "XXXXXXXXX",
      "activeDirectoryEndpointUrl": "XXXXXXXXX",
      "resourceManagerEndpointUrl": "XXXXXXXXX",
      "activeDirectoryGraphResourceId": "XXXXXXXXX",
      "sqlManagementEndpointUrl": "XXXXXXXXX",
      "galleryEndpointUrl": "XXXXXXXXX",
      "managementEndpointUrl": "XXXXXXXXX"
    }
```

- If you change the secret key name (from `azure.auth`), ensure that you update the `AZURE_AUTH_LOCATION` environment variable in the chaos experiment with the new name.

## Default validations
Azure disk should be connected to an instance.

## Fault examples

### Common fault tunables

Refer to the [common attributes](../common-tunables-for-all-faults) to tune the common tunables for all the faults.

### Detach virtual disks by name

It contains a comma-separated list of disk names that are subject to disk loss. You can tune it using the `VIRTUAL_DISK_NAMES` environment variable.

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/azure-disk-loss/azure-disks.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# detach multiple Azure disks by their names
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: azure-disk-loss
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # comma separated names of the Azure disks attached to VMs
        - name: VIRTUAL_DISK_NAMES
          value: 'disk-01,disk-02'
        # name of the resource group
        - name: RESOURCE_GROUP
          value: 'rg-azure-disks'
```

### Detach virtual disks attached to scale set instances by name

It contains a comma-separated list of disk names attached to Scale Set instances subject to disk loss. You can tune it using the `VIRTUAL_DISK_NAMES` and `SCALE_SET` environment variables, respectively.

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/azure-disk-loss/azure-scale-set-disk.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# detach multiple Azure disks attached to scale set VMs by their names
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: azure-disk-loss
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # comma separated names of the Azure disks attached to scaleset VMs
        - name: VIRTUAL_DISK_NAMES
          value: 'disk-01,disk-02'
        # name of the resource group
        - name: RESOURCE_GROUP
          value: 'rg-azure-disks'
        # VM belongs to scaleset or not
        - name: SCALE_SET
          value: 'enable'
```
