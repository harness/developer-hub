title: Azure web app stop

Azure web app stop shuts down the application.
- This fault checks if the requests have been re-routed to another instance on the application service.

## Usage
<details>
<summary>View fault usage</summary>
<div>
This fault determines the resilience of a web application to unplanned halts (or stops). It determines the resilience based on how quickly (and efficiently) the application recovers from the failure by re-routing the traffic to a different instance on the same application service. 
</div>
</details>

## Prerequisites
- Kubernetes > 1.16.
- Adequate Azure access to stop and start the web applications. 
- Use Azure [ file-based authentication ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/go/azure-sdk-authorization#use-file-based-authentication) to connect to the instance using Azure GO SDK. To generate the auth file, run `az ad sp create-for-rbac --sdk-auth > azure.auth` Azure CLI command.
- Create a Kubernetes secret that has the auth file created in the previous step in the `CHAOS_NAMESPACE`. Below is a sample secret file:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: cloud-secret
type: Opaque
stringData:
  azure.auth: |-
    {
      "clientId": "XXXXXXXXX",
      "clientSecret": "XXXXXXXXX",
      "subscriptionId": "XXXXXXXXX",
      "tenantId": "XXXXXXXXX",
      "activeDirectoryEndpointUrl": "XXXXXXXXX",
      "resourceManagerEndpointUrl": "XXXXXXXXX",
      "activeDirectoryGraphResourceId": "XXXXXXXXX",
      "sqlManagementEndpointUrl": "XXXXXXXXX",
      "galleryEndpointUrl": "XXXXXXXXX",
      "managementEndpointUrl": "XXXXXXXXX"
    }
```
- If you change the secret key name (from `azure.auth`), ensure that you update the `AZURE_AUTH_LOCATION` environment variable in the chaos experiment with the new name.

## Default validations
Azure target web application should be in the running state.

## Fault examples

### Common fault tunables

Refer to the [common attributes](../common-tunables-for-all-faults) to tune the common tunables for all the experiments.

### Stop web app by name

It contains a comma-separated list of web application names that are subject to chaos. You can tune it using the `AZURE_WEB_APP_NAMES` environment variable.

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/azure-web-app-stop/web-app-stop.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# stop web app for a certain chaos duration 
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: azure-web-app-stop
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # comma-separated names of the Azure web app
        - name: AZURE_WEB_APP_NAMES
          value: 'webApp-01,webApp-02'
        # name of the resource group
        - name: RESOURCE_GROUP
          value: 'chaos-rg'
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          VALUE: '60'
```
