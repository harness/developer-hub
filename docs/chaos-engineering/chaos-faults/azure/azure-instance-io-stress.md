title: Azure instance IO stress
---

Azure instance I/O stress disrupts the state of infra resources. 
- This fault induces stress on the Azure instance using the Azure Run command. This command is executed using the bash scripts that are in-built in the fault.
- It causes I/O stress on the Azure Instance using the bash script for a specific duration.

## Usage

<details>
<summary>View fault usage</summary>
<div>
This fault determines the resilience of an Azure instance when I/O sources are in excess, unexpectedly. It determines how Azure scales the resources to maintain the application when it is under stress. 
It simulates slower disk operations by the application and nosiy neighbour problems by hogging the disk bandwidth. It also verifies the disk performance on increasing I/O threads and varying I/O block sizes. It checks if the application functions under high disk latency conditions, when I/O traffic is very high and includes large I/O blocks, and when other services monopolize the I/O disks.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes >= 1.17
- Azure Run Command agent is installed and running in the target Azure instance.
- Use Azure [file-based authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/go/azure-sdk-authorization#use-file-based-authentication) to connect to the instance using Azure GO SDK. to generate the auth file, run `az ad sp create-for-rbac --sdk-auth > azure.auth` Azure CLI command.
- Create a Kubernetes secret that has the auth file created in the previous step in the `CHAOS_NAMESPACE`. Below is a sample secret file:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: cloud-secret
type: Opaque
stringData:
  azure.auth: |-
    {
      "clientId": "XXXXXXXXX",
      "clientSecret": "XXXXXXXXX",
      "subscriptionId": "XXXXXXXXX",
      "tenantId": "XXXXXXXXX",
      "activeDirectoryEndpointUrl": "XXXXXXXXX",
      "resourceManagerEndpointUrl": "XXXXXXXXX",
      "activeDirectoryGraphResourceId": "XXXXXXXXX",
      "sqlManagementEndpointUrl": "XXXXXXXXX",
      "galleryEndpointUrl": "XXXXXXXXX",
      "managementEndpointUrl": "XXXXXXXXX"
    }
```

- If you change the secret key name (from `azure.auth`), ensure that you update the `AZURE_AUTH_LOCATION` environment variable in the chaos experiment with the new name.

## Default validations

Azure instance should be in a healthy state.

## Fault examples

### Common fault tunables

Refer to the [common attributes](../common-tunables-for-all-faults) to tune the common tunables for all the faults.

### Filesystem utilization in megabytes

It defines the filesytem value that will be utilised on the Azure instance. You can tune it using the `FILESYSTEM_UTILIZATION_BYTES` environment variable.

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/azure-instance-io-stress/filesystem-bytes.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# filesystem bytes to utilize
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: azure-instance-io-stress
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        - name: FILESYSTEM_UTILIZATION_BYTES
          VALUE: '1024'
        # name of the Azure instance
        - name: AZURE_INSTANCE_NAMES
          value: 'instance-1'
        # resource group for the Azure instance
        - name: RESOURCE_GROUP
          value: 'rg-azure'
```

### Filsystem utilization by percentage
It defines the filesytem value that will be utilised on the Azure instance. You can tune it using the `FILESYSTEM_UTILIZATION_PERCENTAGE` environment variable.

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/azure-instance-io-stress/filesystem-percentage.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# filesystem percentage to utilize
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: azure-instance-io-stress
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        - name: FILESYSTEM_UTILIZATION_PERCENTAGE
          VALUE: '50'
        # name of the Azure instance
        - name: AZURE_INSTANCE_NAMES
          value: 'instance-1'
        # resource group for the Azure instance
        - name: RESOURCE_GROUP
          value: 'rg-azure'
```

### Multiple workers

It defines the CPU threads that will be run to spike the filesystem utilisation. As a consequence, it increases the growth of filesystem consumption. You can tune it using the `NUMBER_OF_WORKERS` environment variable.

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/azure-instance-io-stress/multiple-workers.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# multiple workers to utilize resources
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: azure-instance-io-stress
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        - name: NUMBER_OF_WORKERS
          VALUE: '3'
        # name of the Azure instance
        - name: AZURE_INSTANCE_NAMES
          value: 'instance-1'
        # resource group for the Azure instance
        - name: RESOURCE_GROUP
          value: 'rg-azure'
```

### Volume mount path

It defines the location that points to the volume mount path used in I/O stress, with respect to the Azure instance. You can tune it using the `VOLUME_MOUNT_PATH` environment variable.

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/azure-instance-io-stress/volume-path.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# volume path to be used for io stress
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: azure-instance-io-stress
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        - name: VOLUME_MOUNT_PATH
          VALUE: '/tmp'
        # name of the Azure instance
        - name: AZURE_INSTANCE_NAMES
          value: 'instance-1'
        # resource group for the Azure instance
        - name: RESOURCE_GROUP
          value: 'rg-azure'
```

### Multiple Azure instances

Multiple Azure instances can be targeted in a single chaos run. You can tune it using the `AZURE_INSTANCE_NAMES` environment variable.

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/azure-instance-io-stress/multiple-instances.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# mutilple instance targets
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: azure-instance-io-stress
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        - name: MEMORY_CONSUMPTION
          VALUE: '1024'
        # names of the Azure instance
        - name: AZURE_INSTANCE_NAMES
          value: 'instance-1,instance-2'
        # resource group for the Azure instance
        - name: RESOURCE_GROUP
          value: 'rg-azure'
```
