description: An overview of onboarding with HCE
---

This topic describes the typical steps to execute a chaos experiment, and delves into how you can deploy the HCE application in two different modes, that is, [automated onboarding](/docs/chaos-engineering/onboarding/single-click-onboarding) and [guided onboarding](/docs/chaos-engineering/onboarding/guided-onboarding).

## Before you begin

* [What is chaos engineering?](/docs/chaos-engineering/get-started/overview)
* [Key concepts](/docs/chaos-engineering/architecture-and-security/architecture/components)

## Steps to create and execute a HCE experiment

You can execute a chaos experiment by:

1. [Fulfilling the resource requirements](/docs/chaos-engineering/get-started/tutorials/prerequisites.md): In this step, you can create resources or get the required permissions to create the necessary resources.
2. [Adding an environment](/docs/chaos-engineering/features/chaos-infrastructure/connect-chaos-infrastructures#step-1-create-an-environment): A chaos experiment is performed within a chaos environment that houses the necessary infrastructure.
3. [Adding a chaos infrastructure](/docs/chaos-engineering/features/chaos-infrastructure/connect-chaos-infrastructures#step-2-add-a-chaos-infrastructure): The required chaos infrastructure is created within a chaos environment.
4. [Validating the chaos infrastructure installation](/docs/chaos-engineering/features/chaos-infrastructure/connect-chaos-infrastructures#step-3-validate-the-chaos-infrastructure-installation): Once you create your chaos infrastructure, ensure that it has been created in the right manner.
5. [Creating a demo application](/docs/chaos-engineering/get-started/tutorials/first-chaos-engineering#creating-a-demo-application-and-observability-infrastructure): You can either create a demo application or use your application on which you can execute chaos experiments.
6. [Creating and running a chaos experiment](/docs/chaos-engineering/features/experiments/construct-and-run-custom-chaos-experiments.md): Once you have set up your application, you can decide which resources to target and execute the chaos experiments on.

The steps mentioned earlier required some reading and exploring, but if you want a head start to your chaos journey, enter [automated onboarding](/docs/chaos-engineering/onboarding/single-click-onboarding) and [guided onboarding](/docs/chaos-engineering/onboarding/guided-onboarding).

### Automated and guided onboarding

You can execute chaos experiments without explicitly installing the environment or infrastructure or creating an experiment by specifying tunables.

1. To get hands-on experience, navigate to the **Chaos** module and select **Overview**. Select **Select a cluster**, where you can choose between automatic and guided onboarding.

2. If you choose **Yes, in a single step!**, go to [automated onboarding](/docs/chaos-engineering/onboarding/single-click-onboarding.md), and if you choose **No, I will choose**, go to [guided onboarding](/docs/chaos-engineering/onboarding/guided-onboarding.md).
