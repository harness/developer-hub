This section discusses the steps required to run chaos experiments on specific namespaces.

### Step 1. Install CE in cluster mode

- Install CE in cluster mode with the given installation manifest. 
- Restrict `litmus-admin` service account to certain target namespaces.

### Step 2. Delete `litmus-admin` ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding
- Once CE is up and running in cluster mode, delete the `litmus-admin` ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding to restrict the chaos scope in all namespaces.

```bash
$> kubectl delete clusterrole litmus-admin
````

```
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io "litmus-admin" deleted
```

```bash
$> kubectl delete clusterrolebinding litmus-admin
````

```
clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io "litmus-admin" deleted
```

### Step 3. Create Role and RoleBinding in all target namespaces

This allows specific namespaces for chaos operations. Create Role and RoleBinding in these specific namespaces (say `namespaceA` and `namespaceB`). 

The manifest for `role-1.yaml` in `namespaceA` will look as shown below.

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: namespaceA-chaos
  namespace: litmus
  labels:
    name: namespaceA-chaos
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: litmus
rules:
  # Create and monitor the experiment & helper pods
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["pods"]
    verbs: ["create","delete","get","list","patch","update", "deletecollection"]
  # Performs CRUD operations on the events inside chaosengine and chaosresult
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["events"]
    verbs: ["create","get","list","patch","update"]
  # Fetch configmaps details and mount it to the experiment pod (if specified)
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["configmaps"]
    verbs: ["get","list",]
  # Track and get the runner, experiment, and helper pods log 
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["pods/log"]
    verbs: ["get","list","watch"]  
  # for creating and managing to execute comands inside target container
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["pods/exec"]
    verbs: ["get","list","create"]
  # deriving the parent/owner details of the pod(if parent is anyof {deployment, statefulset, daemonsets})
  - apiGroups: ["apps"]
    resources: ["deployments","statefulsets","replicasets", "daemonsets"]
    verbs: ["list","get"]
  # deriving the parent/owner details of the pod(if parent is deploymentConfig)  
  - apiGroups: ["apps.openshift.io"]
    resources: ["deploymentconfigs"]
    verbs: ["list","get"]
  # deriving the parent/owner details of the pod(if parent is deploymentConfig)
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["replicationcontrollers"]
    verbs: ["get","list"]
  # deriving the parent/owner details of the pod(if parent is argo-rollouts)
  - apiGroups: ["argoproj.io"]
    resources: ["rollouts"]
    verbs: ["list","get"]
  # for configuring and monitor the experiment job by the chaos-runner pod
  - apiGroups: ["batch"]
    resources: ["jobs"]
    verbs: ["create","list","get","delete","deletecollection"]
  # for creation, status polling and deletion of litmus chaos resources used within a chaos workflow
  - apiGroups: ["litmuschaos.io"]
    resources: ["chaosengines","chaosexperiments","chaosresults"]
    verbs: ["create","list","get","patch","update","delete"]
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: namespaceA-chaos
  namespace: litmus
  labels:
    name: namespaceA-chaos
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: litmus
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: Role
  name: namespaceA-chaos
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: litmus-admin
  namespace: litmus
```

The manifest for `role-2.yaml` in `namespaceB` will look as shown below.

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: namespaceB-chaos
  namespace: namespaceB
  labels:
    name: namespaceB-chaos
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: litmus
rules:
  # Create and monitor the experiment & helper pods
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["pods"]
    verbs: ["create","delete","get","list","patch","update", "deletecollection"]
  # Performs CRUD operations on the events inside chaosengine and chaosresult
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["events"]
    verbs: ["create","get","list","patch","update"]
  # Fetch configmaps details and mount it to the experiment pod (if specified)
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["configmaps"]
    verbs: ["get","list",]
  # Track and get the runner, experiment, and helper pods log 
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["pods/log"]
    verbs: ["get","list","watch"]  
  # for creating and managing to execute comands inside target container
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["pods/exec"]
    verbs: ["get","list","create"]
  # deriving the parent/owner details of the pod(if parent is anyof {deployment, statefulset, daemonsets})
  - apiGroups: ["apps"]
    resources: ["deployments","statefulsets","replicasets", "daemonsets"]
    verbs: ["list","get"]
  # deriving the parent/owner details of the pod(if parent is deploymentConfig)  
  - apiGroups: ["apps.openshift.io"]
    resources: ["deploymentconfigs"]
    verbs: ["list","get"]
  # deriving the parent/owner details of the pod(if parent is deploymentConfig)
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["replicationcontrollers"]
    verbs: ["get","list"]
  # deriving the parent/owner details of the pod(if parent is argo-rollouts)
  - apiGroups: ["argoproj.io"]
    resources: ["rollouts"]
    verbs: ["list","get"]
  # for configuring and monitor the experiment job by the chaos-runner pod
  - apiGroups: ["batch"]
    resources: ["jobs"]
    verbs: ["create","list","get","delete","deletecollection"]
  # for creation, status polling and deletion of litmus chaos resources used within a chaos workflow
  - apiGroups: ["litmuschaos.io"]
    resources: ["chaosengines","chaosexperiments","chaosresults"]
    verbs: ["create","list","get","patch","update","delete"]
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: namespaceB-chaos
  namespace: namespaceB
  labels:
    name: namespaceB-chaos
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: litmus
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: Role
  name: namespaceB-chaos
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: litmus-admin
  namespace: litmus
```

:::info
The rolebinding subjects point to the `litmus-admin` service account only (in CE namespace). 
:::

#### Create the roles

```bash
$> kubectl apply -f role-1.yaml
````

```role.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/namespaceA-chaos created```
```rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/namespaceA-chaos created```

```bash
$> kubectl apply -f role-2.yaml
```

```role.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/namespaceB-chaos created```
```rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/namespaceB-chaos created```

### Step 4. Create Role and RoleBinding in all target namespaces

Create a Role and RoleBinding in the chaos namespace as well. This will be used by chaos runner pod to launch experiment. 

### Step 5. Verify the chaos execution on different namespaces

Run an experiment, say pod-delete in both the namespaces to verify if these namespaces have the permission to run experiments.

For namespaceA:

![namespace A](./static/namespace-considerations/nsA.png)

For namespaceA:

![namespace B](./static/namespace-considerations/nsB.png)

You are able to run chaos on the target namespaces (`namespaceA` and `namespaceB`). Now, you can check to see if namespace `test` can be used to run chaos experiments.

For `test` namespace:

The experiment fails to run and experiment pod logs.

```
time="2022-11-14T06:47:47Z" level=info msg="Experiment Name: pod-delete"
time="2022-11-14T06:47:47Z" level=info msg="[PreReq]: Getting the ENV for the pod-delete experiment"
time="2022-11-14T06:47:49Z" level=info msg="[PreReq]: Updating the chaos result of pod-delete experiment (SOT)"
time="2022-11-14T06:47:51Z" level=info msg="The application information is as follows" Namespace=test Label="app=nginx" Chaos Duration=30
time="2022-11-14T06:47:51Z" level=info msg="[Status]: Verify that the AUT (Application Under Test) is running (pre-chaos)"
time="2022-11-14T06:47:51Z" level=info msg="[Status]: Checking whether application containers are in ready state"
time="2022-11-14T06:50:53Z" level=error msg="Application status check failed, err: Unable to find the pods with matching labels, err: pods is forbidden: User \"system:serviceaccount:litmus:litmus-admin\" cannot list resource \"pods\" in API group \"\" in the namespace \"test\""
```

You have successfully restricted CE to run chaos on certain namespaces instead of all namespaces.
