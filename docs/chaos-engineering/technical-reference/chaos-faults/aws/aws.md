## Introduction

AWS faults disrupt the resources running on different AWS services from the EKS cluster. To perform such AWS chaos experiments, you will need to authenticate HCE with the AWS platform. This can be done in two ways.  

- **Using secrets:** You can use secrets to authenticate HCE with AWS regardless of whether the Kubernetes cluster is used for the deployment. This is Kubernetesâ€™ native way of authenticating HCE with AWS.
- [**IAM integration:**](./aws-iam-integration) You can authenticate HCE using AWS using IAM when you have deployed chaos on the EKS cluster. You can associate an IAM role with a Kubernetes service account. This service account can be used to provide AWS permissions to the experiment pod which uses the particular service account.

Here are AWS faults that you can execute and validate.
