## Introduction

AWS faults disrupt the resources running on different AWS services from the EKS cluster. To perform such AWS chaos experiments, you will need to authenticate CE with the AWS platform. This can be done in two ways.

- **Using secrets:** You can use secrets to authenticate CE with AWS regardless of whether the Kubernetes cluster is used for the deployment. This is Kubernetesâ€™ native way of authenticating CE with AWS.
- [**IAM integration:**](./aws-iam-integration) You can authenticate CE using AWS using IAM when you have deployed chaos on the EKS cluster. You can associate an IAM role with a Kubernetes service account. This service account can be used to provide AWS permissions to the experiment pod which uses the particular service account.

Here are AWS faults that you can execute and validate.

- Verifies the behavior of ECS tasks and their containers when the start or stop timeout is exceeded during updates or deployments.
- Tests the recovery mechanisms of the ECS service and container instances in case of timeouts.
- Simulates scenarios where containers take longer than expected to start or stop.
- Evaluates the impact of above-mentioned scenarios on the overall application availability and performance.

### Lambda delete event source mapping

Lambda delete event source mapping removes the event source mapping from an AWS Lambda function for a specific duration.

- It checks the performance of the application (or service) without the event source mapping which may cause missing entries in a database.

<Accordion color="green">
<summary>Use cases</summary>
Deleting an event source mapping from a Lambda function is critical. It can lead to scenarios such as failure to update the database on an event trigger, which can break the service. 
Such faults determine if proper error handling or auto recovery options have been configured for the application.
</Accordion>
</FaultDetailsCard>

<FaultDetailsCard category="aws">

### Lambda toggle event mapping state

Lambda toggle event mapping state toggles (or sets) the event source mapping state to `disable` for a Lambda function during a specific duration.

- It checks the performance of the running application (or service) when the event source mapping is not enabled which may cause missing entries in a database.

<Accordion color="green">
<summary>Use cases</summary>
Toggling between different states of event source mapping from a Lambda function may lead to failures in updating the database on an event trigger. This can break the service and impact its delivery. It helps determine if the application has proper error handling or auto recovery actions configured.

### Lambda update function memory

Lambda update function memory causes the memory of a Lambda function to be updated to a specified value for a certain duration.

- It checks the performance of the application (or service) running with a new memory limit.
- It helps determine a safe overall memory limit value for the function.
- Smaller the memory limit higher will be the time taken by the Lambda function under load.

<Accordion color="green">
<summary>Use cases</summary>
Hitting a memory limit with Lambda functions may slow down the service and impact their delivery. Running out of memory due to smaller limits may interrupt the flow of the given function. These fault helps build resilience to such unexpected scenarios.

### Lambda update function timeout

Lambda update function timeout causes timeout of a Lambda function to be updated to a specified value for a certain duration.

### Lambda update role permission

Lambda update role permission is an AWS fault that modifies the role policies associated with a Lambda function.

- It verifies the handling mechanism for function failures.
- It can also be used to update the role attached to a Lambda function.
- It checks the performance of the running lambda application in case it does not have enough permissions.

<Accordion color="green">
<summary>Use cases</summary>
Lambda functions sometimes depend on services such as RDS, DynamoDB, S3, etc. In such cases, certain permissions are required to access these services. This chaos fault helps understand how your application would behave when a Lambda function does not have enough permissions to access the services.

### Lambda delete function concurrency

Lambda delete function concurrency is an AWS fault that deletes the Lambda function's reserved concurrency, thereby ensuring that the function has adequate unreserved concurrency to run.

- Examines the performance of the running Lambda application, if the Lambda function lacks sufficient concurrency.

<Accordion color="green">
<summary>Use cases</summary>
When there is no unreserved concurrency left to run the Lambda function, this chaos fault can be used to check how your application behaves.

Windows EC2 blackhole chaos:
- Degrades the network without the EC2 instance being marked as unhealthy (or unworthy) of traffic. This can be resolved by using a middleware that switches the traffic based on certain SLOs (performance parameters). 
- Limits the impact, that is, blast radius to only the traffic that you wish to test, by specifying the destination hosts or IP addresses.
