title: EC2 stop by tag
---

EC2 stop by tag stops an EC2 instance using the provided tag.
- It brings back the instance after a specific duration. 
- It checks the performance of the application (or process) running on the EC2 instance.
- When the `MANAGED_NODEGROUP` environment variable is enabled, the fault will not try to start the instance after chaos. Instead, it checks for the addition of a new node instance to the cluster.

## Usage

<details>
<summary>View fault usage</summary>
<div>
This fault determines the resilience of an application to unexpected halts in the EC2 instance by validating its failover capabilities.
</div>
</details>

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes > 1.16.
- Ensure that you have sufficient AWS access to stop and start an EC2 instance. 
- Ensure to create a Kubernetes secret having the AWS access configuration(key) in the `CHAOS_NAMESPACE`. Below is the sample secret file.
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: cloud-secret
type: Opaque
stringData:
  cloud_config.yml: |-
    # Add the cloud AWS credentials respectively
    [default]
    aws_access_key_id = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    aws_secret_access_key = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```
- It is recommended to use the same secret name, i.e. `cloud-secret`. Otherwise, you will need to update the `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` environment variable in the fault template and you may be unable to use the default health check probes. 

- Refer to [AWS Named Profile For Chaos](./security-configurations/aws-switch-profile.md) to know how to use a different profile for AWS faults.

### Warning

If the target EC2 instance is a part of a self-managed nodegroup, ensure that you drain the target node if any application is running on it. Cordon the target node before running the fault so that the fault pods do not schedule on it.

## Permissions required

Here is an example AWS policy to execute the fault.

<details>
<summary>View policy for the fault</summary>

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:StartInstances",
                "ec2:StopInstances",
                "ec2:DescribeInstanceStatus",
                "ec2:DescribeInstances"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "autoscaling:DescribeAutoScalingInstances"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```
</details>

Refer to the [superset permission/policy](./security-configurations/policy-for-all-aws-faults.md) to execute all AWS faults.

## Default validations

The EC2 instances should be in a healthy state.

## Fault examples

### Common and AWS-specific tunables

Refer to the [common attributes](../common-tunables-for-all-faults) and [AWS-specific tunables](./aws-fault-tunables) to tune the common tunables for all faults and aws specific tunables.

### Target single instance

It will stop a random single EC2 instance with the given `INSTANCE_TAG` tag and the `REGION` region.

You can tune it using the following example.

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/ec2-stop-by-tag/instance-tag.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# target the EC2 instances with matching tag
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: ec2-terminate-by-tag
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # tag of the EC2 instance
        - name: INSTANCE_TAG
          value: 'key:value'
        # region for the EC2 instance
        - name: REGION
          value: 'us-east-1'
```

### Target Percent of instances

It will stop the `INSTANCE_AFFECTED_PERC` percentage of EC2 instances with the given `INSTANCE_TAG` tag and `REGION` region.

You can tune it using the following example.

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/ec2-stop-by-tag/instance-affected-percentage.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# percentage of EC2 instances, needs to terminate with provided tags
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: ec2-terminate-by-tag
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # percentage of EC2 instance filtered by tags
        - name: INSTANCE_AFFECTED_PERC
          value: '100'
        # tag of the EC2 instance
        - name: INSTANCE_TAG
          value: 'key:value'
        # region for the EC2 instance
        - name: REGION
          value: 'us-east-1'
```
