title: ECS container HTTP status code
---
ECS container HTTP status code injects HTTP chaos that affects the request (or response) by modifying the status code (or the body or the headers) by starting a proxy server and redirecting the traffic through the proxy server on the target ECS containers.

![ECS Container HTTP Modify Response](./static/images/ecs-container-http-status-code.png)

:::tip
This experiment induces chaos within a container and depends on an EC2 instance. Typically, these are prefixed with ["ECS container"](./ec2-and-serverless-faults#ec2-backed-faults) and involve direct interaction with the EC2 instances hosting the ECS containers.
:::

## Use cases
ECS container HTTP status code:
- Tests the ECS task container resilience to erroneous code HTTP responses from the application server.
- Simulates unavailability of specific API services (503, 404), unavailability of specific APIs for(or from) a given microservice (TBD or Path Filter) (404).
- Simulates unauthorized requests for 3rd party services (401 or 403), and API malfunction (internal server error) (50x) on ECS task container.


## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes >= 1.17
- ECS container metadata is enabled (disabled by default). To enable it, refer to this [docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/container-metadata.html). If your task is running from before, you may need to restart it to get the metadata directory.
- ECS cluster running with the desired tasks and containers and familiarity with ECS service update and deployment concepts.
- Access to the ECS cluster instances with the necessary permissions to update the start and stop timeouts for containers. Refer to [systems manager docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/setup-launch-managed-instance.html).
- Backup and recovery mechanisms to handle potential failures during the testing process.
- You and the ECS cluster instances have a role with the required AWS access to perform the SSM and ECS operations.
- Kubernetes secret with AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key credentials in the `CHAOS_NAMESPACE`. Below is the sample secret file:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: cloud-secret
type: Opaque
stringData:
  cloud_config.yml: |-
    # Add the cloud AWS credentials respectively
    [default]
    aws_access_key_id = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    aws_secret_access_key = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

- It is recommended to use the same secret name, that is, `cloud-secret`. Otherwise, you will need to update the `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` environment variable in the fault template and you may be unable to use the default health check probes. 

:::info note
- You can pass the VM credentials as secrets or as a `ChaosEngine` environment variable.
- The ECS container should be in a healthy state before and after introducing chaos.
- Refer to the [superset permission or policy](./security-configurations/policy-for-all-aws-faults.md) to execute all AWS faults.
- Refer to the [common attributes](../common-tunables-for-all-faults) to tune the common tunables for all the faults.
- Refer to [AWS named profile for chaos](./security-configurations/aws-switch-profile.md) to use a different profile for AWS faults.

### Target service port

Service port that is targeted. Tune it by using the `TARGET_SERVICE_PORT` environment variable.

The following YAML snippet illustrates the use of this environment variable:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/ecs-container-http-status-code/target-service-port.yaml yaml)
```yaml
## provide the port of the targeted service
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: ecs-container-http-status-code
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # provide the port of the targeted service
        - name: TARGET_SERVICE_PORT
          value: "80"
```

### Modifying the response status code

Response body that is modified. Tune it by using the `RESPONSE_BODY` environment variable.

:::info note
`HTTP_CHAOS_TYPE` should be provided as `status_code`.

### Network interface

Network interface used for the proxy. Tune it by using the `NETWORK_INTERFACE` environment variable.
