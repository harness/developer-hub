## Introduction

Lambda delete event source mapping removes the event source mapping from an AWS Lambda function for a specific duration. Deleting an event source mapping from a Lambda function is critical. It can lead to failure in updating the database on an event trigger, which can break the service.

## Use cases
Lambda delete event source mapping:
- Determines the performance of the application (or service) without the event source mapping that may cause missing entries in a database.
- Determines whether proper error handling or auto-recovery options have been configured for the application.


## Prerequisites
- Kubernetes >= 1.17
- AWS Lambda event source mapping must be healthy and attached to the Lambda function.
- Kubernetes secret should have the AWS access configuration(key) in the `CHAOS_NAMESPACE`. A secret file looks like this:
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Secret
  metadata:
    name: cloud-secret
  type: Opaque
  stringData:
    cloud_config.yml: |-
      # Add the cloud AWS credentials respectively
      [default]
      aws_access_key_id = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
      aws_secret_access_key = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
  ```

:::tip
HCE recommends that you use the same secret name, that is, `cloud-secret`. Otherwise, you will need to update the `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` environment variable in the fault template with the new secret name and you won't be able to use the default health check probes.

Below is an example AWS policy to execute the fault.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "lambda:ListEventSourceMappings",
                "lambda:DeleteEventSourceMapping",
                "lambda:UpdateEventSourceMapping",
                "lambda:CreateEventSourceMapping",
                "lambda:UpdateFunctionConfiguration",
                "lambda:GetFunctionConcurrency",
                "lambda:GetFunction",
                "lambda:DeleteFunctionConcurrency",
                "lambda:PutFunctionConcurrency"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

:::info note
- Refer to [AWS named profile for chaos](./security-configurations/aws-switch-profile.md) to use a different profile for AWS faults.
- Refer to the [superset permission/policy](./security-configurations/policy-for-all-aws-faults.md) to execute all AWS faults.
- Refer to the [common tunables](../common-tunables-for-all-faults) and [AWS-specific tunables](./aws-fault-tunables) to tune the common tunables for all faults and AWS-specific tunables.

### Multiple event source mapping

Deletes multiple event source mappings for a specific duration using `EVENT_UUIDS` environment variable. This variable takes the UUID of the events as a comma-separated value.

The following YAML snippet illustrates the use of this environment variable:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/lambda-delete-event-source-mapping/multiple-events.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# contains the removal of multiple event source mapping
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: lambda-delete-event-source-mapping
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # provide UUIDS of event source mapping
        - name: EVENT_UUIDS
          value: 'id1,id2'
        # provide the function name for the chaos
        - name: FUNCTION_NAME
          value: 'chaos-function'
```
