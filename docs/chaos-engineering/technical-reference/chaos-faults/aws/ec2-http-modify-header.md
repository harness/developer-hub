title: EC2 HTTP modify header
---

EC2 HTTP modify header injects HTTP chaos which affects the request (or response) by modifying the status code (or the body or the headers) by starting the proxy server and redirecting the traffic through the proxy server.
- It modifies the headers of requests and responses of the service. 
- This can be used to test the resilience of the application to incorrect (or incomplete) headers.

## Usage

This can be used to test service resilience towards incorrect or incomplete headers.
</div>
</details>


## Prerequisites
- Kubernetes >= 1.17
- SSM agent is installed and running in the target EC2 instance.
- Kubernetes secret with AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key credentials in the `CHAOS_NAMESPACE`. A secret file looks like:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: cloud-secret
type: Opaque
stringData:
  cloud_config.yml: |-
    # Add the cloud AWS credentials respectively
    [default]
    aws_access_key_id = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    aws_secret_access_key = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

- It is recommended to use the same secret name, i.e. `cloud-secret`. Otherwise, you will need to update the `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` environment variable in the fault template and you may be unable to use the default health check probes. 

- Refer to [AWS Named Profile For Chaos](./security-configurations/aws-switch-profile.md) to know how to use a different profile for AWS faults.

### Note

You can pass the VM credentials as secrets or as a `ChaosEngine` environment variable.

## Permissions required

Here is an example AWS policy to execute the fault.

## Fault examples

### Fault tunables

Refer to the [common attributes](../common-tunables-for-all-faults) to tune the common tunables for all the faults.

### Target service port

It is the targeted service's port being targeted. You can tune it using the `TARGET_SERVICE_PORT` environment variable.

You can tune it using the following example:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/http-modify-header/target-service-port.yaml yaml)
```yaml
## provide the port of the targeted service
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: ec2-http-modify-header
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # provide the port of the targeted service
        - name: TARGET_SERVICE_PORT
          value: "80"
```

### Modifying the response headers

You can modify the response body using the following example:

***Note***: `HTTP_CHAOS_TYPE` should be provided as `header`

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/http-modify-header/response-headers.yaml yaml)
```yaml
## provide the headers as a map
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: ec2-http-modify-header
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # map of headers to modify/add; For example, {"X-Litmus-Test-Header": "X-Litmus-Test-Value"}
        # to remove a header, just set the value to ""; For example, {"X-Litmus-Test-Header": ""}
        - name: HEADERS_MAP
          value: '{"X-Litmus-Test-Header": "X-Litmus-Test-Value"}'
        # whether to modify response headers or request headers. Accepted values: request, response
        - name: HEADER_MODE
          value: 'response'
        # provide the port of the targeted service
        - name: TARGET_SERVICE_PORT
          value: "80"
```

### Modifying the request headers

You can modify the response body using the following example:

***Note***: `HTTP_CHAOS_TYPE` should be provided as `header`

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/http-modify-header/response-headers.yaml yaml)
```yaml
## provide the headers as a map
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: ec2-http-modify-header
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # map of headers to modify/add; For example, {"X-Litmus-Test-Header": "X-Litmus-Test-Value"}
        # to remove a header, just set the value to ""; For example, {"X-Litmus-Test-Header": ""}
        - name: HEADERS_MAP
          value: '{"X-Litmus-Test-Header": "X-Litmus-Test-Value"}'
        # whether to modify response headers or request headers. Accepted values: request, response
        - name: HEADER_MODE
          value: 'response'
        # provide the port of the targeted service
        - name: TARGET_SERVICE_PORT
          value: "80"
```

### Proxy port

It is the port where the proxy server listens for requests. You can tune it using the `PROXY_PORT` environment variable.

You can tune it using the following example:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/http-modify-header/proxy-port.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# provide the port for proxy server
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: ec2-http-modify-header
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # provide the port for proxy server
        - name: PROXY_PORT
          value: '8080'
        # provide the port of the targeted service
        - name: TARGET_SERVICE_PORT
          value: "80"
```

### Toxicity

It defines the toxicity value to be added to the http request. You can tune it using the `TOXICITY` environment variable.
Toxicity value defines the percentage of the total number of http requests that are affected.

You can tune it using the following example:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/http-modify-header/toxicity.yaml yaml)
```yaml
## provide the toxicity
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: ec2-http-modify-header
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # toxicity is the probability of the request that is affected
        # provide the percentage value in the range of 0-100
        # 0 means no request will be affected and 100 means all requests will be affected
        - name: TOXICITY
          value: "100"
        # provide the port of the targeted service
        - name: TARGET_SERVICE_PORT
          value: "80"
```

### Network interface

It defines the network interface used for the proxy. You can tune it using the `NETWORK_INTERFACE` environment variable.

You can tune it using the following example:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/http-modify-header/network-interface.yaml yaml)
```yaml
## provide the network interface for proxy
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: ec2-http-modify-header
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # provide the network interface for proxy
        - name: NETWORK_INTERFACE
          value: "eth0"
        # provide the port of the targeted service
        - name: TARGET_SERVICE_PORT
          value: '80'
```
