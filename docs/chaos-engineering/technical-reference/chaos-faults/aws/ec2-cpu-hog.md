title: EC2 CPU hog
---

EC2 CPU hog induces stress on the AWS EC2 instances using the Amazon SSM Run command. The SSM Run command is executed using SSM documentation that is built into the fault. This fault:
- Causes CPU chaos on the target EC2 instances using the `EC2_INSTANCE_ID` environment variable for a specific duration.

## Use cases

EC2 CPU hog:
- Induces CPU stress on the target AWS EC2 instance(s). 
- Simulates a lack of CPU for processes running on the application, which degrades their performance. 
- Simulates slow application traffic or exhaustion of the resources, leading to degradation in the performance of processes on the instance.

:::note
- Kubernetes >= 1.17 is required to execute this fault.
- The EC2 instance should be in a healthy state.
- SSM agent should be installed and running on the target EC2 instance.
- SSM IAM role should be attached to the target EC2 instance(s).
- Kubernetes secret should have the AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key credentials in the `CHAOS_NAMESPACE`. Below is a sample secret file:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: cloud-secret
type: Opaque
stringData:
  cloud_config.yml: |-
    # Add the cloud AWS credentials respectively
    [default]
    aws_access_key_id = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    aws_secret_access_key = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

- It is recommended to use the same secret name, that is, `cloud-secret`. Otherwise, you will need to update the `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` environment variable in the fault template and you won't be able to use the default health check probes.

Here is an example AWS policy to execute the fault.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ssm:GetDocument",
                "ssm:DescribeDocument",
                "ssm:GetParameter",
                "ssm:GetParameters",
                "ssm:SendCommand",
                "ssm:CancelCommand",
                "ssm:CreateDocument",
                "ssm:DeleteDocument",
                "ssm:GetCommandInvocation",          
                "ssm:UpdateInstanceInformation",
                "ssm:DescribeInstanceInformation"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2messages:AcknowledgeMessage",
                "ec2messages:DeleteMessage",
                "ec2messages:FailMessage",
                "ec2messages:GetEndpoint",
                "ec2messages:GetMessages",
                "ec2messages:SendReply"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:DescribeInstanceStatus",
                "ec2:DescribeInstances"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

### CPU core

It specifies the CPU core value that will be utilized on the EC2 instance. Tune it by using the `CPU_CORE` environment variable.

Use the following example to tune CPU core:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/ec2-cpu-hog/cpu-core.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# CPU cores to utilize
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: ec2-cpu-hog
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        - name: CPU_CORE
          value: '2'
        # ID of the EC2 instance
        - name: EC2_INSTANCE_ID
          value: 'instance-1'
        # region for the EC2 instance
        - name: REGION
          value: 'us-east-1'
```

### CPU percentage

It specifies the CPU percentage value that will be utilized on the EC2 instance. Tune it by using the `CPU_LOAD` environment variable.

Use the following example to tune CPU percentage:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/ec2-cpu-hog/cpu-percentage.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# CPU percentage to utilize
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: ec2-cpu-hog
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        - name: CPU_LOAD
          value: '50'
        # ID of the EC2 instance
        - name: EC2_INSTANCE_ID
          value: 'instance-1'
        # region for the EC2 instance
        - name: REGION
          value: 'us-east-1'
```

### Multiple EC2 instances

It specifies multiple EC2 instances that are targeted in one chaos run. Tune it by using the `EC2_INSTANCE_ID` environment variable.

Use the following example to tune multiple EC2 instances:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/ec2-cpu-hog/multiple-instances.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# mutilple instance targets
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: ec2-cpu-hog
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # ids of the EC2 instances
        - name: EC2_INSTANCE_ID
          value: 'instance-1,instance-2,instance-3'
        # region for the EC2 instance
        - name: REGION
          value: 'us-east-1'
```

### CPU core with percentage consumption

It specifies the number of CPU cores that will be utilized (in terms of percentage) on the EC2 instance. Tune it by using the `CPU_CORE` and `CPU_LOAD` environment variables, respectively.

Use the following example to tune CPU core with percentage consumption:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/ec2-cpu-hog/cpu-core-with-percentage.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# CPU core with percentage to utilize
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: ec2-cpu-hog
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        - name: CPU_CORE
          value: '2'
        - name: CPU_LOAD
          value: '50'
        # ID of the EC2 instance
        - name: EC2_INSTANCE_ID
          value: 'instance-1'
        # region for the EC2 instance
        - name: REGION
          value: 'us-east-1'
```
