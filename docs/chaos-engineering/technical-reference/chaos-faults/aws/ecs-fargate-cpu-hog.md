title: ECS Fargate CPU Hog
---

The ECS Fargate CPU Hog experiment enables you to intentionally increase the CPU usage of an ECS task container for a defined period, allowing you to assess and test the container's performance under high CPU utilization conditions or latency caused due to it.
This experiment primarily involves ECS Fargate and doesnâ€™t depend on EC2 instances. [They](./ec2-and-serverless-faults#serverless-faults) focus on altering the state or resources of ECS containers without direct container interaction.

## Use cases
ECS Fargate CPU hog:
- Tests the behavior of your ECS tasks subjected to CPU stress, and validates the resilience and performance of your ECS tasks during the stress.
- Involves employing a sidecar container to augment the CPU utilization of an ECS task, which may result in latency issues impacting the performance of the main container.
- Validates the behavior of your application and infrastructure during a heavy CPU load, such as:
  - Testing the resilience of your system during stress, including verifying if the latency of the main container is increased and if the container fail to survive.

## Prerequisites
- Kubernetes >= 1.17
- ECS cluster running with the desired tasks and containers and familiarity with ECS service update and deployment concepts.
- Create a Kubernetes secret that has the AWS access configuration(key) in the `CHAOS_NAMESPACE`. Below is a sample secret file:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: cloud-secret
type: Opaque
stringData:
  cloud_config.yml: |-
    # Add the cloud AWS credentials respectively
    [default]
    aws_access_key_id = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    aws_secret_access_key = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

:::tip
HCE recommends that you use the same secret name, that is, `cloud-secret`. Otherwise, you will need to update the `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` environment variable in the fault template with the new secret name and you won't be able to use the default health check probes.

Below is an example AWS policy to execute the fault.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ecs:DescribeTasks",
                "ecs:DescribeServices",
                "ecs:DescribeTaskDefinition",
                "ecs:RegisterTaskDefinition",
                "ecs:UpdateService",
                "ecs:ListTasks",
                "ecs:DeregisterTaskDefinition"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "iam:PassRole"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

:::info note
- Refer to [AWS named profile for chaos](./security-configurations/aws-switch-profile.md) to know how to use a different profile for AWS faults.
- The ECS containers should be in a healthy state before and after introducing chaos.
Refer to the [common attributes](../common-tunables-for-all-faults) and [AWS-specific tunables](./aws-fault-tunables) to tune the common tunables for all faults and AWS-specific tunables.
- Refer to the [superset permission/policy](./security-configurations/policy-for-all-aws-faults.md) to execute all AWS faults.
