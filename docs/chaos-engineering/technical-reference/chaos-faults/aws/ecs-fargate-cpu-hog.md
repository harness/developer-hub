title: ECS Fargate CPU Hog
---

The ECS Fargate CPU Hog experiment enables you to intentionally increase the CPU usage of an ECS task container for a defined period, allowing you to assess and test the container's performance under high CPU utilization conditions or latency caused due to it.

:::tip
This experiment primarily involves ECS Fargate and doesnâ€™t depend on EC2 instances. [They](./ec2-and-serverless-faults#serverless-faults) focus on altering the state or resources of ECS containers without direct container interaction.
:::

## Use cases

- Tests the behavior of your ECS tasks subjected to CPU stress, and validates the resilience and performance of your ECS tasks during the stress.
- Involves employing a sidecar container to augment the CPU utilization of an ECS task, which may result in latency issues impacting the performance of the main container.
- Validates the behavior of your application and infrastructure during a heavy CPU load, such as:
  - Testing the resilience of your system during stress, including verifying if the latency of the main container is increased and if the container fail to survive.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes >= 1.17
- ECS cluster running with the desired tasks and containers and familiarity with ECS service update and deployment concepts.
- Create a Kubernetes secret that has the AWS access configuration(key) in the `CHAOS_NAMESPACE`. Below is a sample secret file:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: cloud-secret
type: Opaque
stringData:
  cloud_config.yml: |-
    # Add the cloud AWS credentials respectively
    [default]
    aws_access_key_id = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    aws_secret_access_key = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

:::tip
It is recommended to use the same secret name, that is, `cloud-secret`. Otherwise, you will need to update the `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` environment variable in the fault template and you may be unable to use the default health check probes.

## Permissions required

Here is an example AWS policy to execute the fault.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ecs:DescribeTasks",
                "ecs:DescribeServices",
                "ecs:DescribeTaskDefinition",
                "ecs:RegisterTaskDefinition",
                "ecs:UpdateService",
                "ecs:ListTasks",
                "ecs:DeregisterTaskDefinition"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "iam:PassRole"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```
:::info note
- Refer to [AWS named profile for chaos](./security-configurations/aws-switch-profile.md) to know how to use a different profile for AWS faults.
- The ECS containers should be in a healthy state before and after introducing chaos.
Refer to the [common attributes](../common-tunables-for-all-faults) and [AWS-specific tunables](./aws-fault-tunables) to tune the common tunables for all faults and AWS-specific tunables.
- Refer to the [superset permission/policy](./security-configurations/policy-for-all-aws-faults.md) to execute all AWS faults.
