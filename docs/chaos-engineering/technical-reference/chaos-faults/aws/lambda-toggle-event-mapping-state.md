## Introduction

Lambda toggle event mapping state toggles (or sets) the event source mapping state to `disable` for a Lambda function during a specific duration. Toggling between different states of event source mapping from a Lambda function may lead to failures when updating the database on an event trigger. This can break the service and impact its delivery.

## Use cases
Lambda toggle event mapping:
- Checks the performance of the running application when the event source mapping is not enabled. This may cause missing entries in a database.
- Determines if the application has proper error handling or auto recovery actions configured.


## Prerequisites
- Kubernetes >= 1.17
- AWS Lambda event source mapping must be healthy and attached to the Lambda function.
- Kubernetes secret must have the AWS access configuration(key) in the `CHAOS_NAMESPACE`. A secret file looks like this:
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Secret
  metadata:
    name: cloud-secret
  type: Opaque
  stringData:
    cloud_config.yml: |-
      # Add the cloud AWS credentials respectively
      [default]
      aws_access_key_id = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
      aws_secret_access_key = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
  ```

:::tip
HCE recommends that you use the same secret name, that is, `cloud-secret`. Otherwise, you will need to update the `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` environment variable in the fault template with the new secret name and you won't be able to use the default health check probes.

Below is an example AWS policy to execute the fault.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "lambda:ListEventSourceMappings",
                "lambda:DeleteEventSourceMapping",
                "lambda:UpdateEventSourceMapping",
                "lambda:CreateEventSourceMapping",
                "lambda:UpdateFunctionConfiguration",
                "lambda:GetFunctionConcurrency",
                "lambda:GetFunction",
                "lambda:DeleteFunctionConcurrency",
                "lambda:PutFunctionConcurrency"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

:::info note
- Go to [AWS named profile for chaos](./security-configurations/aws-switch-profile.md) to use a different profile for AWS faults.
- Go to [superset permission/policy](./security-configurations/policy-for-all-aws-faults.md) to execute all AWS faults.
- Go to [common tunables](../common-tunables-for-all-faults) and [AWS-specific tunables](./aws-fault-tunables) to tune the common tunables for all faults and AWS-specific tunables.

### Multiple event source mapping

Toggle between multiple event source mapping for a specific duration. Tune it by using `EVENT_UUIDS` environment variable that takes the UUID of the events as a comma-separated value.

The following YAML snippet illustrates the use of this environment variable:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/lambda-toggle-event-mapping-state/multiple-events.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# contains the removal of multiple event source mapping
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: lambda-toggle-event-mapping-state
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # provide UUIDS of event source mapping
        - name: EVENT_UUIDS
          value: 'id1,id2'
        # provide the function name for the chaos
        - name: FUNCTION_NAME
          value: 'chaos-function'
```
