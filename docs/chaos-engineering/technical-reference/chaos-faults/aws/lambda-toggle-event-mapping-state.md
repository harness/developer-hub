title: Lambda toggle event mapping state
---

Lambda toggle event mapping state toggles (or sets) the event source mapping state to `disable` for a Lambda function during a specific duration.
- It checks the performance of the running application (or service) when the event source mapping is not enabled which may cause missing entries in a database.

## Usage

<details>
<summary>View fault usage</summary>
<div>
Toggling between different states of event source mapping from a Lambda function may lead to failures in updating the database on an event trigger. This can break the service and impact its delivery. It helps determine if the application has proper error handling or auto recovery actions configured.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes >= 1.17
- AWS Lambda event source mapping attached to the lambda function.
- Kubernetes secret that has AWS access configuration(key) in the `CHAOS_NAMESPACE`. A secret file looks like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: cloud-secret
type: Opaque
stringData:
  cloud_config.yml: |-
    # Add the cloud AWS credentials respectively
    [default]
    aws_access_key_id = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    aws_secret_access_key = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

- It is recommended to use the same secret name, i.e. `cloud-secret`. Otherwise, you will need to update the `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` environment variable in the fault template and you may be unable to use the default health check probes. 

- Refer to [AWS Named Profile For Chaos](./security-configurations/aws-switch-profile.md) to know how to use a different profile for AWS faults.

## Permissions required

Here is an example AWS policy to execute the fault.

<details>
<summary>View policy for the fault</summary>

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "lambda:ListEventSourceMappings",
                "lambda:DeleteEventSourceMapping",
                "lambda:UpdateEventSourceMapping",
                "lambda:CreateEventSourceMapping",
                "lambda:UpdateFunctionConfiguration",
                "lambda:GetFunctionConcurrency",
                "lambda:GetFunction",
                "lambda:DeleteFunctionConcurrency",
                "lambda:PutFunctionConcurrency"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```
</details>

Refer to the [superset permission/policy](./security-configurations/policy-for-all-aws-faults.md) to execute all AWS faults.

## Default validations

The AWS Lambda event source mapping is healthy and attached to the lambda function.

## Fault examples

### Common and AWS-specific tunables

Refer to the [common attributes](../common-tunables-for-all-faults) and [AWS-specific tunables](./aws-fault-tunables) to tune the common tunables for all faults and aws specific tunables.

### Multiple event source mapping

It toggles between multiple event source mapping for a certain chaos duration using `EVENT_UUIDS` environment variable that takes the UUID of the events as a comma-separated value (CSV file).

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/lambda-toggle-event-mapping-state/multiple-events.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# contains the removal of multiple event source mapping
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: lambda-toggle-event-mapping-state
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # provide UUIDS of event source mapping
        - name: EVENT_UUIDS
          value: 'id1,id2'
        # provide the function name for the chaos
        - name: FUNCTION_NAME
          value: 'chaos-function'
```
