title: CLB AZ down
---

CLB AZ down takes down the AZ (Availability Zones) on a target CLB for a specific duration. This fault:
- Restricts access to certain availability zones for a specific duration.
- Tests the application sanity, availability, and recovery workflows of the application pod attached to the load balancer.

## Use cases

- CLB AZ down fault breaks the connectivity of a CLB with the given zones and impacts their delivery. 
- Detaching the AZ from the classic load balancer disrupts the dependent application's performance. 

:::note
- Kubernetes > 1.17 is required to execute this fault.
- Appropriate AWS access to attach or detach an AZ from CLB.
- There needs to be a minimum of one AZ attached to the CLB after injecting chaos; otherwise, the fault will fail to detach the given AZ.
- The CLB should be attached to the given availability zones.
- Kubernetes secret that has the AWS access configuration(key) in the `CHAOS_NAMESPACE`. Below is a sample secret file.
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: cloud-secret
type: Opaque
stringData:
  cloud_config.yml: |-
    # Add the cloud AWS credentials respectively
    [default]
    aws_access_key_id = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    aws_secret_access_key = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```
- It is recommended to use the same secret name, that is, `cloud-secret`. Otherwise, you will need to update the `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` environment variable in the fault template with the new secret name and you may be unable to use the default health check probes. 
- Refer to [AWS named profile for chaos](./security-configurations/aws-switch-profile.md) to know how to use a different profile for AWS faults.
:::

Below is an example AWS policy to execute the fault.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:DescribeInstanceStatus",
                "ec2:DescribeInstances",
                "ec2:DescribeSubnets",
                "elasticloadbalancing:DetachLoadBalancerFromSubnets",
                "elasticloadbalancing:AttachLoadBalancerToSubnets",
                "elasticloadbalancing:DescribeLoadBalancers"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```
Refer to the [superset permission or policy](./security-configurations/policy-for-all-aws-faults.md) to execute all AWS faults.

### Target zones

It contains the comma-separated list of target zones. Tune it by using the `ZONES` environment variable.

Use the following example to tune the target zones:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/clb-az-down/target-zones.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# contains clb az down for given zones
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: clb-az-down
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # load balancer name for chaos
        - name: LOAD_BALANCER_NAME
          value: 'tes-clb'
        # target zones for the chaos
        - name: ZONES
          value: 'us-east-1a,us-east-1b'
        # region for chaos
        - name: REGION
          value: 'us-east-1'
```
