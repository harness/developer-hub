ECS invalid container image allows you to update the Docker image used by a container in an Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) task. 

![ECS Invalid Container Image](./static/images/ecs-invalid-container-image.png)

:::tip
This experiment primarily involves ECS Fargate and doesnâ€™t depend on EC2 instances. [They](./ec2-and-serverless-faults#serverless-faults) focus on altering the state or resources of ECS containers without direct container interaction.
:::

## Use cases
ECS invalid container image:
- Tests the behavior of your ECS tasks when the container images are updated, and validates the resilience and performance of your ECS tasks during image updates.
- Updates the Docker image of a container by modifying the task definition associated with the ECS service or task. 
- Simulates scenarios where container images are updated, that may impact the behavior of your application or infrastructure. For example, you can update the Docker image of a container to a newer version or a different image to test how your application handles image updates.
- Validates the behavior of your application and infrastructure during simulated container image updates, such as:
  - Testing the resilience of your system during image updates, including verifying if the updated image is pulled successfully and if the container starts with the new image.
  - Validating the performance and availability of your application after the container image updates, that includes checking if the updated image performs as expected and if there are issues with the new image.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes >= 1.17
- ECS cluster running with the desired tasks and containers and familiarity with ECS service update and deployment concepts.
- Create a Kubernetes secret that has the AWS access configuration(key) in the `CHAOS_NAMESPACE`. Below is a sample secret file:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: cloud-secret
type: Opaque
stringData:
  cloud_config.yml: |-
    # Add the cloud AWS credentials respectively
    [default]
    aws_access_key_id = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    aws_secret_access_key = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

:::tip
It is recommended to use the same secret name, that is, `cloud-secret`. Otherwise, you will need to update the `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` environment variable in the fault template and you may be unable to use the default health check probes.

## Permissions required

Here is an example AWS policy to execute the fault.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ecs:DescribeTasks",
                "ecs:DescribeServices",
                "ecs:DescribeTaskDefinition",
                "ecs:RegisterTaskDefinition",
                "ecs:UpdateService",
                "ecs:ListTasks",
                "ecs:DeregisterTaskDefinition"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "iam:PassRole"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```
:::info note
- Refer to [AWS named profile for chaos](./security-configurations/aws-switch-profile.md) to know how to use a different profile for AWS faults.
- The ECS containers should be in a healthy state before and after introducing chaos.
Refer to the [common attributes](../common-tunables-for-all-faults) and [AWS-specific tunables](./aws-fault-tunables) to tune the common tunables for all faults and AWS-specific tunables.
- Refer to the [superset permission/policy](./security-configurations/policy-for-all-aws-faults.md) to execute all AWS faults.

### Invalid ECS container image

Invalid image used for the ECS task containers. Tune it by using the `IMAGE` environment variable.

The following YAML snippet illustrates the use of this environment variable:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/ecs-invalid-container-image/image.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# Set container image for the target ECS task
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: aws-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: ecs-invalid-container-image
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        - name: IMAGE
          value: 'nginx'
        - name: REGION
          value: 'us-east-2'
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          VALUE: '60'
```
