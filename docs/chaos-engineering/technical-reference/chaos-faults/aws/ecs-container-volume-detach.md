title: ECS Container Volume Detach
---

ECS container volume detach provides a mechanism to detach and remove volumes associated with ECS task containers in an Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) task.

:::tip
This experiment primarily involves ECS Fargate and doesnâ€™t depend on EC2 instances. [They](./ec2-and-serverless-faults#serverless-faults) focus on altering the state or resources of ECS containers without direct container interaction.
:::

## Use cases

- This experiment allows you to test and validate the behavior of your ECS tasks when volumes are detached. You can verify the resilience and performance of your application during volume detachment scenarios, ensuring that the containers continue to function as expected.
- By detaching volumes, you can safely remove the volume associations from the containers without deleting the volumes themselves. 
- By detaching unnecessary volumes, you can optimize the resource utilization within your ECS tasks. This helps to free up storage space and minimize any potential performance impact associated with unused volumes.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes >= 1.17
- ECS cluster running with the desired tasks and containers and familiarity with ECS service update and deployment concepts.
- Create a Kubernetes secret that has the AWS access configuration(key) in the `CHAOS_NAMESPACE`. Below is a sample secret file:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: cloud-secret
type: Opaque
stringData:
  cloud_config.yml: |-
    # Add the cloud AWS credentials respectively
    [default]
    aws_access_key_id = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    aws_secret_access_key = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

:::tip
It is recommended to use the same secret name, that is, `cloud-secret`. Otherwise, you will need to update the `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` environment variable in the fault template and you may be unable to use the default health check probes.

## Permissions required

Here is an example AWS policy to execute the fault.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ecs:DescribeTasks",
                "ecs:DescribeServices",
                "ecs:DescribeTaskDefinition",
                "ecs:RegisterTaskDefinition",
                "ecs:UpdateService",
                "ecs:ListTasks",
                "ecs:DeregisterTaskDefinition"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "iam:PassRole"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```
:::info note
- Refer to [AWS named profile for chaos](./security-configurations/aws-switch-profile.md) to know how to use a different profile for AWS faults.
- The ECS containers should be in a healthy state before and after introducing chaos.
Refer to the [common attributes](../common-tunables-for-all-faults) and [AWS-specific tunables](./aws-fault-tunables) to tune the common tunables for all faults and AWS-specific tunables.
- Refer to the [superset permission/policy](./security-configurations/policy-for-all-aws-faults.md) to execute all AWS faults.

### ECS Container Volume Detach

ECS container volume chaos will detach the volumes for specified chaos duration. Tune it by using the `SERVICE_NAME` and `CLUSTER_NAME` environment variable.

The following YAML snippet illustrates the use of this environment variable:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/ecs-container-volume-detach/volume-detach.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# Set container image for the target ECS task
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: aws-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: ecs-container-volume-detach
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        - name: CLUSTER_NAME
          value: 'test-cluster'
        - name: SERVICE_NAME
          value: 'test-service'
        - name: REGION
          value: 'us-east-2'
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          VALUE: '60'
```
