title: ECS container network latency
---

ECS container network latency disrupts the state of infrastructure resources. It brings delay on the AWS ECS container using Amazon SSM Run command, which is carried out using SSM docs which is in-built into the fault.
- It causes network stress on the containers of the ECS task using the given `CLUSTER_NAME` environment variable for a specific duration.
- To select the Task Under Chaos (TUC), use the service name associated with the task. If you provide the service name along with the cluster name, all the tasks associated with the given service will be selected as chaos targets.
- It tests the ECS task sanity (service availability) and recovery of the task containers subject to network stress.
- This experiment induces chaos within a container and depends on an EC2 instance. Typically, these are prefixed with ["ECS container"](./ec2-and-serverless-faults#ec2-backed-faults) and involve direct interaction with the EC2 instances hosting the ECS containers.

## Use cases

This fault degrades the network of the task container without the container being marked as unhealthy/ (or unworthy) of traffic. It simulates issues within the ECS task network or communication across services in different availability zones (or regions).
This can be resolved using middleware that switches traffic based on certain SLOs (or performance parameters).
This can also be resolved by highlighting the degradation using notifications (or alerts).
It also determines the impact of the fault on the microservice. 
The task may stall or get corrupted while waiting endlessly for a packet. The fault limits the impact (blast radius) to only the traffic you wish to test by specifying the service to find TUC (Task Under Chaos). This fault helps improve the resilience of the services over time.


## Prerequisites
- Kubernetes >= 1.17
- Adequate AWS access to stop and start an EC2 instance.
- Create a Kubernetes secret that has the AWS access configuration(key) in the `CHAOS_NAMESPACE`. Below is a sample secret file:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: cloud-secret
type: Opaque
stringData:
  cloud_config.yml: |-
    # Add the cloud AWS credentials respectively
    [default]
    aws_access_key_id = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    aws_secret_access_key = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

:::tip
HCE recommends that you use the same secret name, that is, `cloud-secret`. Otherwise, you will need to update the `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` environment variable in the fault template with the new secret name and you won't be able to use the default health check probes.

Below is an example AWS policy to execute the fault.

:::info note
- The ECS container instance should be in a healthy state.
- Refer to [AWS Named Profile For Chaos](./security-configurations/aws-switch-profile.md) to know how to use a different profile for AWS faults.
- Refer to the [superset permission/policy](./security-configurations/policy-for-all-aws-faults.md) to execute all AWS faults.

### Network latency

Delay (in ms) to be injected in the target container. Tune it by using the `NETWORK_LATENCY` environment variable.

The following YAML snippet illustrates the use of this environment variable:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/ecs-network-chaos/network-latency.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# injects network latency for a certain chaos duration
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: ecs-container-network-latency
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # network latency to be injected
        - name: NETWORK_LATENCY
          value: '2000' #in ms
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          value: '60'
```

### Network interface

Name of the ethernet interface considered for shaping traffic. Tune it by using the `NETWORK_INTERFACE` environment variable. Its default value is `eth0`.

The following YAML snippet illustrates the use of this environment variable:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/ecs-network-chaos/latency-network-interface.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# provide the network interface
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: ecs-container-network-latency
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # name of the network interface
        - name: NETWORK_INTERFACE
          value: 'eth0'
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          value: '60'
```

### Jitter

Jitter (in ms), a parameter that allows introducing a network delay variation. Tune it by using the `JITTER` environment variable. Its default value is `0`.

The following YAML snippet illustrates the use of this environment variable:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/ecs-network-chaos/jitter.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# provide the network latency jitter
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: ecs-container-network-latency
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # value of the network latency jitter (in ms)
        - name: JITTER
          value: '200'
```

### Destination IPs and destination hosts

The network faults interrupt traffic for all the IPs/hosts by default. Tune the interruption of specific IPs/Hosts using `DESTINATION_IPS` and `DESTINATION_HOSTS` environment variables.

- `DESTINATION_IPS`: It contains the IP addresses of the services or pods or the CIDR blocks(range of IPs), the accessibility to which is impacted.
- `DESTINATION_HOSTS`: It contains the DNS Names/FQDN names of the services, the accessibility to which, is impacted.

The following YAML snippet illustrates the use of this environment variable:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/ecs-network-chaos/latency-destination-ip-and-hosts.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# it inject the chaos for the egress traffic for specific ips/hosts
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: ecs-container-network-latency
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # supports comma-separated destination ips
        - name: DESTINATION_IPS
          value: '8.8.8.8,192.168.5.6'
        # supports comma-separated destination hosts
        - name: DESTINATION_HOSTS
          value: 'nginx.default.svc.cluster.local,google.com'
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          value: '60'
```
