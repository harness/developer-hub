title: ECS container HTTP reset peer
---

ECS container HTTP reset peer injects HTTP reset on the service whose port is specified using the `TARGET_SERVICE_PORT` environment variable.
- It stops the outgoing HTTP requests by resetting the TCP connection for the requests.
- It determines the application's resilience to a lossy (or flaky) HTTP connection.

![ECS Container HTTP Reset Peer](./static/images/ecs-container-http-reset-peer.png)

:::tip
This experiment induces chaos within a container and depends on an EC2 instance. Typically, these are prefixed with ["ECS container"](./ec2-and-serverless-faults#ec2-backed-faults) and involve direct interaction with the EC2 instances hosting the ECS containers.
:::

## Use cases
ECS container HTTP reset peer:
- Simulates premature connection loss (firewall issues or other issues) between microservices (verify connection timeout).
- Simulates connection resets due to resource limitations on the server side like out of memory server (or process killed or overload on the server due to a high amount of traffic). 

## Prerequisites
- Kubernetes >= 1.17
- ECS container metadata is enabled (disabled by default). To enable it, go to [container metadata](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/container-metadata.html). If your task is currently running, you may need to restart it to get the metadata directory.
- ECS cluster running with the desired tasks and containers and familiarity with ECS service update and deployment concepts.
- Access to the ECS cluster instances with the necessary permissions to update the start and stop timeouts for containers. Refer to [systems manager docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/setup-launch-managed-instance.html).
- Backup and recovery mechanisms in place to handle potential failures during the testing process.
- You and the ECS cluster instances have a role with the required AWS access to perform the SSM and ECS operations.
- Kubernetes secret with AWS Access Key ID and secret access key credentials in the `CHAOS_NAMESPACE`. Below is the sample secret file:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: cloud-secret
type: Opaque
stringData:
  cloud_config.yml: |-
    # Add the cloud AWS credentials respectively
    [default]
    aws_access_key_id = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    aws_secret_access_key = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

- It is recommended to use the same secret name, that is, `cloud-secret`. Otherwise, you will need to update the `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` environment variable in the fault template and you may be unable to use the default health check probes. 

:::info note
- You can pass the VM credentials as secrets or as a `ChaosEngine` environment variable.
- The ECS container should be in a healthy state before and after introducing chaos.
- Refer to the [superset permission or policy](./security-configurations/policy-for-all-aws-faults.md) to execute all AWS faults.
- Refer to the [common attributes](../common-tunables-for-all-faults) to tune the common tunables for all the faults.
- Refer to [AWS named profile for chaos](./security-configurations/aws-switch-profile.md) to use a different profile for AWS faults.
