ECS update task role allows you to modify the IAM task role associated with an Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) task.

![ECS Update Task Role](./static/images/ecs-update-task-role.png)

:::tip
This experiment primarily involves ECS Fargate and doesnâ€™t depend on EC2 instances. [They](./ec2-and-serverless-faults#serverless-faults) focus on altering the state or resources of ECS containers without direct container interaction.
:::

## Use cases
ECS update task role:
- Determines the behavior of your ECS tasks when their IAM role is changed.
- Verifies the authorization and access permissions of your ECS tasks under different IAM configurations.
- Modifies the IAM task role associated with a container task by updating the task definition associated with the ECS service or task. 
- Simulate scenarios where the IAM role associated with a task is changed, which may impact the authorization and access permissions of the containers running in the task.
- Validates the behavior of your application and infrastructure during simulated IAM role changes, such as:
  - Testing how your application handles changes in IAM role permissions and access.
  - Verifying the authorization settings of your system when the IAM role is updated.
  - Evaluating the impact of changes in IAM roles on the security and compliance of your application.

:::warning
Modifying the IAM task role using the ECS update task role is an intentional disruption and should be used carefully in controlled environments.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes >= 1.17
- ECS cluster running with the desired tasks and containers and familiarity with ECS service update and deployment concepts.
- Create a Kubernetes secret that has the AWS access configuration(key) in the `CHAOS_NAMESPACE`. Below is a sample secret file:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: cloud-secret
type: Opaque
stringData:
  cloud_config.yml: |-
    # Add the cloud AWS credentials respectively
    [default]
    aws_access_key_id = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    aws_secret_access_key = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

:::tip
It is recommended to use the same secret name, that is, `cloud-secret`. Otherwise, you will need to update the `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` environment variable in the fault template and you may be unable to use the default health check probes. 
:::

## Permissions required

Here is an example AWS policy to execute the fault.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ecs:DescribeTasks",
                "ecs:DescribeServices",
                "ecs:DescribeTaskDefinition",
                "ecs:RegisterTaskDefinition",
                "ecs:UpdateService",
                "ecs:ListTasks",
                "ecs:DeregisterTaskDefinition"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "iam:PassRole"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

:::info note
- Refer to [AWS named profile for chaos](./security-configurations/aws-switch-profile.md) to use a different profile for AWS faults.
- The ECS containers should be in a healthy state before and after introducing chaos.
- Refer to the [common attributes](../common-tunables-for-all-faults) and [AWS-specific tunables](./aws-fault-tunables) to tune the common tunables for all faults and AWS-specific tunables.
- Refer to the [superset permission/policy](./security-configurations/policy-for-all-aws-faults.md) to execute all AWS faults.

### Task role specification

Task role for the ECS task containers. Tune it by using the `TASK_ROLE` environment variable.

The following YAML snippet illustrates the use of this environment variable:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/ecs-update-task-role/task-role.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# Set task role resource for the target task
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: aws-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: ecs-update-task-role
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        - name: TASK_ROLE
          value: 'arn:aws:iam::149554801296:role/ecsTaskExecutionRole'
        - name: REGION
          value: 'us-east-2'
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          VALUE: '60'
```
