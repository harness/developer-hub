title: ECS task stop
---
ECS task stop is an AWS fault that injects chaos to stop the ECS tasks based on the services or task replica ID and checks the task availability.
- This fault results in the unavailability of the application running on the tasks.
- This experiment is applicable to both serverless ECS tasks and those backed by EC2 instances. [These experiments](./ec2-and-serverless-faults#ec2-backed-and-serverless-faults) generally involve task-level chaos or access restrictions without causing direct in-container or in-VM disruptions.

## Use cases

This fault determines the resilience of an application when ECS tasks unexpectedly stop due to task being unavailable.

## Prerequisites
- Kubernetes >= 1.17
- Sufficient AWS access to stop the ECS tasks.
- The target ECS tasks should be in a healthy state.
- Kubernetes secret that has the AWS access configuration (key) in the `CHAOS_NAMESPACE`. Below is a sample secret file:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: cloud-secret
type: Opaque
stringData:
  cloud_config.yml: |-
    # Add the cloud AWS credentials respectively
    [default]
    aws_access_key_id = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    aws_secret_access_key = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

:::tip
HCE recommends that you use the same secret name, that is, `cloud-secret`. Otherwise, you will need to update the `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` environment variable in the fault template with the new secret name and you won't be able to use the default health check probes.

Below is an example AWS policy to help execute the fault.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ecs:ListServices",
                "ecs:ListTasks",
                "ecs:StopTask",
                "ecs:DescribeServices",
                "ecs:DescribeTasks"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

:::info note
- Refer to [AWS Named Profile For Chaos](./security-configurations/aws-switch-profile.md) to know how to use a different profile for AWS faults.
- Refer to the [superset permission (or policy)](./security-configurations/policy-for-all-aws-faults.md) to execute all AWS faults.
- Refer to the [common attributes](../common-tunables-for-all-faults) and [AWS-specific tunables](./aws-fault-tunables) to tune the common tunables for all faults and aws specific tunables.

### ECS service name

Service name whose tasks are stopped. Tune it by using the `SERVICE_NAME` environment variable. 

The following YAML snippet illustrates the use of this environment variable:

        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          VALUE: '60'
```

### ECS task replica affected percentage

Number of tasks to target (in percentage). Tune it by using the `TASK_REPLICA_AFFECTED_PERC` environment variable.

The following YAML snippet illustrates the use of this environment variable:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/ecs-task-stop/task-stop-task-affected.yaml yaml)
