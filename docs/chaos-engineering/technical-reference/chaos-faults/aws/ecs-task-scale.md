---
ECS task scale is an AWS fault that injects chaos to scale (up or down) the ECS tasks based on the services and checks the task availability. This fault affects the availability of a task in an ECS cluster.

## Use cases
ECS task scale:
- Affects the availability of a task in a cluster. 
- Determines the resilience of an application when ECS tasks are unexpectedly scaled up (or down).

## Prerequisites
- Kubernetes >= 1.17
- [Sufficient AWS permissions to scale the ECS tasks](#permissions-required).
- The target ECS tasks should be in a healthy state.
- Kubernetes secret that has the AWS access configuration (key) in the `CHAOS_NAMESPACE`. Below is a sample secret file:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: cloud-secret
type: Opaque
stringData:
  cloud_config.yml: |-
    # Add the cloud AWS credentials respectively
    [default]
    aws_access_key_id = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    aws_secret_access_key = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

:::tip
HCE recommends that you use the same secret name, that is, `cloud-secret`. Otherwise, you will need to update the `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` environment variable in the fault template with the new secret name and you won't be able to use the default health check probes. 
:::

Below is an example AWS permission to help execute the fault.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ecs:ListServices",
                "ecs:DescribeServices",
                "ecs:UpdateService"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

:::info note
- Refer to [AWS Named Profile For Chaos](./security-configurations/aws-switch-profile.md) to know how to use a different profile for AWS faults.
- Refer to the [superset permission (or policy)](./security-configurations/policy-for-all-aws-faults.md) to execute all AWS faults.
- Refer to the [common attributes](../common-tunables-for-all-faults) and [AWS-specific tunables](./aws-fault-tunables) to tune the common tunables for all faults and aws specific tunables.

### ECS service name

Comma-separated serice names that derives the task. Tune it by using the `SERVICE_NAMES` environment variable. 

The following YAML snippet illustrates the use of this environment variable:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/ecs-task-scale/task-service-name.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# scale the tasks of an ECS cluster
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: ecs-task-scale
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # provide the name of ECS cluster
        - name: CLUSTER_NAME
          value: 'demo'
        - name: SERVICE_NAMES
          value: 'test-svc'
```

### ECS task replicas

Number of replicas to scale up (or down) to. Tune it by using the `REPLICAS` environment variable.

The following YAML snippet illustrates the use of this environment variable:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/ecs-task-scale/task-replicas.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# scale the tasks of an ECS cluster
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: ecs-task-scale
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # provide the number of replicas
        - name: REPLICAS
          value: '5'
```
