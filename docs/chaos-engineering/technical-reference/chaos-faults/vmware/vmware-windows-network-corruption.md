title: VMware Windows Network Corruption
---

VMware Windows Network Corruption simulates a network corruption scenario on Windows OS based VMware VM.
- It checks the performance of the application running on the VMware Windows VMs under network corruption conditions.

## Use cases

- VMware Windows Network Corruption determines the resilience of an application when a network corruption scenario is simulated on a VMware Windows virtual machine.
- VMware Windows Network Corruption simulates the situation of network corruption on the application, which degrades their performance. 
- It also helps verify the application's ability to handle network failures and its failover mechanisms. 

:::note
- Kubernetes > 1.16 is required to execute this fault.
- Execution plane should be connected to vCenter and host vCenter on port 443. 
- VMware tool should be installed on the target VM with remote execution enabled.
- Adequate vCenter permissions should be provided to access the hosts and the VMs.
- The VM should be in a healthy state before and after injecting chaos.
- Kubernetes secret has to be created that has the Vcenter credentials in the `CHAOS_NAMESPACE`. 
- Verify [clumsy](https://jagt.github.io/clumsy/download.html) is installed on the VM, as it's essential for this experiment.
- Run the fault with a user possessing admin rights, preferably the built-in Administrator, to guarantee permissions for memory stress testing. [See how to enable the built-in Administrator in Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/enable-and-disable-the-built-in-administrator-account?view=windows-11).

- VM credentials can be passed as secrets or as a chaos enginer environment variable.

### Destination hosts

The `DESTINATION_HOSTS` environment variable specifies the destination hosts to corrupt on the target Windows VM.

Use the following example to specify destination hosts:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/vmware-windows-network-corruption/vm-network-corruption-destination-hosts.yaml yaml)
```yaml
