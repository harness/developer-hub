title: VMware VM power off
---

VMware VM poweroff stops (or powers off) the VMware VMs for a specific duration.
- After the duration, the VMs are back to original state.
- It checks the performance of the application running on the VMware VMs.

![VMware VM Poweroff](./static/images/vmware-vm-poweroff.png)

## Use cases

- VMware VM poweroff determines the resilience of an application to random power failures. 
- It determines how efficiently an application recovers and restarts the services.

:::note
- Kubernetes >= 1.17 is required to execute this fault.
- Appropriate vCenter permissions should be provided to start and stop the VMs.
- The VM should be in a healthy state before and after injecting chaos.
- Kubernetes secret has to be created that has the Vcenter credentials in the `CHAOS_NAMESPACE`. VM credentials can be passed as secrets or as a `ChaosEngine` environment variable. Below is a sample secret file:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: vcenter-secret
  namespace: litmus
type: Opaque
stringData:
    VCENTERSERVER: XXXXXXXXXXX
    VCENTERUSER: XXXXXXXXXXXXX
    VCENTERPASS: XXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

### Stop/Poweroff the VM by MOID

It contains the MOID of the VM instance. Tune it by using the `APP_VM_MOIDS` environment variable.

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/vm-poweroff/app-vm-moid.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# power-off the VMware VM
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: vm-poweroff
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # MOID of the VM
        - name: APP_VM_MOIDS
          value: 'vm-53,vm-65'
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          VALUE: '60'
```
