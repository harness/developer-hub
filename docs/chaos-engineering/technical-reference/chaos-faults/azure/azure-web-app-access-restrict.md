title: Azure web app access restrict
---
Azure web app access restrict causes a split brain condition by restricting the access to an application service instance.
- This fault checks if the requests have been serviced and recovery is automated after the restrictions have been lifted.
- It checks the performance of the application (or process) running on the instance.

## Use cases

Azure web app access restrict determines the resilience of an application when access to a specific application service instance is restricted.

:::note
- Kubernetes > 1.16 is required to execute this fault.
- Appropriate Azure access to the web applications.
- The target Azure web application should be in the running state.
- Use Azure [ file-based authentication ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/go/azure-sdk-authorization#use-file-based-authentication) to connect to the instance using Azure GO SDK. To generate the auth file, run `az ad sp create-for-rbac --sdk-auth > azure.auth` Azure CLI command.
- Kubernetes secret should contain the auth file created in the previous step in the `CHAOS_NAMESPACE`. Below is a sample secret file:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: cloud-secret
type: Opaque
stringData:
  azure.auth: |-
    {
      "clientId": "XXXXXXXXX",
      "clientSecret": "XXXXXXXXX",
      "subscriptionId": "XXXXXXXXX",
      "tenantId": "XXXXXXXXX",
      "activeDirectoryEndpointUrl": "XXXXXXXXX",
      "resourceManagerEndpointUrl": "XXXXXXXXX",
      "activeDirectoryGraphResourceId": "XXXXXXXXX",
      "sqlManagementEndpointUrl": "XXXXXXXXX",
      "galleryEndpointUrl": "XXXXXXXXX",
      "managementEndpointUrl": "XXXXXXXXX"
    }
```
- If you change the secret key name from `azure.auth` to a new name, ensure that you update the `AZURE_AUTH_LOCATION` environment variable in the chaos experiment with the new name.

### Web app access restrict by name

It specifies a comma-separated list of web application names subject to chaos. Tune it by using the `AZURE_WEB_APP_NAMES` environment variable.

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/azure-web-access-restrict/azure-web-app-name.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# access restrict on target web app by their names
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: azure-web-access-restrict
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # comma separated names of the target web apps
        - name: AZURE_WEB_APP_NAMES
          value: 'webApp-01,webApp-02'
        # name of the resource group
        - name: RESOURCE_GROUP
          value: 'chaos-rg'
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          VALUE: '60'
```


### Access restrict for a certain CIDR range

It specifies a CIDR range used in the rule. Tune it by using the `IP_ADDRESS_BLOCK` environment variable.

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/azure-web-access-restrict/ip-address-block.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# restrict the web app for a certain 
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: azure-web-access-restrict
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # provide the value of ip address/CIDR Range
        - name: IP_ADDRESS_BLOCK
          value: '0.0.0.0/0'
        # name of the resource group
        - name: RESOURCE_GROUP
          value: 'chaos-rg'
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          VALUE: '60'
```

### Access restrict with action

It specifies whether to allow or deny the traffic for the rule provided. Tune it by using the `ACTION` environment variable. By default, it is set to `deny`.

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/azure-web-access-restrict/action.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# defines the action for the given network rule
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: azure-web-access-restrict
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # Provide the action for a rule
        - name: ACTION
          value: 'deny'
         # duration for the chaos execution
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          VALUE: '60'
```

### Access restrict with priority

It specifies the priority of the network rule created by the fault. Tune it by using the `PRIORITY` environment variable. By default, it is set to 300.

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/azure-web-access-restrict/priority.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# defines the priority for the network rule
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: azure-web-access-restrict
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # Provide the priority for a rule
        - name: PRIORITY
          value: '300'
         # duration for the chaos execution
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          VALUE: '60'
```

### Access restrict with custom rule name

It specifies a custom rule name for the chaos. Tune it by using the `RULE_NAME` environment variable.

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/azure-web-access-restrict/rule-name.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# defines the rule name for the network rule created
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: azure-web-access-restrict
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # Provide the name of the rule
        - name: RULE_NAME
          value: 'chaos-rule'
```
