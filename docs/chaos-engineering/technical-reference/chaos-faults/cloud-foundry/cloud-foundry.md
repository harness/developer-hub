<!-- Heading Description -->
## Introduction

Cloud Foundry faults disrupt the functioning of Cloud Foundry resources. This deteriorates the performance of the app for the duration of the chaos experiment.

### CF app stop

CF app stop injects app stop chaos for a Cloud Foundry app.

- Checks resilience against abrupt stop of application components/microservices.
- Validates the effectiveness of disaster recovery and high availability of the app.

### CF app route unmap

CF app route unmap temporarily unmaps a Cloud Foundry app route and later maps it back to the app.

- Checks resilience against abrupt un-mapping of an app route.
- Validates the effectiveness of disaster recovery and high availability of the app.
