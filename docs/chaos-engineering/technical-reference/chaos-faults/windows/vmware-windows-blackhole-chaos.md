title: VMware Windows Blackhole Chaos
---

VMware Windows Blackhole Chaos simulates a network blackhole scenario on Windows OS based VMware VM.
- It checks the performance of the application running on the VMware Windows VMs under network blackhole conditions.

## Use cases

- VMware Windows Blackhole Chaos determines the resilience of an application when a network blackhole scenario is simulated on a VMware Windows virtual machine.
- VMware Windows Blackhole Chaos simulates the situation of network isolation for processes running on the application, which degrades their performance.
- It also helps verify the application's ability to handle network failures and its failover mechanisms. 

:::note
- Kubernetes > 1.16 is required to execute this fault.
- Execution plane should be connected to vCenter and host vCenter on port 443. 
- VMware tool should be installed on the target VM with remote execution enabled.
- Adequate vCenter permissions should be provided to access the hosts and the VMs.
- Ensure the firewall is active and permissions to modify its rules are granted. Consider using the built-in Administrator user. [Learn how to enable it in Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/enable-and-disable-the-built-in-administrator-account?view=windows-11).
- The VM should be in a healthy state before and after injecting chaos.
- Kubernetes secret has to be created that has the Vcenter credentials in the `CHAOS_NAMESPACE`. 
- VM credentials can be passed as secrets or as a chaos enginer environment variable.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: vcenter-secret
  namespace: litmus
type: Opaque
stringData:
    VCENTERSERVER: XXXXXXXXXXX
    VCENTERUSER: XXXXXXXXXXXXX
    VCENTERPASS: XXXXXXXXXXXXX

### Destination hosts
The `DESTINATION_HOSTS` environment variable specifies the destination hosts to block on the target Windows VM.

Use the following example to specify destination hosts:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/vmware-windows-blackhole-chaos/vm-blackhole-chaos-destination-hosts.yaml yaml)
```yaml
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: vmware-windows-blackhole-chaos
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # Name of the VM
        - name: VM_NAME
          value: 'test-vm-01'
       # Destination hosts to block
        - name: DESTINATION_HOSTS 
          value: 'github.com'
```

### IP addresses
The `IP_ADDRESSES` environment variable specifies the IP addresses to block on the target Windows VM.

Use the following example to specify IP addresses:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/vmware-windows-blackhole-chaos/vm-blackhole-chaos-ip-addresses.yaml yaml)

```yaml
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: vmware-windows-blackhole-chaos
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # Name of the VM
        - name: VM_NAME
          value: 'test-vm-01'
       # IP addresses to block
        - name: IP_ADDRESSES 
          value: '10.0.0.1,10.0.0.2'
```
