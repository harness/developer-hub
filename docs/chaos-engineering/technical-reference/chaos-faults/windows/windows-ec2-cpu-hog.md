## Introduction

EC2 windows CPU hog induces CPU stress on the AWS Windows EC2 instances using Amazon SSM Run command. The SSM Run command is executed using SSM documentation that is built into the fault.

## Use cases

EC2 windows CPU hog:
- Simulates the situation of a lack of CPU for processes running on the instance, which degrades their performance. 
- Simulates slow application traffic or exhaustion of the resources, leading to degradation in the performance of processes on the instance.

:::info note
- Kubernetes version 1.17 or later is required to execute this fault.
- The EC2 instance must be in a healthy state.
- SSM agent must be installed and running on the target EC2 instance.
- SSM IAM role must be attached to the target EC2 instance(s).
- Kubernetes secret must have the AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key credentials in the `CHAOS_NAMESPACE`. Below is a sample secret file:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: cloud-secret
    type: Opaque
    stringData:
      cloud_config.yml: |-
        # Add the cloud AWS credentials respectively
        [default]
        aws_access_key_id = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
        aws_secret_access_key = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    ```
- Harness recommends using the same secret name, that is, `cloud-secret`. Otherwise, you must update the `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` environment variable in the fault template and you won't be able to use the default health check probes.
- Go to [AWS named profile for chaos](../aws/security-configurations/aws-switch-profile.md) to use a different profile for AWS faults.
- Go to [superset permission/policy](../aws/security-configurations/policy-for-all-aws-faults.md) to execute all AWS faults.

Here is an example AWS policy to execute the fault.

### CPU core

Number of CPU cores utilized on the EC2 instance. Tune it by using the `CPU_CORE` environment variable. All available CPU cores can be consumed by setting this variable to `0`.

The following YAML snippet illustrates the use of this environment variable:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/windows-ec2-cpu-hog/cpu-core.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# CPU cores to utilize
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: windows-ec2-cpu-hog
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        - name: CPU_CORE
          VALUE: '2'
        # ID of the EC2 instance
        - name: EC2_INSTANCE_ID
          value: 'instance-1'
        # region for the EC2 instance
        - name: REGION
          value: 'us-east-1'
```

### Multiple EC2 instances

Multiple EC2 instances specified as comma-separated IDs targeted in one chaos run. Tune it by using the `EC2_INSTANCE_ID` environment variable.

The following YAML snippet illustrates the use of this environment variable:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/windows-ec2-cpu-hog/multiple-instances.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# mutilple instance targets
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: windows-ec2-cpu-hog
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # ids of the EC2 instances
        - name: EC2_INSTANCE_ID
          value: 'instance-1,instance-2,instance-3'
        # region for the EC2 instance
        - name: REGION
          value: 'us-east-1'
```
