## Introduction

Windows faults disrupt the resources running on a Windows OS based machine. This deteriorates the performance of the application for the duration of the chaos experiment. Depending on the type of instance the fault targets, Windows faults are categorized into various types.

### Windows EC2 blackhole chaos

Windows EC2 blackhole chaos results in access loss to the given target hosts or IPs by injecting firewall rules.

<Accordion color="green">
<summary>Use cases</summary>
    
Windows EC2 blackhole chaos:
- Degrades the network without the EC2 instance being marked as unhealthy (or unworthy) of traffic. This can be resolved by using a middleware that switches the traffic based on certain SLOs (performance parameters). 
- Limits the impact, that is, blast radius to only the traffic that you wish to test, by specifying the destination hosts or IP addresses.

</Accordion>
</FaultDetailsCard>

<FaultDetailsCard category="windows">

### Windows EC2 CPU hog

EC2 windows CPU hog induces CPU stress on the AWS Windows EC2 instances using Amazon SSM Run command.

<Accordion color="green">
<summary>Use cases</summary>

EC2 windows CPU hog:

- Simulates the situation of a lack of CPU for processes running on the instance, which degrades their performance.
- Simulates slow application traffic or exhaustion of the resources, leading to degradation in the performance of processes on the instance.

</Accordion>
</FaultDetailsCard>

<FaultDetailsCard category="windows">

### Windows EC2 memory hog

Windows EC2 memory hog induces memory stress on the target AWS Windows EC2 instance using Amazon SSM Run command.

<Accordion color="green">
<summary>Use cases</summary>

Windows EC2 memory hog:

- Causes memory stress on the target AWS EC2 instance(s).
- Simulates the situation of memory leaks in the deployment of microservices.
- Simulates application slowness due to memory starvation, and noisy neighbour problems due to hogging.
