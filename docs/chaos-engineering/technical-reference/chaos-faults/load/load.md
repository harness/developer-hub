## Introduction

Loadgen faults disrupt the state of the application by applying a heavy load on the target hosts. They can be categorized into different types based on the loadgen mechanism used in them.

### Locust loadgen

Locust loadgen fault simulates load generation on the target hosts for a specific chaos duration. This fault:

- Slows down or makes the target host unavailable due to heavy load.
- Checks the performance of the application or process running on the instance.

This fault determines the resilience of the application under a generated load. It determines how quickly the application scales or recovers to avoid such failure.
