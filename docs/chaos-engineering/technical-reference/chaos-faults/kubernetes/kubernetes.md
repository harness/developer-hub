### Kubelet service kill

Kubelet service kill makes the application unreachable on the account of the node turning unschedulable (NotReady).

- Kubelet service is stopped (or killed) on a node to make it unschedulable for a specific duration defined by the `TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION` environment variable.
- The application node goes back to normal state and services are resumed after the chaos duration.

<Accordion color="green">
<summary>Use cases</summary>
This fault determines the resilience of an application when a node becomes unschedulable, i.e. NotReady state.
</Accordion>

</FaultDetailsCard>

<FaultDetailsCard category="kubernetes" subCategory="node">

### Node CPU hog

Node CPU hog exhausts the CPU resources on a Kubernetes node. The CPU chaos is injected using a helper pod running the Linux stress tool (a workload generator). The chaos affects the application for a period defined by the `TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION` environment variable.

<Accordion color="green">
<summary>Use cases</summary>
The fault aims to verify the resiliency of applications whose replicas may be evicted on account of nodes turning unschedulable (Not Ready) or new replicas not being able to schedule due to a lack of CPU resources.
The fault causes CPU stress on the target node(s). It simulates the situation of lack of CPU for processes running on the application, which degrades their performance. It also helps verify metrics-based horizontal pod autoscaling as well as vertical autoscale, i.e. demand based CPU addition. It helps scalability of nodes based on growth beyond budgeted pods. It verifies the autopilot functionality of (cloud) managed clusters. 
It benefits include verifying multi-tenant load issues (when the load increases on one container, it does not cause downtime in other containers).

Node drain drains the node of all its resources running on it. Due to this, services running on the target node should be rescheduled to run on other nodes.

<Accordion color="green">
<summary>Use cases</summary>
Node drain fault drains all the resources running on a node. This fault determines the resilience of the application when the application replicas scheduled on a node are removed. It validates the application failover capabilities when a node suddenly becomes unavailable.
It simulates node maintenance activity (hardware refresh, OS patching, Kubernetes upgrade). It verifies resource budgeting on cluster nodes (whether request (or limit) settings honored on available nodes), and whether topology constraints are adhered to (node selectors, tolerations, zone distribution, affinity(or anti-affinity) policies) or not. 
</Accordion>

</FaultDetailsCard>

<FaultDetailsCard category="kubernetes" subCategory="node">

### Node IO stress

Node IO stress causes I/O stress on the Kubernetes node. The amount of I/O stress is specifed as the size in percentage of the total free space available on the file system using `FILESYSTEM_UTILIZATION_PERCENTAGE` environment variable or in gigabytes(GB) using `FILESYSTEM_UTILIZATION_BYTES` environment variable. When both the values are provided, `FILESYSTEM_UTILIZATION_PERCENTAGE` takes precendence. It tests application resiliency on replica evictions that occur due I/O stress on the available disk space.

<Accordion color="green">
<summary>Use cases</summary>
Node network latency introduces a delay in the network communication of a Kubernetes node. The fault aims to verify the resilience of applications when faced with increased network response times. It is designed to test the behavior of applications under delayed network conditions, especially in systems where timely data transfer and communication are crucial.

It simulates the scenarios of high-latency network connections, such as cross-continental data transfers, or situations where a service is communicating with a slow or overburdened external data source. The fault tests the application's ability to maintain service quality and responsiveness in sub-optimal network conditions. It verifies how well the application handles increased response times, timeouts, and the potential for increased queue lengths or backlogs due to network delays. It can also be used to confirm the correct functioning of timeout settings and retry mechanisms in applications.

<Accordion color="green">
<summary>View fault usage</summary>
The fault degrades the network without the pod being marked as unhealthy (or unworthy) of traffic by kube-proxy (unless there is a liveness probe that measures the latency and restarts or crashes the container). This fault simulates issues within the pod network (or microservice communication) across services in different availability zones or regions.

This can be resolved by using middleware that switches traffic based on certain SLOs or performance parameters.
Another way is to set up alerts and notifications to highlight a degradation so that it can be addressed and fixed. Another way is to understand the impact of the failure and determine the last point in the application stack before degradation.

The applications may stall or get corrupted while waiting endlessly for a packet. This fault limits the impact (blast radius) to only the traffic that you wish to test by specifying the IP addresses. This fault helps to improve the resilience of your services over time.
