title: Node CPU hog
---
Node CPU hog exhausts the CPU resources on a Kubernetes node. 
- The CPU chaos is injected using a helper pod running the Linux stress tool (a workload generator). 
- The chaos affects the application for a specific duration.

## Use cases
- Node CPU hog fault helps verify the resilience of applications whose replicas get evicted on the account of the nodes turning unschedulable (in **NotReady** state) or new replicas unable to be scheduled due to a lack of CPU resources.
- It causes CPU stress on the target node(s). 
- It simulates the situation of lack of CPU for processes running on the application, which degrades their performance. 
- It also helps verify metrics-based horizontal pod autoscaling as well as vertical autoscale, that is, demand based CPU addition. 
- It helps scalability of nodes based on growth beyond budgeted pods. 
- It verifies the autopilot functionality of cloud managed clusters. 
- It also verifies multi-tenant load issues; that is, when the load increases on one container, it does not cause downtime in other containers. 

**Note**
- Kubernetes > 1.16 is required to execute this fault.
- The target nodes should be in the ready state before and after injecting chaos.

### Node CPU cores
It specifies the number of cores of CPU that will be consumed. Tune it by using the `NODE_CPU_CORE` environment variable.

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/node-cpu-hog/node-cpu-core.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# stress the CPU of the targeted nodes
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: node-cpu-hog
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # number of CPU cores to be stressed
        - name: NODE_CPU_CORE
          value: '2'
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          VALUE: '60'
```

### Node CPU load

It specifies the percentage of CPU that will be consumed. Tune it by using the `CPU_LOAD` environment variable.

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/node-cpu-hog/node-cpu-load.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# stress the CPU of the targeted nodes by load percentage
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: node-cpu-hog
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # percentage of CPU to be stressed
        - name: CPU_LOAD
          value: "100"
        # node CPU core should be provided as 0 for CPU load
        # to work otherwise it will take CPU core as priority
        - name: NODE_CPU_CORE
          value: '0'
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          VALUE: '60'
```
