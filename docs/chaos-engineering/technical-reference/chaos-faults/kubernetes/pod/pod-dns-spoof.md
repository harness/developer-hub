title: Pod DNS Spoof
---

Pod DNS spoof is a Kubernetes pod-level chaos fault that injects chaos into pods to mimic DNS resolution.
- It resolves DNS target host names (or domains) to other IPs as specified in the `SPOOF_MAP` environment variable in the chaosengine configuration.

## Usage
<details>
<summary>View fault usage</summary>
<div>
This fault determines the resilience of an application when host names are resolved incorrectly. It determines how quickly an application can resolve the host names and recover from the failure. It simulates custom responses from a spoofed upstream service.
</div>
</details>

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes> 1.16.


## Default validations

The application pods should be in running state before and after chaos injection.

## Fault examples

### Common and pod-specific tunables
Refer to the [common attributes](../../common-tunables-for-all-faults) and [pod-specific tunables](./common-tunables-for-pod-faults) to tune the common tunables for all fault and pod specific tunables.

### Spoof map

It defines the map of the target host names. For example, '{"abc.com":"spoofabc.com"}' where the key is the host name that needs to be spoofed and the value is the host name to which the key is spoofed (or redirected). You can tune it using `SPOOF_MAP` environment variable.

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]: # "./static/manifests/pod-dns-spoof/spoof-map.yaml yaml"

```yaml
# contains the spoof map for the dns spoofing
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  appinfo:
    appns: "default"
    applabel: "app=nginx"
    appkind: "deployment"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
    - name: pod-dns-spoof
      spec:
        components:
          env:
            # map of host names
            - name: SPOOF_MAP
              value: '{"abc.com":"spoofabc.com"}'
            - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
              value: "60"
```

### Container runtime and socket path

It defines the `CONTAINER_RUNTIME` and `SOCKET_PATH` environment variables to set the container runtime and socket file path, respectively.

- `CONTAINER_RUNTIME`: It supports `docker`, `containerd`, and `crio` runtimes. The default value is `containerd`.
- `SOCKET_PATH`: It contains path of containerd socket file by default(`/run/containerd/containerd.sock`). For `docker`, specify path as `/var/run/docker.sock`. For `crio`, specify path as `/var/run/crio/crio.sock`.sock`.

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]: # "./static/manifests/pod-dns-spoof/container-runtime-and-socket-path.yaml yaml"

```yaml
## provide the container runtime and socket file path
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  appinfo:
    appns: "default"
    applabel: "app=nginx"
    appkind: "deployment"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
    - name: pod-dns-spoof
      spec:
        components:
          env:
            # runtime for the container
            # supports docker
            - name: CONTAINER_RUNTIME
              value: "containerd"
            # path of the socket file
            - name: SOCKET_PATH
              value: "/run/containerd/containerd.sock"
            # map of host names
            - name: SPOOF_MAP
              value: '{"abc.com":"spoofabc.com"}'
            - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
              VALUE: "60"
```
