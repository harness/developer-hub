title: Pod CPU hog exec
---

Pod CPU hog exec is a Kubernetes pod-level chaos fault that consumes excess CPU resources of the application container.
- It simulates conditions where the application pods experience CPU spikes due to expected (or undesired) processes thereby testing the behaviour of application stack.

## Usage
<details>
<summary>View fault usage</summary>
<div>
Disk pressure or CPU hog affects Kubernetes applications which result in the eviction of the application replica and impacts its delivery. These issues are referred to as "noisy neighbour" problems.
The fault causes CPU stress on the target pod(s). It simulates the situation of lack of CPU for processes running on the application, which degrades their performance. It also helps verify metrics-based horizontal pod autoscaling as well as vertical autoscale, i.e. demand based CPU addition. It helps scalability of nodes based on growth beyond budgeted pods. It verifies the autopilot functionality of (cloud) managed clusters. 
Injecting a rogue process into a target container starves the main microservice (typically pid 1) of the resources allocated to it (where limits are defined). This slows down the application traffic or exhausts the resources leading to eviction of all pods. These faults helps build immunity to such stress cases.
It benefits include verifying multi-tenant load issues (when the load increases on one container, it does not cause downtime in other containers).

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes> 1.16.


## Default validations

The application pods should be in running state before and after chaos injection.

## Fault examples

### Common and pod-specific tunables
Refer to the [common attributes](../../common-tunables-for-all-faults) and [pod-specific tunables](./common-tunables-for-pod-faults) to tune the common tunables for all fault and pod specific tunables.

### CPU cores

It specifies the number of CPU cores to target for a duration specified by `TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION` environment variable. You can tune it using the `CPU_CORE` environment variable. 

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]: # "./static/manifests/pod-cpu-hog-exec/cpu-cores.yaml yaml"

```yaml
# CPU cores for the stress
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  appinfo:
    appns: "default"
    applabel: "app=nginx"
    appkind: "deployment"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
    - name: pod-cpu-hog-exec
      spec:
        components:
          env:
            # CPU cores for stress
            - name: CPU_CORES
              value: "1"
            - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
              value: "60"
```

### Chaos inject and kill commands

It defines the `CHAOS_INJECT_COMMAND` and `CHAOS_KILL_COMMAND` environment variables to set the chaos inject and chaos kill commands, respectively.
Default values of commands:

- `CHAOS_INJECT_COMMAND`: "md5sum /dev/zero"
- `CHAOS_KILL_COMMAND`: "kill $(find /proc -name exe -lname '\*/md5sum' 2>&1 | grep -v 'Permission denied' | awk -F/ '{print $(NF-1)}')"

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]: # "./static/manifests/pod-cpu-hog-exec/inject-and-kill-commands.yaml yaml"

```yaml
# provide the chaos kill, used to kill the chaos process
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  appinfo:
    appns: "default"
    applabel: "app=nginx"
    appkind: "deployment"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
    - name: pod-cpu-hog-exec
      spec:
        components:
          env:
            # command to create the md5sum process to stress the cpu
            - name: CHAOS_INJECT_COMMAND
              value: "md5sum /dev/zero"
            # command to kill the md5sum process
            # alternative command: "kill -9 $(ps afx | grep \"[md5sum] /dev/zero\" | awk '{print$1}' | tr '\n' ' ')"
            - name: CHAOS_KILL_COMMAND
              value: "kill $(find /proc -name exe -lname '*/md5sum' 2>&1 | grep -v 'Permission denied' | awk -F/ '{print $(NF-1)}')"
            - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
              value: "60"
```
