title: Pod network duplication
---
Pod network duplication is a Kubernetes pod-level chaos fault that injects chaos to disrupt the network connectivity to Kubernetes pods.
- It injects chaos on the specific container by starting a traffic control (tc) process with netem rules to add egress delays. 
- It determines the application's resilience to duplicate network.

## Usage
<details>
<summary>View fault usage</summary>
<div>
It determines the application's resilience to duplicate network. It simulates degraded network with varied percentages of dropped packets between microservices (dropped at the destination).

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes> 1.16.


## Default validations

The application pods should be in running state before and after chaos injection.

## Fault examples

### Common and pod-specific tunables
Refer to the [common attributes](../../common-tunables-for-all-faults) and [pod-specific tunables](./common-tunables-for-pod-faults) to tune the common tunables for all fault and pod specific tunables.

### Network packet duplication

It defines the network packet duplication percentage to be injected in the targeted application. It can be tuned via `NETWORK_PACKET_DUPLICATION_PERCENTAGE` ENV.

Use the following example to tune this:

[embedmd]: # "./static/manifests/pod-network-duplication/network-duplication.yaml yaml"

```yaml
# it injects network-duplication for the egress traffic
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  appinfo:
    appns: "default"
    applabel: "app=nginx"
    appkind: "deployment"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
    - name: pod-network-duplication
      spec:
        components:
          env:
            # network packet duplication percentage
            - name: NETWORK_PACKET_DUPLICATION_PERCENTAGE
              value: "100"
            - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
              value: "60"
```

### Destination IPs and destination hosts

The network faults interrupt traffic for all the IPs/hosts by default. The interruption of specific IPs/Hosts can be tuned via `DESTINATION_IPS` and `DESTINATION_HOSTS` ENV.

- `DESTINATION_IPS`: It contains the IP addresses of the services or pods or the CIDR blocks(range of IPs), the accessibility to which is impacted.
- `DESTINATION_HOSTS`: It contains the DNS Names/FQDN names of the services, the accessibility to which, is impacted.

Use the following example to tune this:

[embedmd]: # "./static/manifests/pod-network-duplication/destination-ips-and-hosts.yaml yaml"

```yaml
# it injects the chaos for the egress traffic for specific ips/hosts
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  appinfo:
    appns: "default"
    applabel: "app=nginx"
    appkind: "deployment"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
    - name: pod-network-duplication
      spec:
        components:
          env:
            # supports comma separated destination ips
            - name: DESTINATION_IPS
              value: "8.8.8.8,192.168.5.6"
            # supports comma separated destination hosts
            - name: DESTINATION_HOSTS
              value: "nginx.default.svc.cluster.local,google.com"
            - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
              value: "60"
```

### Network interface

The defined name of the ethernet interface, which is considered for shaping traffic. It can be tuned via `NETWORK_INTERFACE` ENV. Its default value is `eth0`.

Use the following example to tune this:

[embedmd]: # "./static/manifests/pod-network-duplication/network-interface.yaml yaml"

```yaml
# provide the network interface
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  appinfo:
    appns: "default"
    applabel: "app=nginx"
    appkind: "deployment"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
    - name: pod-network-duplication
      spec:
        components:
          env:
            # name of the network interface
            - name: NETWORK_INTERFACE
              value: "eth0"
            - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
              value: "60"
```

### Container runtime and socket path

It defines the `CONTAINER_RUNTIME` and `SOCKET_PATH` ENV to set the container runtime and socket file path.

- `CONTAINER_RUNTIME`: It supports `docker`, `containerd`, and `crio` runtimes. The default value is `containerd`.
- `SOCKET_PATH`: It contains path of containerd socket file by default(`/run/containerd/containerd.sock`). For `docker`, specify path as `/var/run/docker.sock`. For `crio`, specify path as `/var/run/crio/crio.sock`.

Use the following example to tune this:

[embedmd]: # "./static/manifests/pod-network-duplication/container-runtime-and-socket-path.yaml yaml"

```yaml
## provide the container runtime and socket file path
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  appinfo:
    appns: "default"
    applabel: "app=nginx"
    appkind: "deployment"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
    - name: pod-network-duplication
      spec:
        components:
          env:
            # runtime for the container
            # supports docker, containerd, crio
            - name: CONTAINER_RUNTIME
              value: "containerd"
            # path of the socket file
            - name: SOCKET_PATH
              value: "/run/containerd/containerd.sock"
            - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
              VALUE: "60"
```
