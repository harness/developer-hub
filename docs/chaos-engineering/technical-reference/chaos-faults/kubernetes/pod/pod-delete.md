title: Pod delete
---

Pod delete is a Kubernetes pod-level chaos fault that causes specific (or random) replicas of an application resource to fail forcibly (or gracefully).
- It simulates:
  - Graceful delete, or rescheduling, of pods as a result of upgrades; 
  - Forced deletion of pods as a result of eviction 
  - Leader-election in complex applications
- In distributed systems like Kubernetes, your application replicas may not be sufficient to manage the traffic (indicated by SLIs) when certain replicas are unavailable.
- To ensure smooth usage, applications must have a minimum number of available replicas.
- When the pressure on other replicas increases, the horizontal pod autoscaler scales based on the observed resource utilization.

## Use cases

- Pod delete can be used to check the application's deployment sanity (replica availability and uninterrupted service) and recovery workflow.
- It can be used to verify:
  - Disk (or volume) re-attachment times in stateful applications
  - Application start-up times, and readiness probe configuration (health endpoints and delays)
  - Adherence to topology constraints (node selectors, tolerations, zone distribution, and affinity (or anti-affinity) policies)
  - Proxy registration times in service-mesh environments
  - Post (lifecycle) hooks and termination seconds configuration for the microservices (under active load)- that is, graceful termination handling
  - Resource budgeting on cluster nodes (whether request or limit settings are honored on available nodes for successful schedule)


**Note**
- Kubernetes > 1.16 is required to execute this fault.
- The application pods are in the running state before and after chaos injection.

### Force delete

The target pod can be deleted `forcefully` or `gracefully`. Tune it by using the `FORCE` environment variable. It will delete the pod forcefully if `FORCE` is set to `true` and gracefully if `FORCE` is set to `false`.

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]: # "./static/manifests/pod-delete/force.yaml yaml"

```yaml
# tune the deletion of target pods forcefully or gracefully
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  appinfo:
    appns: "default"
    applabel: "app=nginx"
    appkind: "deployment"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
    - name: pod-delete
      spec:
        components:
          env:
            # provided as true for the force deletion of pod
            # supports true and false value
            - name: FORCE
              value: "true"
            - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
              value: "60"
```

### Random interval

The randomness in the chaos interval can be enabled by setting `RANDOMNESS` environment variable to `true`. It supports boolean values. The default value is `false`.
Tune it by using the `CHAOS_INTERVAL` environment variable.

- If `CHAOS_INTERVAL` is set in the form of `l-r` that is, `5-10` then it will select a random interval between l and r.
- If `CHAOS_INTERVAL` is set in the form of `value` that is, `10` then it will select a random interval between 0 and value.

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]: # "./static/manifests/pod-delete/randomness-interval.yaml yaml"

```yaml
# contains random chaos interval with lower and upper bound of range i.e [l,r]
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  appinfo:
    appns: "default"
    applabel: "app=nginx"
    appkind: "deployment"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
    - name: pod-delete
      spec:
        components:
          env:
            # randomness enables iterations at random time interval
            # it supports true and false value
            - name: RANDOMNESS
              value: "true"
            - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
              value: "60"
            # it will select a random interval within this range
            # if only one value is provided then it will select a random interval within 0-CHAOS_INTERVAL range
            - name: CHAOS_INTERVAL
              value: "5-10"
```
