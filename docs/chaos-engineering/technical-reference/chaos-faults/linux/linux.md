<!-- Heading Description -->

## Introduction

Linux faults disrupt the resources running on a Linux machine. This deteriorates the performance of the application for the duration of the chaos experiment.

## Resource consumption

The infrastructure consumes minimal system resources in an idle state, when no experiment is being executed. For example, in a GCP e2-micro VM instance with **2 vCPU** and **1 GB** of memory that runs **Ubuntu 22.04** operating system, the average resource consumption was found to be as follows:

- **CPU usage:** 0.05%
- **Memory usage:** 1.5%
- **Disk storage consumption:** 25 MB
- **Bandwidth consumption:** 0.15 KB/s

## Fault compatibility matrix

The faults have been tested for compatibility in the following Linux OS distributions:

|                                                 | Stress faults (cpu, memory, disk IO) | Network faults (loss, latency, corruption, duplication) | DNS faults (error, spoof) | Process faults (process kill, service restart) | Time chaos | Disk fill |
