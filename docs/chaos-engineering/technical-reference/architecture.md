This section describes the Harness Chaos Engineering (HCE) architecture along with the components.

Below is an overview of the HCE architecture.

![Overview](./static/architecture/overview.png)

HCE comprises two parts:

1. **Harness control plane**
2. **Chaos infrastructure**

The diagram below gives a peek into the HCE architecture.

## Harness control plane

**Harness control plane** is the single source to collaboratively create, schedule, and monitor chaos experiments. It comes with a set of chaos faults that are defined in a sequence, which helps achieve the desired chaos impact on the target resources. You can sign in to the Harness platform and leverage the interactive UI dashboard to enable chaos in your infrastructure, define your chaos experiments and target the infrastructure. You can also monitor the experiments during their execution.

### Control plane components

The control plane in HCE contains many components, which are described below.

#### Chaos infrastructure

**Chaos infrastructure** is a service that runs within your target environment to help HCE access the target resources and inject chaos at cloud-native scale. It can be set up with cluster-wide access or with a single namespace scope.

- There are different types of chaos infrastructures for different environments, such as Kubernetes, Linux VMs, AWS cloud, VMware, etc.
- Based on the target environments, chaos infrastructures can be installed as a Kubernetes service, a Linux daemon, and so on.

All the chaos infrastructure services adhere to the principle of least privilege, where the services execute with the minimum number of permissions. You can add multiple chaos infrastructures to a single environment and subject it to a chaos experiment as an entity.

#### Enterprise hub

Enterprise chaos hub comes out of the box with HCE and provides many faults and experiment templates. Enterprise hub is a prebuilt chaos hub, a collection of manifests and charts that represent the existing experiments and faults. You can use faults from multiple categories to create chaos experiments in the Enterprise chaos hub.

#### Chaos manager

Chaos manager is a GraphQL-based Golang microservice that serves the requests received from the chaos infrastructure either by querying the database for relevant information or fetching information from the execution plane.

#### Database

This is a NoSQL MongoDB database microservice accountable for storing users' information, past chaos experiments, saved chaos experiment templates, user projects, chaos hubs, and GitOps details, among other information.

## Harness execution plane

**Harness Execution Plane** contains the components responsible for orchestrating the chaos injection into the target resources. These components are installed through the chaos infrastructure. The Kubernetes execution plane consists of chaos delegate infrastructure components like workflow controllers, subscribers, event trackers, etc., and backend execution infrastructure components like ChaosExperiment CR, ChaosEngine CR, etc.

## Chaos infrastructure

Chaos infrastructure components help facilitate the chaos injection, and enable chaos automation for target resources. Some of the important components of chaos infrastructure are listed below.

- **Workflow controller**: The Argo Workflow Controller responsible for the creation of the chaos experiment.

- **Subscriber**: Serves as the link between the **chaos execution plane** and the **control plane**. Its responsibilities include performing a health check on all the components in the chaos execution plane, creating a chaos experiment CR from a chaos experiment template, watching for chaos experiment events during its execution, and sending the chaos experiment result to the control plane.

- **Event tracker**: An optional component capable of triggering an automated chaos experiment based on a set of conditions defined for any given resource in the cluster. It manages EventTrackerPolicy CR, which is a set of conditions validated by the event tracker. If the current state of the tracked resources matches the state defined in the EventTrackerPolicy CR, the chaos experiment is triggered. This feature can only be used if GitOps is enabled.

- **Chaos exporter**: An optional component that facilitates external observability in HCE. This is achieved by exporting the chaos metrics generated during the chaos injection as time-series data to the Prometheus database for processing and analysis.
