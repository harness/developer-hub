You can add a condition that specifies when an event should be marked as critical. When an event occurs and matches the condition that you set, it will be labeled as **CRITICAL** in the Events page.


## Add a condition

To add a condition:

1. In your Harness project, navigate to **Continuous Error Tracking**, expand **PROJECT SETUP**, and then select either **Tokens** or **Agents**.

2. In the top right corner of the Project Code Error Settings page, select **Critical Events**.
   
3. On the Critical Event Settings page, **+ Add Condition**.

4. Select an **event type**, **entry point**, and optional **location**.  
   
   You can choose multiple events. If you select caught exception, uncaught exception, or swallowed exception as event type, then you must also select an **exception type**.

5. Select the check mark (✔️) to save the condition. The condition is added to the conditions list on the Critical Event Settings page.
