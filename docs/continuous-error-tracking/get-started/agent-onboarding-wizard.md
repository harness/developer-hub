The CET Agent Onboarding Wizard helps you quickly install and configure the CET Agent in your environment. The wizard:

* Provides instructions for downloading the necessary Agent installation files.
* Dynamically generates variable settings based on your environment details, which you can copy and apply during the Agent installation process.

This topic provides instructions on how to use the CET Agent Onboarding Wizard.


## Generate Agent configuration

To generate Agent configuration settings, do the following:

1. In your Harness project, navigate to the **Continuous Error Tracking** module, and then select **Monitored Services**.
   
   The Monitored Services page appears, displaying a list of all the monitored services in your project. It also displays whether Agent and notifications are configured for each monitored service.

2. Select **Configure Error Tracking Agent** to start creating a configuration. You can also select a monitored service, go to the **Agent Configurations** tab, and then select **New error tracking agent configuration** to launch the agent wizard.
   
   The Configure error tracking agent for monitored service wizard appears.

3. Enter a name for the configuration and select **Next**.

4. Select a token from the dropdown and select **Next**.

5. Optionally, provide source repository details if you want to access a code repository, branch, and commits related to errors from the ARC screen.

6.  Select your application programming language, version, and OS. Based on the OS that you select, you might need to enter OS distribution details.
   
   Once you have entered your programming language and OS information, CET displays the Agent configuration information and usage instructions.
