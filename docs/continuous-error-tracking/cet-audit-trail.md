# CET Audit trail

Your Harness account [Audit Trail](/docs/platform/governance/audit-trail/audit-trail.md) includes events for CET changes.

## CET events in the Audit Trail

To access the Audit Trail, in your Harness project, navigate to **Account Settings** > **Audit Trail**.

The Account Audit Trail page is displayed.

The Account Audit Trail includes the following CET events:

- User activity such as login
- Creation, revocation, or deletion of CET Agent Tokens
- Edits, updates, or deletions of critical events

Each event in the Account Audit Trail list provides the following details:

- Action: Describes the specific activity, such as logging in or deleting.
- Resource name and type: Identifies the resource type and its name where the event occurred. For example, monitored service, agent, or user.
- Organization and project: Name of the organization and the project in which the event occurred.

When you click on a resource name, you will be directed to the corresponding event page. For instance, clicking on an **Agent Token** resource will take you to the Agent Token listing page, while clicking on a **Monitored Service** resource will redirect you to the monitored services listing page.
