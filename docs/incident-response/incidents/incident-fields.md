# Configure Incident Fields

Learn how to configure and customize fields for incidents in Harness IR.

## Overview

Incident fields help you:
- Capture essential incident data
- Standardize incident reporting
- Enable effective filtering
- Support automation
- Generate insights

## Field Types

### Required Fields

#### Basic Information
```yaml
field_definitions:
  title:
    type: string
    required: true
    template: "[service] - [issue_type]"
  severity:
    type: enum
    values: [P1, P2, P3, P4, P5]
    required: true
  status:
    type: enum
    values: [detected, investigating, mitigating, resolved]
    required: true
```

#### Service Context
```yaml
field_definitions:
  service:
    type: string
    required: true
    source: service_catalog
  environment:
    type: enum
    values: [production, staging, development]
    required: true
  team:
    type: string
    required: true
    source: team_directory
```

### Optional Fields

#### Impact Assessment
```yaml
field_definitions:
  affected_users:
    type: number
    description: "Number of affected users"
  error_rate:
    type: float
    unit: "percentage"
  regions:
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
      source: region_list
```

#### Timeline Data
```yaml
field_definitions:
  detected_at:
    type: timestamp
    format: "ISO8601"
  resolved_at:
    type: timestamp
    format: "ISO8601"
  duration:
    type: duration
    computed: true
    formula: "resolved_at - detected_at"
```

## Field Configuration

### Custom Fields
```yaml
custom_fields:
  customer_impact:
    type: enum
    values: [none, low, medium, high, critical]
    description: "Impact level on customers"
  root_cause:
    type: string
    multiline: true
    description: "Root cause analysis"
  follow_up:
    type: array
    items:
      type: object
      properties:
        action: string
        owner: string
        due_date: timestamp
```

### Field Dependencies
```yaml
dependencies:
  - if:
      severity: P1
    then:
      required: [customer_impact, root_cause]
  - if:
      status: resolved
    then:
      required: [resolution_summary, follow_up]
```

### Field Validation
```yaml
validation:
  title:
    pattern: "[A-Za-z0-9\\s\\-]+"
    min_length: 10
    max_length: 100
  description:
    min_length: 50
    max_length: 1000
  affected_users:
    min: 0
    max: 1000000
```

## Field Templates

### Service Incident
```yaml
template:
  name: "Service Incident"
  fields:
    title: "[service] - Service Degradation"
    severity: [severity]
    service: [service]
    environment: [environment]
    team: [team]
    description: "Service degradation detected in [service]"
```

### Security Incident
```yaml
template:

  fields:
    title: "[service] - Security Alert"
    severity: P1
    service: [service]

update_status:
  status: investigating
  fields:
    assignee: [user]
    notes: "Investigation started by [user]"
```

### Resolution
```yaml
resolve_incident:
  status: resolved
  fields:
    resolution_summary: [summary]
    root_cause: [root_cause]
    follow_up:
      - action: "Update runbook"
        owner: [team]
        due_date: [timestamp]
```
