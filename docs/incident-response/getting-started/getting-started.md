Harness Incident Response (IR) is a cutting-edge module that revolutionizes incident management by focusing on proactive issue prevention and accelerated resolution. A key differentiator is its ability to correlate change events from disparate sources, such as CI/CD pipelines, Feature Flags, third party changes, and deployments, providing unparalleled context for incident attribution. Harness IR automates prioritization and response orchestration while integrating seamlessly with existing tools like ServiceNow, Slack, and monitoring systems. 

IR provides real-time visibility into service health, error budgets, and associated changes empower teams to resolve incidents faster, minimize downtime, and drive operational excellence.
