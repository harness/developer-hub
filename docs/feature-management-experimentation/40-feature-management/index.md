[Define feature flags](docs/feature-management-experimentation/40-feature-management/docs/quickstart-create-a-feature-flag.md) in Harness, then evaluate feature flags in real time from your codebase.

<div style={{display: 'flex', width:'100%', boxSizing: 'border-box'}}>

Flexible targeting rules allow you to roll out beta features to a defined segment of users, canary-release to a sample percentage, or make adjustments to live code in the wild using [dynamic configurations](docs/feature-management-experimentation/40-feature-management/docs/feature-flags/treatments/dynamic-configurations.md).
