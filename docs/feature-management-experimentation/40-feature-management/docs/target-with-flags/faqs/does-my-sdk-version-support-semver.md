## Question

I noticed an info banner when adding a Split feature flag targeting rule that uses the **SemVer** (Semantic Version) matcher. How can I confirm that the Split SDK version that I am using in my code base will support the [SemVer matcher](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360020793231-Target-with-custom-attributes#semver-attributes)?
