The data export functionality within the Data hub gives development teams the ability to query and export all impression and event data. With data export, development teams can:

* Create new data exports and add query criteria to refine your exports
* View previously generated data exports

## Create data export 

You can export both impression or event data by following below steps: 

1. From the navigation bar, click **Data hub** and select the **Data export** tab.
2. Click the **Create** button for the data type you want to export.
3. Select a time range to query across.
4. Optionally click **Add query criteria** to filter the data you are exporting across a variety of dimensions.
5. Click the **Create** button.

Impressions and events are available for the last 90 days. The data export result is empty if the feature flag version is not within the selected time range.

**Note: Depending on the query criteria and the number of events or impressions, exports can take up to 5 minutes to generate.**

## Accessing data exports 

Once you create your data export, you can access your generated exports to download via a CSV. In this table, you can delete any generated exports.   

## Data export limits 

The following limits apply to data exports:

* 5 data export requests per account per day, which can be increased 
* 10,000,000 records per impression data export
* 1,000,000 records per event data export
* 7 day data export retention window. Reports are available for 7 days before they are deleted and no longer accessible

Contact [support@split.io](emailto:support@split.io) if you have any questions or concerns regarding your data export limits.
