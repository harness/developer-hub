**Note: Get access to alert policies by contacting your customer success manager or[support](mailto:support@split.io) and we’ll enable in your account.**

The alert baseline treatment is always one of the treatments defined for any feature flag in the targeting rules. The alert baseline treatment can only be a treatment that meets the following criteria;

* it is within a specific targeting rule that you want to be alerted on.
* it is incorporated into a percentage allocation of a targeting rule.
* the percentage allocation to this treatment is more than 0%.

Note that **alert not possible if selected** is beside the treatment that does not meet the criteria above.
