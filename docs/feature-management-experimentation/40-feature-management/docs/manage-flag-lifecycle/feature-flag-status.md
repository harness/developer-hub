You can assign a status to each feature flag when creating or updating targeting rules. Statuses provide a way for teams to indicate which stage of a release or rollout a feature is in at any given moment, and as a way for teammates to filter their feature flags to see only features in a particular stage of the internal release process.

**Note:** For more information about the rollout board, refer to the [Use the Rollout board](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/4405016480269) guide.

## Change the status of a feature flag

When you review the Change summary page for saving or submitting a change for a feature flag definition, you can change a particular status of your flag. To change a status, do the following:

1. After submitting a change to the rollout plan of a feature flag, on the Change summary page, in the Status field, select the desired status, e.g. Internal testing. 

   **Note: If you create a new feature flag, the default is Pre-production. For any existing flag, it keeps its existing status.**

</p>

2. To decide when  this change takes effect selection, you can either select:


  * Immediately: The change takes effect once you save change
   * At a later time: The change takes effect on a specified date and time

3. After you make a selection, click the **Save** button to save your changes.

If you want to change the status of that feature flag without changing the rollout plan, you can mark a flag as permanent or removed from the code, or to assign a status if you forgot to do so when you changed your targeting rules. To change the status, do the following:

1. Select the feature flag you want to assign a new status to.

2. In the Details are, click the gear icon and select **Edit details**. The Details panel appears.

  </p>   

3. Select the desired status. A change status message appears asking if you want to change the status. 

4. Click the **Save** button to save your changes.

## Display and filter your statuses

Once you assign statuses to your feature flags, you can then display and filter them to view the ones within the browse area that are relevant to you. To display and filter your flags, do the following:

1. From the left hand navigation bar, click **Feature flags**. A list of feature flags and their associated status badges display.

2. From the feature flag list view, select **Filter** and then **Status**. The list of filters displays.
