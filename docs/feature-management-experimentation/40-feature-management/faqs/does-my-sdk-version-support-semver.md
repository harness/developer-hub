### Question

In Harness FME, I noticed an info banner when adding a feature flag targeting rule that uses the **SemVer** (Semantic Version) matcher. How can I confirm that the Harness FME SDK version that I am using in my codebase will support the [SemVer matcher](/docs/feature-management-experimentation/feature-management/target-with-custom-attributes#semver-attributes)?
