### Question

Is there a way to delete a segment with all its keys in one action, rather than deleting each key individually?

### Answer

It is possible to delete all keys from the segment user interface:

1. Locate the down arrow on top of the checkboxes column.
2. Click on it to display two menu items.
3. Select all records from there, then Delete button appears.
