### Issue

When [submitting a change request](https://docs.split.io/reference#create-change-request) while using the Admin API to specify the approver contact, the request fails with 400 error.

```json
{"code":400,"message":"Something was wrong","details":"","transactionId":"xxxxxxx"}
```

### Root cause

This error is possible if the approver option is set in the environment that has the feature flag. When approvers are pre-selected, it is not allowed to specify an approver when submitting the change request, similarly to when submitting the change from the Split user interface; the approver edit box will be greyed out.

### Answer

Verify if the feature flag definitions belong to an environment that has approvers set in its permissions. If so, remove the approver contact and leave the approvers array empty in the JSON payload.

```json
"approvers":[]
```
