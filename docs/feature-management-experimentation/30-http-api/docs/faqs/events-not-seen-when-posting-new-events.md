### Issue

When using Admin API to [post events](https://docs.split.io/reference/events-overview), the call response code is 202, but the event does not show up in Split Data hub.

### Root cause

This issue can occur if the Epoch timestamp used is invalid, empty, or in seconds, instead of milliseconds. 

### Answer

Verify the following data in the call is correct:

1. Epoch timestamp used is in millisecond.
2. Traffic type used exists in Split organization.
3. The API key used is the SDK API Key and not Admin API Key.
