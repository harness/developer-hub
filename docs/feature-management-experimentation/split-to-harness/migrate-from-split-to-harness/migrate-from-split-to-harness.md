## Overview

In September 2024, the Split leadership team, now leading Harness's Feature Management & Experimentation business unit, shared a plan to integrate Split with the Harness Platform.

The integration will fulfill key promises:

* **Minimal Effort**: Little to no work required from your team.
* **No Downtime**: Your production applications remain uninterrupted.
* **Immediate Benefits**: New features available from day one.

## Three-Point Summary

1. **Front-End URL Changes, User Flows Remain**

   - On your migration day, Split’s front-end interface will move from `app.split.io` to `app.harness.io`.
   - No Retraining for Users: User tasks stay the same.
   - Changes for Admins: Guides will assist with the transition.

1. **Back-End Stays the Same: No Developer Updates Needed**

   - Split’s back-end infrastructure remains unchanged.
   - No Code Changes Related to SDKs Required: Your developers won’t need to modify any application code interacting with Split SDKs, feature flags, or events.
   - Optional Infrastructure Unchanged: No updates for Split Proxy, Split Synchronizer, or Split Evaluator.
   - Back-end integrations (i.e. S3, Segment, mParticle, etc.) will be served from the same back-end after the new Harness front-end is activated for your account. They will not need reconfiguring.

1. **Harness Handles Migration Steps, with Two Exceptions**

   - SSO Configuration: You need to set up a new SSO connection to Harness (if you use SSO).
   - Admin API Script Updates: Update automation scripts for any of the 5 affected endpoints.

## Next Steps for Users

   - Know Your Migration Window: Your administrator will know which week your migration will take place in. Watch for in-app banner updates as well.
   - Watch the [Video Preview](https://youtu.be/Mx4nux9hd2A): Preview the similar user experience, with new read-only settings screens for non-admins.

## Next Steps for Administrators

   - Watch [30 Seconds to Confidence: How Your Migration Will Work](/docs/feature-management-experimentation/split-to-harness/how-it-works/) (to see why there will be no downtime for your applications).
   - Identify which of the three scenarios below apply to you (and plan to take action if needed).
   - Keep an eye out for migration date updates by email and in-app banner notifications.

### Scenario One: Do You Use Management Screens?

   - Task: Learn to use new screens for managing users, groups, projects, permissions, or API keys.
   - Resource: Access the [RBAC for Split Admins](/docs/feature-management-experimentation/split-to-harness/administering-migrated-account/) migration guide.

     - Compare Split and Harness admin screens side-by-side.
     - Watch short interactive and written step-by-step guides designed to quickly get you up to speed with tasks such as adding users, creating and editing groups, etc.
   
   - Future Update: Environment-level Permissions will move out of FME Settings and into Harness RBAC management. We will update the Before and After Guides at that time.

### Scenario Two: Do You Access Split via SSO?

   - Task: create a new SSO Connection at least one week before migration.
   - Resource: Access the [SSO for Split Admins](/docs/feature-management-experimentation/split-to-harness/sso-for-admins) migration guide.
   - By April 4th, 2025: Harness account invites were sent to all Split Administrators

     - Task Detail: Accept your invite by resetting your password.
     - Task Detail: Coordinate with your IT team to configure SSO.

### Scenario Three: Has Your Organization Automated Tasks With the Split Admin API?

   - Task: Update scripts if using one of the 5 impacted Split Admin API endpoints.
   - Resource: Access the [API for Split Admins](/docs/feature-management-experimentation/split-to-harness/api-for-split-admins) migration guide. This guide includes ready-to-run API examples in Postman.
   - Usage Data: To learn if your organization has recently used any of the 5 impacted endpoints, look for the emails below and read [Admin API Updates](/docs/feature-management-experimentation/split-to-harness/api-updates). 

     - February 21st, 2025: "Follow-Up: Changes to Split Admin API Endpoints & Migration to Harness."
     - February 27th, 2025: "Updated 2/27/25: Follow-Up: Changes to Split Admin API Endpoints & Migration to Harness."
