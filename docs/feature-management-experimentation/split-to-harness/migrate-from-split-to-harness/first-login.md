## After migration

When your account is migrated to Feature Management & Experimentation (FME), your [feature flags](/docs/feature-management-experimentation/getting-started/key-concepts#what-is-a-feature-flag) and [projects](/docs/platform/organizations-and-projects/projects-and-organizations/#what-is-a-project) are automatically moved into a new [organization](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/organizations-and-projects/projects-and-organizations/) named `<YOUR_ORG_NAME> FME`. When logging in or selecting a project, make sure you are in this organization.

:::info
If you aren't seeing your expected feature flags or projects, first confirm you are in your `<YOUR_ORG_NAME> FME` organization, and then verify you selected the migrated project.
