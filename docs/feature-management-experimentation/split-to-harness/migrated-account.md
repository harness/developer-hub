## Overview

If you see the following message when attempting to log in to Split, your account has been migrated to `app.harness.io`, and you need to access it from there going forward:

<img src={require('./static/account-migrated.png').default} alt="Account Migrated to Harness" width="500" />

The migration has been designed to be as straightforward for you as possible. Day-to-day tasks for non-admin users are the same on `app.harness.io` as they were on Split. Admins have a few changes, but they also get some very handy new powers.

## Next Steps

### If you usually log in with user/password

1. Go to `app.harness.io`.
1. Attempt to log in with your Split login and a random password.
1. After the login fails, click **Forgot password?**.
1. Enter your Split login email and click **Reset password**.
1. Find the email in your inbox with the subject, “Reset your Harness Platform password”.
1. Click the **Reset Password** button in the email and set your password in the page that appears.
1. Log in to `app.harness.io` with your new password.

### If you usually log in with a single sign-on (SSO) tile

If you usually start from a tile on Okta, Entra ID, or another IDP portal, then look for a new tile named "Harness" or similar and click that.

### If you usually log in with single sign-on (SSO) from the Split login screen

If you usually go to `app.split.io` and then log in via SSO, you can now do the same on `app.harness.io`.
