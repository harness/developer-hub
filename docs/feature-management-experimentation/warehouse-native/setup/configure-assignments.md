## Overview

When creating or editing an Assignment Source, navigate to your project's settings: **Admin Settings** > **Project Settings** > **View Project** (for non-migrated orgs) or **FME Settings** > **Project Settings** > **View Project** (for migrated orgs). From there, you can define the assignment source table using either a **Table name** or a **SQL query**. 

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="table" label="Table Name">

### Select a table

:::info
Recommended if your data is already modeled into a clean impression/exposure table.
:::

1. Select an existing table name directly from the schema.
1. Click **Test connection** to validate that Harness can query the table successfully before continuing.

With Assignment Sources configured, you can confidently create experiments, knowing all exposures are correctly captured, standardized, and reusable across analyses.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="query" label="SQL Query">

### Use a custom SQL query

:::info
Recommended for light data transformations (e.g., extracting values from JSON), joins across multiple tables, or scoping to a subset of data.
:::

You must have permissions to access all tables referenced in your query, based on the role and credentials configured when setting up your warehouse connection.

1. Write a SQL query that outputs the required fields.
1. After entering your query, click **Run query** to validate and preview results before proceeding.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Harness FME will preview the query output so you can confirm the correct fields are returned.

## Add field mappings

Define the following fields from your assignment source to Harness FME:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| Unique Identifier | Maps to the column representing the unique key for user, account, or entity. |
| Impression Timestamp | Maps to the column representing when the user was assigned to a treatment. |
| Treatment | Maps to the column that stores the treatment or experiment variant (e.g., `control`, `variant_a`). |

### Configure your environments

<Tabs groupId="mapping-values">
<TabItem value="column" label="Column Mapping">

Select an environment column and map its values to Harness FME environments. For example, select the `ENV_NAME` column and map its values (`US-Prod`, `UK-Prod`) to your Harness project’s `Production` environment and map the `Stg` values (`US-Stg`, `UK-Stg`) to your Harness project’s `Staging` environment.

This allows a single Assignment Source to span multiple environments.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="value" label="Hardcoded Value">

Instead of selecting a column, set a fixed Harness FME environment for the entire Assignment Source (e.g., always `Production`).

This is recommended if the entire source table is scoped to one environment.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Configure your traffic types

Similar to environments, traffic types can be set up in two ways:

<Tabs groupId="mapping-values">
<TabItem value="column" label="Column Mapping">

Select a traffic type column (e.g., `ttid`) and map its values to Harness FME traffic types (e.g., `user`, `account`, or `anonymous`).

This is recommended if the same Assignment Source covers multiple population types.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="value" label="Hardcoded Value">

Instead of selecting a column, set a fixed Harness FME traffic type for the entire Assignment Source (e.g., always `account`).

This is recommended if the entire source table is scoped to one population type.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Additional configuration options

* **Preview data**: Harness shows a preview of the data returned from your table or query so you can validate that the expected rows and columns are present.
* **Owners**: Assign one or more owners to make clear who is responsible for maintaining the Assignment Source.
* **Tags**: Add tags (e.g., by team, environment, or use case) to make sources easier to discover and organize.

## Manage assignment sources

Assignment Sources can be reusable and standardized, or tailored to individual experiments depending on your organization’s needs:

* Reusable, standardized sources are recommended if you have a general impressions/exposures table.

  This approach makes setup faster and consistent across teams. Be mindful of potential query processing speed and warehouse costs when working with very large shared tables.

* Custom per-experiment sources are recommended if you want to scope data more tightly for privacy, relevancy, or performance.

  Limits experiment creators to a specific subset of data, reducing query volume and potential data access concerns.

Ultimately, it’s up to your organization whether to centralize around a single reusable source or create smaller, experiment-specific sources. Many teams use a mix of both strategies depending on scale and governance needs.

Once you've set up the assignment sources that best fit your workflow, you can manage them directly in Harness FME. 

* **Edit**: You can update the table reference, query, or mappings as your data model evolves. Changes to an existing Assignment Source may disrupt any experiments that are actively using it.
* **Delete**: Remove outdated or misconfigured sources to reduce clutter and prevent accidental use.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues when configuring an Assignment Source:

<details>
<summary>Test Connection or Run Query Fails</summary>

1. Ensure your table or SQL query is valid and accessible with the credentials tied to your warehouse connection.

1. Check that you have permission to query all referenced schemas/tables.

1. Verify that the schema and table names are spelled correctly.
</details>

<details>
<summary>No Data Appears in Preview</summary>

If you are using a SQL query, try running it directly in your warehouse to confirm output.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Column Not Detected or Missing</summary>

Verify that your source table/query outputs the required columns: unique identifier, timestamp, and treatment.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Incorrect Environment or Traffic Type Mapping</summary>

1. Double-check that each warehouse value (e.g., `UK-Prod`) is mapped to the correct Harness environment (e.g., `Production`).
1. If everything should map to one environment or type, consider using the hardcoded value option instead of column mapping.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Assignment Source Not Showing in Experiment Setup</summary>

1. Make sure you clicked **Save** after configuration.
1. Confirm that the source hasn’t been deleted, disabled, or restricted to owners only.
