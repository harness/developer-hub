## Overview 

Understanding how your experiment is performing, and whether it's driving meaningful impact, is key to making confident, data-informed product decisions. Warehouse Native experiment results help you interpret metrics derived directly from your <Tooltip id="fme.warehouse-native.data-warehouse">data warehouse</Tooltip>, assess experiment health, and share validated outcomes with stakeholders.
