The Metrics impact tab shows the impact of your experiment or feature rollout on your customers. To make data-driven decisions on your features, review and interpret the data that you collect before deciding to roll out the functionality to more customers. The data on this tab allows you to ensure safe and reliable feature delivery while powering data-driven decisions. Before getting started, review the following:

* Understand how your most important metrics (overall evaluation criteria) were both positively and negatively impacted to learn more about what your customers expect and how you should change your feature functionality.
* Compare the actual impact with your team's preliminary hypothesis.
* Ensure that you understand the impact and tradeoffs on your account's guardrail and performance metrics.
* Share the impact with your team.

## Viewing metrics 

To view the impact of your feature rollout on your account's metrics, from your selected feature flag, click the **Metrics impact** tab. The metric cards show how your account's metrics change when comparing treatments against your flag's baseline treatment.

The Metrics impact tab is described as follows:

* **View impact for.** Select the version or a custom date, targeting rule, and treatments that you want to compare. When you select the treatment, you can see the number of unique keys in that treatment. For more information, refer to the [Apply filters guide](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360020848451-Applying-filters).
* **Summary of metrics impact.** View how long your measurements have been running, and the last update time for the metrics displayed below. You can also force a recalculation of your metrics by clicking the Recalculate metrics button. This recalculation usually takes around 5 minutes but is dependent on the length of your experiment and the size of your data.
* **Filter metrics.** Filter down to metrics with a positive or negative impact by clicking the tile. You can deselect and view all by clicking the tile again.
* **Key metrics.** Select the key metrics that you want to monitor to help you evaluate the success of this feature. Learn about [Configuring feature flag alerting](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/19832711328397-Configuring-feature-flag-alerting) for your key metrics. Key metrics are recalculated on a schedule, or when you click the *Recalculate* button.
* **Guardrail metrics.** Globally protected guardrail metrics adhere to an account-wide alerting policy. See the [Metric definition](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/22005565241101-Metrics#metric-categories) page for more information. Guardrail metrics are recalculated on a schedule, or when you click the *Recalculate* button.
* **Supporting metrics.** Select the supporting metrics that you want to monitor for this experiment or feature rollout. These metrics should be important to you, but may not be your primary success metrics for this feature. Supporting metrics are recalculated on a schedule, or when you click the *Recalculate* button.

To learn more about analyzing and filtering data on the Metrics Impact tab, see [Applying filters](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360020848451).

## Automated calculation frequency

Automatic calculations are run for feature flag versions that include a percentage targeting rule. The duration between automatic calculations scales with the length of the version since the longer the experiment has run, the less likely that the data collected in the last few hours can move the metric. You can see the last calculation time on the Metrics impact tab.

The automated calculation schedule is:

* After 5 minutes, then
* After 30 minutes, then
* After 1 hour, then
* Every 1 hour until 12 hours, then
* Every 2 hours until 24 hours, then
* Every 1 day until 7 days, then
* On day 14, then
* On day 21, then
* On day 28

## Manually recalculating metrics

You can manually run calculations on-demand by clicking the Recalculate button. Recalculations can be run for key metrics only, or for all metrics (key, guardrail, and supporting). **Most recalculations take up to five minutes, but can take longer, depending on the size of your data and the length of your experiment.**

Reasons you may choose to recalculate metrics:
* If you create or modify a metric after the last updated metric impact calculation, recalculate to get the latest results.
* If you assign a metric to the Key metrics or Supporting metrics groups, recalculate to populate results for those metrics.
* If the current version of this feature flag was created more than 28 days ago, recalculate to update results with the most recent data. Note that FMEâ€™s data retention period is 90 days. The influence of data points prior to 90 days are lost, even if the feature flag version is older than 90 days.

The Recalculate button will be disabled when:

* **No impressions for this version are received within the current retention period (i.e., the last 90 days).** To enable the recalculation, check that the SDK is correctly initialized in your code and verify that the metric event was sent.
* **A forced recalculation is already scheduled.** A calculation is in progress.  You can click the Recalculate button again, as soon as the currently running calculation finishes.
