Understanding how your experiment is performing, and whether it's driving meaningful impact, is critical to making confident product decisions. Experiment results help you interpret metrics, assess experiment health, reallocate traffic, and share findings with stakeholders.

## View experiment results

Review your experiment's metrics and overall status. Explore metric-level details, explore trends, and learn how your results are calculated.

For more information, see [Viewing experiment results](./viewing-experiment-results).

## Analyze experiment results

Drill down into experiment details to validate setup, explore user behavior, and identify potential issues.

For more information, see [Analyzing experiment results](./analyzing-experiment-results).

## Reallocate traffic

Once you've analyzed your results, you can adjust your rollout strategy by shifting users between treatments or rolling out to 100% of your users. 

For more information, see [Reallocating traffic](./reallocate-traffic).

## Share results
 
 You can download key metrics, trends, and impact summaries in CSV or JSON format for offline analysis or sharing with teammates.
