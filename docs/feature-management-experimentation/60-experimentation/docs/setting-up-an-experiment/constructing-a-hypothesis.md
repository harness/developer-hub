<p>
  A key step in developing and designing an experiment is constructing a hypothesis.
  To help you structure your hypothesis in a meaningful way, we've provided a framework
  below with two helpful templates -- a simple one, and an advanced one.
</p>
<p></p>
<h2 id="h_01HB99WRTKBB29FHH1NRES4FD1">Hypothesis Framework</h2>
<p>
  <strong>Step 1: </strong>Define the <strong>problem:</strong>What
  is the rationale for experimenting? What do you want to learn? What data do you
  have to inform your design? <em><strong>(Problem)</strong></em>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Step 2:</strong> Define the <strong>solution:</strong> What are ways in which you can change the experiences? What strategy will dictate the tactic for the experiment? <em><strong>(Strategy and Tactic)</strong></em>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Step 3: </strong>Define the measures for <strong>success:</strong> What proves this hypothesis to be true? What is the expected outcome? <strong><em>(Result)</em></strong>
</p>

<h2 id="h_01HB99RS867ARSE3JX2563GNY0">Simple Hypothesis Template</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Because we observed
    <em>motivating</em><em> data or feedback</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    We expect that <em>change</em>
    will cause
    <em>expected metric impact</em>
  </li>
</ol>
<h2 id="h_01HB99RS86F7B41NKDC8P1BAC5">Advanced Hypothesis Template</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>(TACTIC) </strong>By introducing <em>X change</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>(STRATEGY)</strong> We can <em>remove/create/reduce X</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>(RESULT)</strong> And <em>increase/decrease X metric</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>(TACTIC) </strong>By/with <em>X solution and tactic</em>
  </li>
</ol>
