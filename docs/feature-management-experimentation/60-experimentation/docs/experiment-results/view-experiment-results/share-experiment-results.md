## Sharing your results

Sharing results allows you to download a copy of your metrics impact results in various formats or share via URL. You can:

* Share the outcome of your experiments with colleagues without them needing to visit Split
* Keep a record of experiment outcomes in your preferred documentation formats or applications
* Conduct further manual analysis or visualizations as desired
* Import the metric results into your own internal systems
* View results in a tabular format

To generate the results, do the following:

1. On the Metrics impact tab, under Results, the Share results list is on the right side of the page, above the metric cards.
2. Click **Share results**. This allows you to view the list of format options.

3. Click your chosen format. Your browser downloads the file. A message appears on the page when the file has finished downloading. 

When you click Copy URL, this copies a URL link to your current view in the Split app to your clipboard but does not download a file.

## Available formats

You can generate a report containing your metrics impact results in the below formats:

### CSV
This format contains the observed metric data and the results of the statistical analyses. The report contains one row per metric and is intended to be human readable as well as appropriate for further manual analyses or reporting.

### JSON
This format contains the observed metric data, the results of the statistical analyses, as well as the statistical settings and metric definitions at the time of analysis. This format is intended for ingesting data into other tools and databases.

### PDF
This format presents a visual representation of your metrics impact results, similar to the Split user interface. This format is ideal for sharing results with stakeholders and for quickly understanding the high level outcomes of your tests.

### Copy URL
This copies a URL link to your current view in the Split app to your clipboard. This does require that anyone you share this with must have a Split account.
