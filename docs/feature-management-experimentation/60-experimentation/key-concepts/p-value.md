The **p-value** is the probability of observing a result at least as extreme as the one seen in your experiment, assuming the **null hypothesis** is true (i.e., that your treatment had no effect).

In practice, p-values are used to determine **statistical significance**. If your p-value is lower than your chosen significance threshold (commonly 0.05), the result is considered statistically significant.

For more information about p-values, see [Statistical significance](./statistical-significance).
