## Key Experimentation concepts

Experimentation is a process of testing software variants among randomized user groups to measure outcomes with statistical rigor. The following terms are foundational to understanding and running effective experiments.

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| [Statistical significance](./statistical-significance) | A measure of whether observed differences in outcomes are likely due to chance or reflect a real effect. |
| [P-value](./p-value) | The probability of observing results as extreme as the current data, assuming the null hypothesis is true. |
| [Frequentist vs Bayesian](./frequentist-vs-bayesian) | Two statistical approaches: Frequentist relies on long-run frequencies, while Bayesian incorporates prior beliefs. |
| [Fixed horizon](./fixed-horizon) | A testing approach where results are only analyzed after collecting a pre-specified amount of data. |
| [Sequential testing](./fixed-horizon) | A method allowing results to be checked continuously without inflating false-positive rates. |
| [Multiple comparison correction (MCC)](./multiple-comparison-correction) | Techniques used to reduce error rates when multiple hypotheses are tested simultaneously. |
| [Sample size calculator](./sample-size-calculator) | A tool for estimating how many users are needed in a test to detect a meaningful effect with desired confidence. |
