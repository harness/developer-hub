## Overview

Harness FME lets anyone roll out features and experiment with a target group of users across the full stack: from deep in the back end to client-facing JavaScript and mobile applications. Features can be released to a small subset of users to gather usability feedback or measure performance, then rolled out to everyone, or rolled back with the click of a button if bugs appear.

This methodology is called feature experimentation.

## Maintain stickiness of randomization

Harness FME provides out-of-the box SDKs for 10 different languages. [These SDKs](/docs/feature-management-experimentation/sdks-and-infrastructure) can be imported into a project within minutes, and are designed to deterministically bucket customers so that, given a rollout plan, a user will receive a consistent experience across all of FME SDKs.

In each supported language, the SDK client is designed to be a fully contained decision engine. This means the Harness FME back end is not involved in making the choice of treatment a customer will be served. Rather, the SDK simply polls Harness FME servers on a regular basis to store the most up-to-date rollout plans you set in Harness FME.

The FME SDK is making that decision at runtime with the most up to date targeting information. For example, you might want to show a feature only to someone who logged in at least 10 times. Since this is a dynamically changing count, you’ll want to make a decision in your code at runtime rather than pass the login count to Harness servers and have to wait for a decision to come back.

This decision engine is architected so that when you use FME to randomly assign customers into 50%-on and 50%-off buckets it can perform the randomization without needing to call back to Harness servers. Harness FME built the same deterministic hashing algorithm across all of our SDKs to maintain the same sticky bucketing across any language.

## Measure experiments across all levels of the stack

Split’s Intelligent Results Engine has been built from the ground up to ingest important data about the performance of your company and products; at multiple points in time during an experiment and from any level of the stack. This design is critical to allow for experimentation on features supported by the backend that might have an impact on your customer’s user experience.

Take the feature of search for any e-commerce business as an example. e-commerce companies constantly iterate through different search algorithms to improve the display of the most relevant items to visitors of the site. Their goal is to eliminate as many blockers as possible in getting customers to checkout.

To properly run this experiment, the decision making must be done on the server side so that only one set of search results is passed to the front end. However, the important metric to improve is a click on checkout, which is triggered on the front end. To solve for this, the Split platform is architected to automatically capture the search algorithm that is used on the backend, and then separately ingest the appropriate checkout click event from the front end. The Results Engine will examine the unique keys of the user that triggered a specific search algorithm and performed checkout clicks and automatically join those disparate data points. The engine will analyze how a change on the backend impacted a metric you track only on the front end.

## Leverage a single source of truth in a distributed microservices architecture

Many of Split’s customers use Split in a microservices architecture where sessions are not sticky to a given server. In this case, in order to make sure that each service has a single source of truth on the current state of rollout plans, we recommend using the [Split Synchronizer](/docs/feature-management-experimentation/sdks-and-infrastructure/optional-infra/split-synchronizer) in conjunction with our native SDKs.

The Split Synchronizer is a separate service written in Go that you can run natively or via Docker. It will automatically take care of all communication between your servers and Split servers, and automatically populate rollout plan updates to a Redis instance.

When you instantiate our SDKs on your microservices, you would then configure them to pull information from the shared Redis instance rather than having them communicate directly with our servers. This will ensure that every service in your network is making treatment assignment decisions based on a common state of your rollout plans.

## Provide a unified experience across web and mobile

What if you have a hybrid web-mobile stack? In a hybrid web-mobile world, a user should be able to access a new feature whether using the web or a mobile app. A lack of consistency in customer experience can lead to customer frustration.

If a critical bug appears in a newly-released mobile feature a fix typically can’t be delivered in minutes due to App Store approval delays; the minimum turnaround time is usually days. If customers keep experiencing app crashes or a poor experience their trust erodes.

To make sure you can consistently turn features on and off across web front end, web backend, and mobile we recommend that Split users wrap one of the server-side libraries in a small service, hosted on their infrastructure. This allows mobile apps to query the service at startup to know which features are to be turned on or off.

:::info
Split has written a simple implementation of this approach that you can clone for reference or run natively in Docker.

This approach has a number of advantages for our customers:

* Uniform experience across devices, versions and viewports: Since the web app can query the same service, our customers can be confident that their users will see a feature as on or off, regardless of whether they access the product via mobile or web. Thus, calling home is portable.
* Update your platform without touching the app: Split is a core piece of our customers’ infrastructure and is always improving. By hosting Split on the server-side, our customers can confidently upgrade their server-side Split library without worrying about older, possibly conflicting, versions of Split being used in older mobile apps. Thus, calling home avoids versioning headaches.
* No impact to File Size: By hosting the library on the server side, our customers need never worry about increasing the footprint of their mobile app by adding Split’s library. Thus, calling home is safe.
