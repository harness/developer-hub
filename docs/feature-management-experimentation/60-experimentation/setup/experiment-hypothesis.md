## Constructing a hypothesis

A key step in developing and designing an experiment is constructing a hypothesis. To help you structure your hypothesis in a meaningful way, we've provided a framework below with two helpful templates -- a simple one, and an advanced one.

## Hypothesis Framework

1. Define the **problem**: What is the rationale for experimenting? What do you want to learn? What data do you have to inform your design? *(Problem)*

1. Define the **solution**: What are ways in which you can change the experiences? What strategy will dictate the tactic for the experiment? *(Strategy and Tactic)*

1. Define the measures for **success**: What proves this hypothesis to be true? What is the expected outcome? *(Result)*

### Simple Hypothesis Template

1. Because we observed *motivating data* or *feedback*,
1. We expect that *change* will cause *expected metric impact*.

### Advanced Hypothesis Template

1. *(TACTIC)* By introducing *X change* 
1. *(STRATEGY)* We can *remove/create/reduce X*
1. *(RESULT)* And *increase/decrease X metric*  
1. *(TACTIC)* By/with *X solution and tactic*
