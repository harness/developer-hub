Power measures an experiment's ability to detect an effect, if possible. Formally, the power of an experiment is the probability of rejecting a false null hypothesis.

A commonly used value for statistical power is 80%, which means that the metric has 80% chance of reaching significance if the true impact is equal to the minimum likely detectable effect. Assuming all else is equal, a higher power increases the recommended sample size needed for your feature flag. In statistical terms, the power threshold is equivalent to 1 - Î².
