The Split FME attribution engine assigns a <Link to="../user-key">user key</Link> to a <Link to="../feature-flags/evaluating-a-feature-flag">feature flag evaluation</Link> and an <Link to="../events">event</Link>. The assignment is random and once assigned will be retained to ensure a consistent user experience.
