The traffic type groups a set of user keys. Feature flags and metrics are defined for specific traffic types.

See the <Link to="./fme-architectural-diagram">Split FME architectural diagram</Link> to see how traffic types are organized.

:::info Default traffic types
The `user` and (optionally) `account` traffic types are created for your Split FME account by default. You can create additional traffic types and delete traffic types in your Split Admin settings.
