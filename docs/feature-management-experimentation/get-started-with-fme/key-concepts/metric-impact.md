Metric impact measures the effect a feature has on a key performance indicator (KPI). Metric impact is given as a percentage.

Metric impact is a comparison of two feature variations (or the feature 'on' and 'off' variation).

The  metric impact is the percentage increase in the mean value of a metric calculation. The metric impact of treatment A compared to treatment B is calculated using the formula:

![The percentage impact of treatment A compared treatment B equals the mean of treatment A minus the mean of treatment B, divided by the mean of treatment B, all multiplied by one hundred](./static/metric-impact-formula.png)
