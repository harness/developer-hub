Some metrics are created automatically when specific events are recieved by Split Cloud. Learn more about these events.

[todo: put cards for three types of RUM metrics here]

You can edit these automatically created metrics. You can set up <Link to="./../alerts/guardrail-metric-alerts">alerts</Link> or set the metrics as <Link to="./guardrail-metrics">guardrail</Link> or <Link to="./key-metrics">key</Link> metrics.
