Some metrics are created automatically when specific events are recieved by Split FME Cloud. These metrics are also called out-of-the-box (OOTB) metrics. Learn more about these metrics.

[todo: put cards for three types of RUM metrics here]

You can edit these automatically created metrics. You can set up <Link to="../alerts/guardrail-metric-alerts">alerts</Link> or set the metrics as <Link to="./guardrail-metrics">guardrail</Link> or <Link to="./key-metrics">key</Link> metrics.
