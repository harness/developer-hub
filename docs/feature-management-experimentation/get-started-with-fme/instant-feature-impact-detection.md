Split Feature Management & Experimentation (FME) can alert you to the features (and feature variations) that have significant impact on specific performance metrics. You select and set metric alerting, and the alert will link you to the feature treatment (variation) that measured significant impact, compared with the same feature's baseline treatment. This way, you can instantly see the cause of any negative impact and rollback the misperforming feature variation. On the other hand, positive IFID alerts can lead you to rollout beneficial features with greater speed and confidence.
