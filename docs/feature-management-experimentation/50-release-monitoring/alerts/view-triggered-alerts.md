## Overview

The **Monitoring** tab provides real-time insights into your feature flag's traffic and a summary of alerts that have fired. This data can be used to identify unexpected trends or issues that require troubleshooting.

The **Monitoring** tab includes the following sections:

## Traffic insights

This section visualizes the number of unique keys (users, accounts, or your defined traffic type) served each treatment over the selected time period. The data is shown in a line graph, with each line corresponding to a selected treatment. If a time range is selected that spans across versions, vertical lines indicate when a new feature flag version was created. 

Additionally, a table displays a summary of unique keys and total impressions per treatment.
