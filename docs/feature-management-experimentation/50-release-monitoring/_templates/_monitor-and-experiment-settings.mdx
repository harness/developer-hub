Whether you are releasing new functionality or running an experiment, Split analyzes the change in your metrics. This allows you to determine whether the impact is positive and statistically significant and not happening by chance. You can ensure the analyses are run in the way which best suits your use cases by configuring your statistical settings. For example, you can adjust parameters such as the significance threshold. This controls your chances of seeing false positive results. You can set it higher for a faster time to significance or lower to filter more reliable results, which reflects your preferred balance between confidence and time.

There are two types of statistical settings:

* [Monitor settings](#monitor-settings). Impacts how your alert policies are triggered
* [Experiment settings](#experiment-settings). Impacts how your metric impact results are analyzed

You can set account-wide defaults by configuring your account's statistical settings in the Admin settings section. These settings are used to trigger all alert policies and uncustomized feature flags, and they are applied by default for all newly created feature flags.

You can also configure the experiment threshold of your feature flags individually by customizing their settings. The settings used for a particular environment's results within a particular feature flag can be individually customized. When you customize your experiment settings at the feature flag-level, the new settings are immediately applied to all versions of the feature flag only in the particular environment you customized. For example, you could set a particular feature flag to use different experiment settings in the staging and production environments. Customizing experiment settings at the feature flag-level has no impact on your other feature flags or any of your alert policies.

## Changing the settings

The following explains how to change your account- and feature flag-level settings. Account-wide settings trigger all alert policies and uncustomized feature flags, and they are applied by default for all newly created feature flags. Feature flag-level settings are individually customized for a particular environment's results within a particular feature flag.

### Changing account-wide settings

To change your account-wide settings, do the following:

**Important: The testing method menu list only applies to results that are in your user interface. It doesn't apply to your alerts.**

1. From the left navigation, click the **user's initials** at the bottom and then **Admin settings**. 
2. Click the **Monitor window and statistics** selection. The Monitor window and statistics page appears.

 </p>

3. Adjust your settings and and when done, click **Save**.

___Note: Changing your statistical settings instantly affects your entire account.___ _All alert policies are analyzed against the new settings in future. All feature flags which are not customized (i.e., those for which the Always use account-wide settings checkbox is checked in their experiment settings) are also analyzed using these new settings._

_For example, if your experiment is showing metrics as having a statistically positive impact at a .05 significant threshold, and you change your significance threshold from 0.05 to 0.01, the next time you load your metrics impact page you may see that metrics are no longer marked as having a significant impact._

### Changing feature flag-level settings

___Note: When you change the experiment settings for a feature flag, it immediately affects all versions of that flag in the environment for which you customized the settings.___ _Versions in other environments, other feature flags in your account, and all alert policies aren't affected by your customization. Customizations apply to specific environments. If your feature flag has multiple environments, each must be customized separately._

To change the settings of a feature flag, do the following:

1. From the left navigation, select a feature flag.
2. Click the **Metrics impact** and then **Experiment settings** tabs. Be sure that you select the right environment, or change the selection in the environment menu list in the top section to customize a different environment.

3. To set a specific setting for a specific experiment, uncheck the **Always use account-wide settings** selection and modify the setting you want to change.
4. After you adjust your settings, click **Save**.

___Note:___ _When the **Always use account-wide settings** checkbox is selected, the settings for a flag update whenever your account-wide settings are changed._ _When it's not selected, the settings no longer reflect any changes to your account-wide settings._
