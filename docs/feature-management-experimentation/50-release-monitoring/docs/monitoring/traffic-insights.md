The Monitoring tab provides real-time insights into your feature flag's traffic.

## Traffic insights chart

The traffic insights chart shows the number of unique keys (users, accounts, or your defined traffic type) served each treatment over the selected time period. The data is shown in a line graph, with each line corresponding to a selected treatment. If a time range is selected that spans across versions, vertical lines indicate when a new feature flag version was created. Additionally, a table displays a summary of unique keys and total impressions per treatment.
