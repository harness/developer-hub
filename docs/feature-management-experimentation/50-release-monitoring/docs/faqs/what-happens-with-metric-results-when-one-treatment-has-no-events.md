### Question

<p>
  What happens on my metric cards when I don't have events coming in for one treatment?
  Will I get statistical significance? How should I view my metric card?
</p>

### Answer

<p>
  The system will test the difference between any mean values, even if one of them happens to be 0. As a result, you can still get statistically significant results, a card that turns red or green.
</p>
<p>
  In this scenario we use the absolute change instead of the relative change. If
  one treatment is 0 and the other treatment isn't 0, as long as there is a relevant
  sample size and the appropriate variance in the data, the stats calculations
  are not impacted.
</p>
<p>
  In this case, the table on the Details and Trends page will show the appropriate
  data for the treatments.

</p>
<p>
  In addition to seeing no events in the table for one of the treatments, the chart
  for Impact over time will be blank, reinforcing that we are using the absolute
  change.

</p>
<p>
  But if you select Values over time, then you will see the means metric value
  for all of the treatments. A treatment that has no events will have the metric
  value zero.
