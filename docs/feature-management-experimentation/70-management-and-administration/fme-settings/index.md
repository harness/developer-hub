FME settings allow you to control how flags, experiments, and metrics behave within your environments. These settings are specific to the Harness FME module and affect how experimentation and rollout workflows are configured.

:::note
These settings are separate from account-level settings such as user access and project configuration. For more information, see [Account Settings](../account-settings/).
