Account settings allow you to control user access, project structure, and authentication for your Harness FME account. These settings define who can log in, how users are organized, and which projects and environments they can access.

:::note
These settings are separate from FME-specific configurations such as environments, flag permissions, and rollout approvals. For more information, see [FME Settings](../fme-settings/).
