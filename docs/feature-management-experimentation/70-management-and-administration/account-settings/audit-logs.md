| --- | --- | --- |
| Adding tags | Adding tags | Adding tags |
| Removing tags | Removing tags | Removing tags |
| Adding owners | Adding owners | Adding owners |
| Removing owners | Removing owners | Removing owners |
| Creating targeting rules | Adding members | Creating a metric |
| Updating targeting rules | Removing members | Updating a metric definition |
| Killing a feature flag | | Creating an alert policy |
| Reallocating a feature flag | | Updating an alert policy |
| | | Removing an alert policy |

## Titles and comments in changes
When you click review changes after making a change to a feature flag, segment, or metric, a panel displays offering a diff view of the changed elements. You can enter a title and comments for the change made to make it easier for teammates to understand why the change was made. If you want to make titles and comments required for all changes in a project, refer to the [Projects](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360023534451-Projects#editing-a-project) guide for more information.
