For increased login security, you can add two-factor authentication (2FA) for your Harness FME account. With 2FA enabled, Harness FME asks you to enter a verification code after authentication.

## Setup
 
Set up 2FA in a few steps: 

1. In the left navigation, click on the **profile button** at the bottom, and go to **Personal Settings** > **Security**.
2. Click **Enable Two-Factor Authentication**.
3. Download an authenticator app like Google Authenticator.
4. Scan the QR code on your screen.
5. Enter the 6-digit verification code generated by the app to complete setup.
6. On your next login, you are prompted to enter a code generated from the authentication app on your smartphone.

## Manage
 
### See 2FA status for users

Administrators can see which users on your team have set up two-factor authentication. In **Admin Settings** > **Users**, column 2FA shows a user's 2FA status (enabled or disabled).

### Disable 2FA for someone who cannot sign in

Administrators can disable 2FA for users on their team: 

1. Go to **Admin Settings** > **Users**.
2. Click **Disable 2FA** in the Action column next to a user's name.

### Session reset

By default, we do not automatically kill active user sessions. However, team administrators can kill an active user session and force them to log out.

Administrators can do this by going to Admin settings > Users and then clicking Force Logout in the Action column next to a user’s name.

After you force a session to reset, the affected team member is automatically logged out of Harness FME. This user must sign in again and complete two-factor authentication if it has been set up.

## Deactivate or reactivate a user

Administrators can take a number of actions to help manage users in their Harness FME account.

### Deactivate a user

1. From the left navigation, click the **profile button** at the bottom, select **Admin settings** and then **Users**.
1. Click **Deactivate** next to a user’s name. The user’s status changes to **Inactive**.

When the user’s login is deactivated, they cannot access your account in Harness FME and cannot reactivate their own login.

### Reactivate a user

1. From the left navigation, click the **profile button** at the bottom, select **Admin settings** and then **Users**.
1. Click **Activate** next to a user’s name. The user’s status changes to **Active**.

When the user’s login is activated, they can access your account in Harness FME.

## Unblock a user

### Password reset

A user can go through the password reset flow to unblock their login.

1. Go to [app.split.io/login](https://app.split.io/login).
1. Click **Forgot?**.
1. Enter your email.
1. Follow the instructions sent to the email, provided the user exists.

### Admin intervention

An administrator can unblock users in Admin settings.

1. From the left navigation pane, click the project switcher at the bottom and select **Admin settings**.
1. Click **Users**.
1. If the user's status is blocked, click **Unblock** next to the username. The user’s status changes to **Active**.

## FAQs
 
### I've deleted or can't find the authenticator app used to enable two-factor authentication. How can I log in? 

If you lose your phone or no longer have access to the authentication app used during setup, use one of the recovery codes provided when you set up two-factor authentication for your account.

You can use any of these codes to access your account. **Note that each recovery code can only be used once.**

:::note
While the recovery codes allow you to access Harness FME in an emergency, you should contact your team's Administrator to disable two-factor authentication and then complete the setup process again. If you do not have access to the recovery codes, your team's administrator can disable two-factor authentication for your account.
