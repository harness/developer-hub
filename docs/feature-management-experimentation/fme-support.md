<!-- TODO: ask CS if we can get 'Feature Management & Experimentation listed on the ideas portal

### Request a new feature

Have a fantastic idea? Please go to our [Idea Portal](https://ideas.harness.io) and submit it.

Submitting your ideas is super easy, simply follow these steps:

1. Navigate to [https://ideas.harness.io](https://ideas.harness.io) (directly or from the product)
2. Select the module as Software Engineering Insights.
3. Search to see if your idea has already been proposed. If so, you can "vote up" for it, increasing its chances of being considered. You will be notified of the status and progress of your idea.
4. If your desired feature hasn’t been suggested yet, complete the form (provide a title and a short description). Once submitted, you will be notified of the status and progress of your idea.

And that’s it!

#### What’s Next?

The product management team will triage these submitted ideas, ask questions if needed, allow all users interested in participating in the conversation, and provide updates on the progress and ETA. Users will automatically be notified on each change of tickets that they are subscribed to (either voted on or created the feature request).
