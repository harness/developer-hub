Segment allows you to easily manage integrations with multiple analytics services. By tracking events and users via Segment’s API and libraries, you can send your product’s data to all of your analytics and marketing platforms, with minimal instrumentation code. They offer support for most platforms, including iOS, Android, JavaScript, Node.js, PHP, and more.
 
Use this integration to:

* Send data from Harness FME as a source in Segment. When configured, FME sends traffic impression data for feature flags to Segment.

* Send data to Harness FME as a destination in Segment. When configured, FME processes and displayes Segment event data in Harness FME for analysis. FME supports the `identify`, `group`, `track`, `page` and `screen` specs. FME and Segment let you change these integration settings via your Segment and Harness FME dashboards without having to touch any code. 
 
This documentation provides additional details on the different types of Segment integrations you can use, how they affect your data in Harness FME, and instructions for setting up the integration.

## Segment spec details 

### Identify

The `identify` call lets you tie a user to their actions and record traits about them. When you enable in Harness FME and call the `identify` function, Segment passes that ID's information to FME with `userId` (or `anonymousId`) as the FME traffic type you selected when configuring the integration. Traits are mapped to traffic type attributes in FME. Learn more about attributes in Harness FME [here](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360020529772-Identifying-customers).

Read more on Segment's `identify` spec [here](https://segment.com/docs/spec/identify/).

### Track
The `track` call lets you record any actions your users perform, along with any properties that describe the action. When you enable in Harness FME and call the `track` function, FME records events within Harness FME. Learn more about Harness FME's events [here](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360020585772).

Read more on Segment's `track` spec [here](https://segment.com/docs/spec/track/).

### Page
The `page` call lets you record whenever a user sees a page of your website, along with any optional properties about the page. When you enable in Harness FME and call the `page` function FME records events for `page` method calls that have a name associated with them. For example, `page('signup')` translates to `view_signup_page`.

Read more on Segment's `page` spec [here](https://segment.com/docs/spec/page/).

### Screen
The `screen` call lets you record whenever a user sees a screen, the mobile equivalent of page, in your mobile app, along with any properties about the screen. When you enable in Harness FME and call the `screen` function, FME records events for `screen` method calls that have a name associated with them. For example, `screen('signup')` translates to `view_signup_screen`.

Read more on Segment's `screen` spec [here](https://segment.com/docs/spec/screen/).

### Group
The `group` call allows you to associate an individual user with a group of users. FME associates a group with the particular traffic type you configure. Learn more about using the group methods in the advanced functionality below. 

Read more on Segment's `group` spec [here](https://segment.com/docs/spec/group/).

## Advanced functionality

### Set event-level groups via .track()
To support mapping events across multiple traffic types (for example, fire a `track` event for a user and an account), Harness FME supports setting event-level groups. The group designation only applies for the specific event being logged. To specify these groups, provide an integration-specific property with key-value pairs corresponding to traffic type name in FME and the ID of the customer in FME. An example call is shown below. 

```json
{
  "anonymousId": "23adfd82-aa0f-45a7-a756-24f2a7a4c895",
  ...
  "messageId": "ajs-f8ca1e4de5024d9430b3928bd8ac6b96",
  "properties": {
        "split": [{
            "account": "4d3405a0-9ca5-11e5-9706-16a11fb02dec" ### key
        }],
 ...
  "type": "track",
  "userId": "41e51150-6825-11e8-9f57-0acd31e5aef0",
  "originalTimestamp": "2015-12-12T19:11:01.152Z"
}
```

#### Identify additional traffic types in Harness FME via .group()

Harness FME supports the ability to identify multiple traffic types (for example, identifying accounts) within FME via Segment's `group` method. To specify these groups, provide an integration-specific trait with key-value pair corresponding to traffic type name in FME and the ID of the customer in FME that you want to identify. If Harness FME can identify an FME traffic type in the traits, all additional traits are created as attributes of the traffic type and the values mapped to the key provided.

```json
{
  "anonymousId": "23adfd82-aa0f-45a7-a756-24f2a7a4c89",
  ...
  "messageId": "022bb90c-bbac-11e4-8dfc-aa07a5b093db",
  ...
  "traits": {
     "split": {
           "account": "4d3405a0-9ca5-11e5-9706-16a11fb02dec" ### key
         },    
     ...
     }
  "type": "group",
  "userId": "7f244b10-9ca5-11e5-9706-16a11fb02dec",
  "groupId": "4d3405a0-9ca5-11e5-9706-16a11fb02dec",
  ...
}
```

## FAQs

#### What happens if the eventTypeId field has spaces in Segment?
If the name has a space, Harness FME replaces the space with an underscore changing `sample event` to `sample_event` when it appears in the Harness FME user interface.

#### What does Harness FME do if the eventTypeId field is not mapped correctly?
The `eventTypeId` field is required, so if name does not map correctly or does not match the configuration settings, the event is dropped.

#### What does Harness FME do if the eventTypeId field is mapped correctly, but the value field is not?
The `value` field is optional. If `eventTypeId` is mapped correctly but the `value` field does not align with the configuration settings, the `value` field is null in Harness FME.

#### What happens in Harness FME if we have traits.company in our identify call?
Passing `traits.company` is received as a string version of the object in FME as an attribute `company`. We recommend flattening the object if you want to see this data in Harness FME.

#### What size limits does Harness FME have on trait values?
Trait values are limited to 255 characters.
