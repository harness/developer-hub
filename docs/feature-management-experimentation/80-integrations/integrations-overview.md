Split supports integrations with a number of third parties. This category of articles documents how to setup each integration.

Split supports an integration with Google Analytics via an SDK-to-SDK integration as part of the standard javascript SDK.

Split also supports server-to-server integrations that can be configured in the Admin Settings of our application. Each workspace you configure will have their own set of integrations. As you can see from the image below, when you click to the *Integrations* page, you will be able to select any of your workspaces to then configure integrations for that workspace.

Once you have selected a workspace, you will be brought to a page to select an integration to configure. If you would like to configure integrations for a workspace, you can select the dropdown at the top of the page to navigate to another workspace.
