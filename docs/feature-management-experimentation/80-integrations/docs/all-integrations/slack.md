**Note: The following Slack integration is in beta. If you'd like to be included in this, contact [support@split.io](mailto:support@split.io).**

The Slack integration allows teams to stay up to date on changes they care about in Split. By combining Split's rollout capabilities with Slack, you can:

* Keep your team notified about feature flag and segment changes
* Subscribe to the changes you care about by filtering notifications by Split project, environment, type (e.g., feature flag and segment), and action (e.g., create, update, delete)

With this integration, as a Slack user, you can subscribe channels to notifications based on filters that they set. Once these filters are set up by that user, any Slack user in that channel can see any event that exists that meets the filter criteria in that channel. In addition, you can see notifications relevant to you, specifically in the Split Slack App on the messages tab.

**Note: If you are having trouble completing the integration, contact [support@split.io](mailto:support@split.io).**

   </p>

## Using Split commands

You can interact with the Slack app to initiate initial configuration, subscription management, and help documentation using the following commands:

* /split configure
* /split subscribe
* /split subscriptions
* /split help


### Using the configure command

**Note: Only admins have access to the Split token that is needed to enter in the configure modal.**

Use the `/split configure` command to display the Configure Split app modal. When you enter your Split token and submit it here, this links the Slack app with your Split account. Note that you only need to use this command if you didn’t previously click the Configure button in the welcome message.

**Note: If there is a problem with the token validation, an error message displays when you click the Submit button.**

### Create a channel subscription

Use the `/split subscribe` command to create a channel subscription, which subscribes your Slack channel to Split notifications. The Channel menu list is pre-selected with the current channel. However, a user can select a different channel if desired. Optionally select your desired filter criteria and click **Submit** to create the channel subscription. 

<p>

**Note: If you select a private channel, you get an error message indicating that the channel is private.**

## Managing subscriptions

The `/split subscriptions` command lists out the available subscriptions within the current channel, displaying a filter summary for each, and allows you to edit and delete subscriptions.

### Edit a subscription

To make a change to a subscription, click the **Edit** button next to the desired subscription. The Edit Subscription modal displays pre-populated with the subscription’s filter criteria. Make the desired changes and click the **Submit** button. You get a message indicating that the subscription is updated.


### Delete a subscription

Delete a subscription by clicking the **Delete** button next to a given subscription. You’re prompted with a confirmation message indicating that notification matching the subscription will be removed. Click the **Confirm** button to finish deleting the subscription.
