Papertrail provides cloud-hosted log management solutions. Integrate with Papertrail to get Split rollout and rollback events in Papertrail. These events can be overlayed with any other log data to quickly detect and correlate application issues with Split changes.

1. Log in to your Papertrail account.
2. Go to [https://papertrailapp.com/systems/setup](https://papertrailapp.com/systems/setup).
3. Copy the log destination ([host] and [port] information) required for this integration.
