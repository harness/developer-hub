AppDynamics allows users to proactively monitor, manage, and optimize the most complex software environments. Harness FME integrates with AppDynamics to provide custom events in AppDynamics highlighting Harness FME changes.

If you have trouble completing the integration, contact us at [support@split.io](mailto:support@split.io).

:::info[Integration requirements]
The Harness FME pre-built integration with AppDynamics does not support AppDynamics On-Premise (self-hosted) solution.
