System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) is an open standard that allows admins to automate user and group provisioning. SCIM communicates user and group information between identity providers (e.g., Okta) and service providers requiring user and group information (Split). With SCIM, IT administrators can govern Split users and groups within their own identity provider Okta.

## Enabling SCIM for Okta

You can enable SCIM user provisioning to work with your SSO-strict enabled account. SCIM facilitates user provisioning which allows your IdP to create, update, and deactivate members in Split. You can:

* Enable SCIM for your Split organization
* Connect Split to Okta
* Create and manage users and groups in Split directly from Okta 

:::info
Once SCIM is enabled for your organization, 

* You must add new users in Okta to give them access to Split. You can't invite new users to Split and any existing open invites are revoked.
* **User management actions such as Deactivate and Activate is disabled in Split. Okta administrators control the user management within Okta.**
* **Groups that are synced from Okta are uneditable in Split. If you want to change the members in a group, the Okta administrators can push them over.**
:::

## Enabling SCIM for your Split organization

**Prerequisite: You must enable SAML in SSO Strict mode to use this capability. Refer to the Single sign-on with Okta guide to enable SAML before configuring SCIM.**

To enable SCIM for your Split organization, do the following:

1. From the left navigation, select **Admin settings** and then **Security**. Click the **SCIM** tab on the Security Settings page.

</p>

2. The default IDP selection is Okta. Click SCIM toggle to **On**. 
3. The SCIM enable modal appears. Two pieces of information display and must be copied:

   * Access tokens. Be sure to copy and store this token in a safe location as you won’t be able to access this token again. This only displays once. If you do lose it, you can regenerate a new token.
   * SCIM connector base URL 

**Note: For security reasons, the access token is valid for one year from the time it's created. At the end of this period, administrators should regenerate this token and update Okta with the new token to continue using the SCIM functionality.**

## Connecting Split to Okta

To connect Split to Okta, do the following:

**Notes:**
  * **Only an Okta administrator can do the following setup on the Okta app.**
  * **The group name Administrators is a reserved keyword in Split and cannot be overridden. It must have at least one member.**

1. Log into your Okta administrator account, select **Applications**, and then **Split**. This should already be set up for you if you enabled SAML. 
2. On the App settings modal under General, click **Edit** and select **Enable SCIM provisioning**. 
3. Click **Save**.

4. Click the **Provisioning** tab and then **Edit**. Fill in the fields as follows:

   * In the SCIM connector base URL field, copy and paste the connector base URL generated in Split when you enabled SCIM.
   * In the Unique identifier field for the user, enter **email**. This is case sensitive.
   * On the Supported provisioning actions selections, select **Push new users**, **Push profile updates**, and **Push groups**.
   * In the Authentication mode list, select **HTTP header**. The HTTP header field appears.
   * In the Token field of Authorization, copy and paste the access token generated when you enabled SCIM into the field.

The SCIM connection setup between Okta and Split is now complete and we are ready to provision users and groups to Split.

## Provisioning users from Okta to Split

**Note: Be aware that because users are pushed from Okta, they are now IdP managed and you can’t deactivate them from Split. Go back to Okta to deactivate them.**

You can provision users by doing the following:

1. In Okta, click the **Assignments** tab.

5. To ensure the person is added, from the Admin settings of the Split application, under Organizational settings, click **Users**. The new user appears in the list.

## Provisioning groups from Okta to Split

**Notes**

**Be aware that:**

* **Because groups are pushed from Okta, they are now IdP managed and you can’t deactivate them from Split. Go back to Okta to deactivate them.**
* **Group name length should be less than 25 characters.**

You can assign groups by doing the following:

1. In Okta, click the **Assignments** tab.

6. To configure the Push groups to Split, click the **Push groups** button and then **Find groups by name**.
7. Enter the name of the group in Okta that you want to push. From here, you can either create a group or link a group and click **Save**:
   * **Create a new group.** Creates a new group in Split by this name. If a group by the same name exists in Split, you must use the Link a group option. All members of the Group are synced with Split.
   * **Link a group.** Links an existing group.
8. To ensure the group is added, from the Admin settings of the Split application, under Organizational settings, click **Groups**. The new group appears in the list as a View Only group. All further changes to the group are managed in Okta.

2. Click the **Regenerate** link next to the access token. You now have a new access token.

## Disabling SCIM

**Warning: If you disable SCIM, you must set up the connection between Okta and Split again.**

**Important: All IDP-synced groups and users are converted to Split groups and users. You must map these again on re-enablement.**

To disable SCIM, do the following:

1. In Admin Settings, select **Security** and then the **SCIM** tab.
2. Click the SCIM toggle. A message appears with a text box to type DISABLE.
