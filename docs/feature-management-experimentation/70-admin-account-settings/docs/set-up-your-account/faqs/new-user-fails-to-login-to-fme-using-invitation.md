## Problem

Invitation is sent successfully to a user for given organization, however, when they set the password and click Login button, nothing happen, the login screen does not change.

## Root cause

There are multiple root causes:

* The same user ID (email address) exists in another organization. Split platform does not allow users to belong to multiple organizations.
* The invitation link has expired.
* The user is trying to use Google Authentication to log in to Split for the first time, not Split authentication.

## Solution

There are few solutions if the user email exist in another organization:

1. User login to their account, then go to My settings, as shown in screenshot below.

2. Then change their email address to one other than their official work email.

3. Use the same email with the addition of (+1) to the id, the email server will accept and relay the email to the same account, and Split platform will treat it as a different email, for example: for first.last@email.com the suggested email to use is first.last+1@email.com.

4. Contact Split support (via support@split.io or this page) to delete the existing account, then create a new invite.
