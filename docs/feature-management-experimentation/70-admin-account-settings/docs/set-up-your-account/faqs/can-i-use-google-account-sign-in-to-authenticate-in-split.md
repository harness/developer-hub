## Question

Is it possible to use Google account sign In to authenticate when logging in to the Split user interface?

## Answer

Yes, users can authenticate in app.split.io user interface using Google account sign in, providing the login id (email address) used in Split user interface matches the Gmail account.

:::note
If you are a new user, the account in Split must be activated before the Google authentication can be used. When you click the Split invite link, make sure to set the password and login to Split, before using Google authentication.
