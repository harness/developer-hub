## Question

When receiving an invite URL link from the Split organization admin, how long is the link valid for?

## Answer

The Invitation link sent to new users will expire within 2 weeks from the time they are sent.
If they are used after expiration, the login page will not change after updating the login email and password, and no account is created on Split cloud.
