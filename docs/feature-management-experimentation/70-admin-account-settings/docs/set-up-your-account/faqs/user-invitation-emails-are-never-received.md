## Problem

Invitation is sent successfully to a user for given organization, however, user never receive the email that has the invitation link.

## Root cause

Split backend servers use SendGrid email service to send emails, this is an enterprise subscription-based service which is usually individually targeted  for businesses. It is possible that emails from SendGrid is not individually targeted which will block incoming emails from Split.io.

## Solution

Contact your IT and request an individually targeted SendGrid service.
