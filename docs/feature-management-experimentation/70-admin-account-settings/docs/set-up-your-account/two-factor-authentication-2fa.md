For increased login security, you can add two-factor authentication (2FA) for your Split account. With 2FA enabled, Split asks you to enter a verification code after authentication.

## Setup
 
Set up 2FA in a few steps: 

1. In the left navigation, click on the **user's initials** at the bottom, and go to **Personal Settings** > **Security**.
2. Click **Enable Two-Factor Authentication**.
3. Download an authenticator app like Google Authenticator.
4. Scan the QR code on your screen.
5. Enter the 6-digit verification code generated by the app to complete setup.
6. On your next login, you are prompted to enter a code generated from the authentication app on your smartphone.

## Manage
 
### See 2FA status for users

Administrators can see which users on your team have set up two-factor authentication. In **Admin Settings** > **Users**, column 2FA shows a user's 2FA status (enabled or disabled).

### Disable 2FA for someone who cannot sign in

Administrators can disable 2FA for users on their team: 

1. Go to **Admin Settings** > **Users**.
2. Click **Disable 2FA** in the Action column next to a user's name.

## FAQs
 
**I've deleted or can't find the authenticator app used to enable two-factor authentication. How can I log in?**

If you lose your phone or no longer have access to the authentication app used during setup, use one of the recovery codes provided when you set up two-factor authentication for your account.

You can use any of these codes to access your account. **Note that each recovery code can only be used once.**

:::info[Note]
While the recovery codes allow you to access Split in an emergency, you should contact your team's Administrator to disable two-factor authentication and then complete the setup process again. If you do not have access to the recovery codes, your team's administrator can disable two-factor authentication for your account.
