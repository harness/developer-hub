Administrators can take a number of actions to help manage users in their Split account.

## Deactivate a user

1. From the left navigation, click the **user's initials** at the bottom, select **Admin settings** and then **Users**.
2. Click **Deactivate** next to a user’s name. The user’s status changes to **Inactive**.

When the user’s login is deactivated, they cannot access your account in Split and cannot reactivate their own login. 

## Reactivate a user

1. From the left navigation, click the **user's initials** at the bottom, select **Admin settings** and then **Users**.
2. Click **Activate** next to a user’s name. The user’s status changes to **Active**.

When the user’s login is activated, they can access your account in Split.
