Split [SDKs](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360033557092-SDK-overview) and [Admin API](https://docs.split.io/reference) both require API keys for authentication.

In Split, there are three types of keys:

* **Server-side** type API keys are recommended to use with SDKs that live in your infrastructure (for example, your servers)

* **Client-side** type API keys are for SDKs living in public environments (for example, browsers or mobile clients)

* **Admin** type API Keys are used for access to Split's [Admin API endpoints](https://docs.split.io/reference).

:::danger[Keep your Server-side and Admin keys private]
Never expose Admin and Server-side keys in untrusted contexts. Do not put your Server-side or Admin API keys in client-side JavaScript or mobile SDKs. Split has special browser keys that you can use in client-side JavaScript, Android, and iOS.
If you accidentally expose your API key, revoke it in the **APIs** tab in **Account settings**. 

Be sure to copy your API Key once it's generated. For security purposes, you won’t see the key again.

## Managing your API keys

To manage your API keys, go to the **API keys** tab in your **Admin Settings** page. On this page you can:

* See a list of all your existing API keys.
* Add additional API keys by clicking **Add API key** in the top right.
* Revoke existing API keys
* Clone existing API keys
