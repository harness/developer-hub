Each Spit project has a project permissions setting which you can use to restrict access to that project to specific users, groups, or API keys. If a user, group, or API key is not granted access to a restricted project, they cannot see the project name nor determine whether that project exists. 

Project view restrictions can be used to protect sensitive (i.e., confidential) projects, or to improve user experience by showing a small number of relevant projects to each user.

## Viewing or updating Project permissions

An Admin can view or edit a project's permissions, by following these steps:

1. Click the **user's initials** at the bottom of the left navigation pane and select **Admin settings**.

2. On the Projects page, click the **View** link for a project.

3. Click the **Actions** button on the top left and select **Edit project**. The Edit project pane will appear.

On the Edit project pane, you can view project permissions. You can also restrict access to the project to some users, groups, and Admin API Keys.
