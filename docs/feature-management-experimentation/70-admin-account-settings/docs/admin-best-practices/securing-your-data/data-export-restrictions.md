An administrator may restrict the export of data from Split to a subset of users or user groups at the environment level. Refer to the [Permissions](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360020579052#data-export-permissions) guide for more information.

A list of all environments in a workspace, showing at a glance whether data export restrictions are in place for each environment, is available to admins. Refer to the [Workspaces](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360023534451-Workspaces) guide for more information.
