By default, we do not automatically kill active user sessions. However, team administrators can kill an active user session and force them to log out.

Administrators can do this by going to **Admin Settings** > **Users** and then clicking **Force Logout** in the Action column next to a user’s name.

After you force a session to reset, the affected team member is automatically logged out of Split. This user must sign in again and complete [two-factor authentication](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360020825212) if it has been set up.
