You will see a list of environments for the selected project, now you can delete each environment using the **Delete** link.
The user interface will allow you to delete all environments except the last one, as each project is required to have at least one environment.
Click the **Actions** button in the top right corner and choose the Delete project option, which will allow you to delete it.
