## Accuracy

<p>
  Please be aware that Switch is an automated system and is currently in Beta.
  It may not always provide 100% accurate information. While we strive to provide
  accurate information, we cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness
  of the information provided by the chatbot. You can always reach out to support
  (link) for additional help
</p>
<p>
  We have experienced that Switch can have hallucinations when asked to return
  a numerical value. When dealing with numbers, the limitations of LLMs can often
  be more pronounced due to the precision and context required in numerical information.
</p>

## Data Security

<p>
  Switch currently only uses publicly available information. No customer data is
  involved.
</p>
<p>
  In a future iteration, there will be features that benefit from ingestion of
  customer data, and users will have to explicitly opt-in if they’d like to use
  these features.
</p>

## Upcoming Enhancements

<p>
  The introduction of Switch is just the beginning, as the forward-looking product
  roadmap of Split reflects a robust integration of AI into its services by introducing
  automated features that simplify and enhance the development process, including:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Automatic Data Interpretation: </strong>Assist users in understanding
    complex metrics and graphs.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Immediately Actionable Insights: </strong>Enabling Switch to not
    only interpret queries but also perform background tasks like API calls.
    This would allow a user to be alerted on their phone when a release has an
    issue, and ask Switch to kill the release immediately, without needing to
    return to a computer.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Easy Tech Debt Collection:</strong> Identifying and resolving obsolete
    code with a quick and simple request to Switch.&nbsp;
  </li>
</ul>
