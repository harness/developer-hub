The environment-level audit log lists all changes made to feature flags within an environment. It’s similar to the Audit log tab found in each feature flag; however, it allows you to see all changes without visiting each feature flag separately. It also supports sophisticated filtering, for example, whether a feature flag has had traffic in the last seven days, hasn’t been modified in more than 30 days, etc.

View these changes in the Audit log tab of the Environments dashboard. Changes to each feature flag are logged, regardless of whether the change is made by a user or using the API.
