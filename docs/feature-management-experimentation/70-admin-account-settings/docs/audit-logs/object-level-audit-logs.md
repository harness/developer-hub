Changes to individual objects within Split such as a feature flag, segment, or metric are logged, regardless of whether the change is made by a user, an API call, or an integration.

Object-level changes are viewed in the Audit log tab of the object that was changed. Changes are also viewed across all feature flags changed within an environment in the Audit log tab of the Environments dashboard. Refer to the [Audit logs](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360020579472-Audit-logsguide) for more information. Also refer to the [Admin audit logs](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360051392872-Admin-audit-logs) guide.
