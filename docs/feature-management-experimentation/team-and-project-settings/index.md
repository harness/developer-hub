## Overview

The team settings in Harness FME provides access to key tools for managing your feature flags, segments, and workflows. 

## My work

View all items assigned to you, including feature flags, rollout tasks, and any approvals that need your attention.

## Statuses

Configure and manage custom statuses that define the lifecycle of feature flags and related items.

## Rollout board

Track feature flag rollouts at a glance. Use the board to monitor progress, visualize changes, and quickly assess the current state of rollouts across your projects.

## Owners (legacy)

Manage account-level ownership settings. This page is a legacy configuration and may not be available in all accounts.

### Why canâ€™t segment owners edit or add items?

In FME, segment ownership is different from feature flag ownership. Segment owners can view and manage the segment itself but cannot add new items or edit unrelated feature flags or projects. This separation ensures that only users with the appropriate project or environment permissions can make broader changes.
