## Question

How do I find out what changed when Harness releases a new version of an FME SDK?

### Answer

For information about changes in the SDK over time you can start at [GitHub](https://github.com/splitio).

Click on your clients of choice. Under CHANGES.txt, you'll find what is different and when the change was made.
