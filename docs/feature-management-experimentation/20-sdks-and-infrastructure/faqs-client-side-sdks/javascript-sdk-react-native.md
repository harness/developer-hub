## Issue

### Build environment

react: 16.3.0
react-native: 0.55.0

### Steps to reproduce

When running the bundle, following error occurrs: bundling failed: Error: Unable to resolve module `util` from `D:\\project\node_modules\@splitsoftware\splitio\lib\utils\logger\LoggerFactory.js: Module util does not exist in the Haste module map`

## Answer

JavaScript SDK requires class util as a dependency; however, it's not included in the package.json dependencies, since it comes built-in in most npm packages.

React Native, however, does not have the class "util" by default installation.

Install the class using the command below, this will fix the issue
```
npm install util
```

As of July 29th 2021, our [React Native SDK](/docs/feature-management-experimentation/sdks-and-infrastructure/client-side-sdks/react-native-sdk) is available.
