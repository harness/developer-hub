You can import the SDK into your project using NPM or our bundled option which we host through our CDN.

You can take advantage of both `slim` and `full` entry points when using NPM as you decide what to import. However, on the already bundled option, the code included is static, so we expose a different bundle for each entry point. The `slim` version includes all the key functionality of the SDK and the full one includes every available pluggable module, for example, the logger or the *InlocalStorage* module.

<!-- Choose the preferred script tag, you don't need both -->

<!-- Full build, bigger footprint but all modules are exposed and usable,
including fetch polyfill -->
