JavaScript Browser SDK is built on top of our Javascript SDK core modules but optimized for web browsers.

The library exports a `slim` (default) and a `full` entry point in UMD, CommonJS, and ES module formats, which allows you to import and use the SDK. The `slim` entry point has less features by default, resulting in a smaller footprint. At the moment, the `full` entry point only differs from the `slim` entry point by including a [Fetch API polyfill](#language-support), but more features might be added in the future.

Both entry points share the same pluggable API that you can use to include more functionality optionally and keep your bundle leaner.
