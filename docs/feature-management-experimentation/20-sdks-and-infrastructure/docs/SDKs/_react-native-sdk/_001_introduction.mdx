React Native SDK is built on top of our JavaScript SDK core modules but is optimized for React Native applications.

This SDK also has a pluggable API you can use to include more functionality optionally and keep your bundle leaner. If already using our isomorphic JavaScript SDK, consider this [migration guide](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360059966112-Browser-SDK-Migration-Guide) to understand the changes of the new pluggable API.
