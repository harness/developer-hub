The Split SDK for React Native supports both React Native bare projects (using [React-Native CLI](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)) and Expo managed projects (using [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.io/get-started/installation/)).

It has been validated with React Native v0.59 and later, and Expo v36 and later, but should also work with older versions.
