In the example below, we are rolling out a feature flag to users. The provided attributes `plan_type`, `registered_date`, `permissions`, `paying_customer`, and `deal_size` are passed to the `getTreatment` call. These attributes are compared and evaluated against the attributes used in the feature flag targeting rules (defined in the FME/Split user interface) to decide which treatment is assigned to this key.

```swift title="Swift"
var attributes: [String:Any] = [:]

attributes["plan_type"] = "growth"
attributes["registered_date"] = Date().timeIntervalSince1970
attributes["deal_size"] = 1000
attributes["paying_customer"] = true
let perms: [String] = ["read", "write"];
attributes["permissions"] = perms

// See client initialization above
let treatment = client?.getTreatment("FEATURE_FLAG_NAME", attributes: attributes)

if treatment == "on" {
    // insert code here to show on treatment
} else if treatment == "off" {
    // insert code here to show off treatment
} else {
    // insert your control treatment code here
}
```
