Each JavaScript SDK client is tied to one specific customer and traffic type at a time (for example, `user`, `account`, `organization`). This enhances performance and reduces data cached within the SDK.

Split supports the ability to release based on multiple traffic types. With traffic types, you can release to `users` in one feature flag and `accounts` in another. If you are unfamiliar with using multiple traffic types, refer to [Traffic types](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360019916311-Traffic-type) for more information.

If you need to roll out features by different traffic types, instantiate multiple SDK clients, one for each traffic type. For example, you may want to roll out the feature `user-poll` by `users` and the feature `account-permissioning` by `accounts`.
