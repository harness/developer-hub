The SDK configuration has a parameter called `impressionListener` where an implementation of `ImpressionListener` can be added. The implementation must define the `logImpression` method.

Data recieved by the impression listener:

| **Name** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| impression | Object | Impression object that has the feature, key, treatment, label, etc. |
| attributes | Object | A map of attributes passed to `getTreatment`/`getTreatments` (if any). |
| sdkLanguageVersion | String | The version of the SDK. In this case the language is { window.location.pathname.includes("Javascript%20SDK") ? "'javascript'" : "'browserjs'" } plus the version currently running. |

There are two additional keys on this object, `ip` and `hostname`. They are not used on the client side.
