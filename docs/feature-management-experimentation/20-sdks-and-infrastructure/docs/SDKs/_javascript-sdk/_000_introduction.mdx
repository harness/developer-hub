:::info[Migrating from v10.x to v11.x]
When upgrading, consider that the traffic type is no longer configured for the SDK client, and must be sent on the `client.track()` method call instead.

Refer to the [migration guide](https://github.com/splitio/javascript-client/blob/development/MIGRATION-GUIDE.md) for complete information on upgrading to v11.x.
