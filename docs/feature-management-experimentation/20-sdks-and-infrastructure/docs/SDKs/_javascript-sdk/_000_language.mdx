The JavaScript SDK supports all major browsers. While the library was built to support ES5 syntax, it depends on native support for ES6 `Promise`, `Map`, and `Set` objects, and therefore, you need to **polyfill** them if they are not available in your target browsers.

If you're looking for possible polyfill options, check [es6-promise](https://github.com/stefanpenner/es6-promise), [es6-map](https://github.com/medikoo/es6-map) and [es6-set](https://github.com/medikoo/es6-set) for Promise, Map and Set polyfills respectively.
