This library is designed for Android applications written in Java or Kotlin and is compatible with Android SDK versions 19 and later (4.4 Kit Kat).

:::warning[WorkManager v2.7.1 dependency]

Starting with `Android v3.0.0`, this SDK now relies on `WorkManager v2.7.1`. This requires your application to use at least `compileSdk 31`.

If you haven't upgraded to use API 31, you can force the downgrade of the `WorkManager` dependency.
```groovy
implementation("androidx.work:work-runtime") {
    version {
        strictly("2.6.0")
    }
}
```
