## Get treatments with configurations

To [leverage dynamic configurations with your treatments](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360026943552), use the `getTreatmentWithConfig` method. This method returns an object containing the treatment and associated configuration.

<>{props.codeTreatmentResult}</>

The config element is a stringified version of the configuration JSON defined in the FME (Split) user interface. If there is no configuration defined for a treatment, the SDK returns `null` for the config parameter.

This method takes the exact same set of arguments as the standard `getTreatment` method.

Example:

<>{props.codeTreatmentWithConfig}</>

If you need to get multiple evaluations at once, you can also use the `getTreatmentsWithConfig` methods. These methods take the exact same arguments as the [`getTreatments`](#multiple-evaluations-at-once) methods but return a mapping of feature flag names to SplitResult objects instead of strings.

Example:

<>{props.codeTreatmentsWithConfig}</>
