This guide provides detailed information about our {props.sdkName} SDK. All of our SDKs are open source. Go to our <a href="{props.repo}">{props.sdkName} GitHub repository</a> to see the source code.

## Create a Harness Account {#create-a-harness-account}

To work with the SDK, you will need a Harness account. If you don't yet have an account, you can [get one for free](https://app.harness.io/auth/#/signup?utm_source=harness_hdh_fme).

You could skip this for now, but you will soon need to create a {props.sdkKeyType} SDK key and some FME feature flags in Harness. Once these are created, you will be able to use the SDK to evaluate your flags and alter your code execution path based on the feature flag evaluations.

## Initialization {#initialization}

To get started, set up Harness FME in your codebase with the following two steps.

### 1. Import the SDK into your project

### 2. Instantiate the SDK and create a new SDK client

Configure the SDK with the {props.sdkKeyType} SDK key for the Split environment that you would like to access.

:::tip[Use the singleton pattern]
We recommend instantiating the SDK factory once as a singleton and reusing it throughout your application.
:::

When the SDK is instantiated, it starts background tasks to update an in-memory cache with small amounts of data fetched from Harness servers. This process may take up to a few hundred milliseconds depending on the size of the data. 

If the SDK is asked to evaluate a feature flag while it is still updating its cache, it may not have the data necessary to run the evaluation. In this case, the SDK does not fail. Instead, it returns [the control treatment](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360020528072-Control-treatment).

After the first initialization, the fetched data is stored. Further initializations fetch data from that cache and the configuration is immediately available.
