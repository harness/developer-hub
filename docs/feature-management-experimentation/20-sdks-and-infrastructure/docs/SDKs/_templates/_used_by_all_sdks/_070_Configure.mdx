## Configuration {#configuration}

The SDK exposes configuration parameters that you can use to optimize SDK performance. Each parameter is preset to a reasonable default. You can optionally override these default values when instantiating the SDK.

| **Configuration** | **Description** | **Default value** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| core.labelsEnabled | Enable impression labels from being sent to Split cloud. Labels may contain sensitive information. | true |
| startup.readyTimeout | Maximum amount of time in seconds to wait before firing the `SDK_READY_TIMED_OUT` event | 10 |
| startup.requestTimeoutBeforeReady | The SDK has two main endpoints it uses /splitChanges and /mySegments that it hits to get ready. This config sets how long (in seconds) the SDK will wait for each request it makes as part of getting ready. | 5 |
| startup.retriesOnFailureBeforeReady | How many retries on /splitChanges and /mySegments we will do while getting the SDK ready | 1 |
| startup.eventsFirstPushWindow | Use to set a specific timer (expressed in seconds) for the first push of events, starting on SDK initialization. | 10 |
| scheduler.featuresRefreshRate | The SDK polls Split servers for changes to feature rollout plans. This parameter controls this polling period in seconds. | 60 |
| scheduler.segmentsRefreshRate | The SDK polls Split servers for changes to segment definitions. This parameter controls this polling period in seconds. | 60 |
| scheduler.impressionsRefreshRate | The SDK sends information on who got what treatment at what time back to Split servers to power analytics. This parameter controls how often this data is sent to Split servers. The parameter should be in seconds. | 300 |
| scheduler.impressionsQueueSize | The max amount of impressions we queue. If the queue is full, the SDK flushes the impressions and resets the timer. | 30000 |
| scheduler.eventsPushRate | The SDK sends tracked events to Split servers. This setting controls that flushing rate in seconds. | 60 |
| scheduler.eventsQueueSize | The max amount of events we queue. If the queue is full, the SDK flushes the events and resets the timer. | 500 |
| scheduler.telemetryRefreshRate | The SDK caches diagnostic data that it periodically sends to Split servers. This configuration controls how frequently this data is sent back to Split servers (in seconds). | 3600 seconds (1 hour) |
| sync.splitFilters | Filter specific feature flags to be synced and evaluated by the SDK. This is formed by a type string property and a list of string values for the given criteria. Using the types 'bySet' (recommended, flag sets are available in all tiers) or 'byName', pass an array of strings defining the query. If empty or unset, all feature flags are downloaded by the SDK. | [] |
| sync.impressionsMode | This configuration defines how impressions (decisioning events) are queued on the SDK. Supported modes are OPTIMIZED, NONE, and DEBUG. In OPTIMIZED mode, only unique impressions are queued and posted to Split; this is the recommended mode for experimentation use cases. In NONE mode, no impression is tracked in Split and only minimum viable data to support usage stats is, so never use this mode if you are experimenting with that instance impressions. Use NONE when you want to optimize for feature flagging only use cases and reduce impressions network and storage load. In DEBUG mode, ALL impressions are queued and sent to Split; this is useful for validations. This mode doesn't impact the impression listener which receives all generated impressions locally. | `OPTIMIZED` |
| sync.enabled | Controls the SDK continuous synchronization flags. When `true`, a running SDK processes rollout plan updates performed in the Split user interface (default). When `false`, it fetches all data upon init, which ensures a consistent experience during a user session and optimizes resources when these updates are not consumed by the app. | true |
| sync.requestOptions.getHeaderOverrides | A callback function that can be used to override the Authentication header or append new headers to the SDK's HTTP(S) requests. | undefined |
| storage | Pluggable storage instance to be used by the SDK as a complement to in memory storage. Only supported option today is `InLocalStorage`. Read more [here](#configuring-localstorage-cache-for-the-sdk). | In memory storage |
| debug | Either a boolean flag, string log level or logger instance for activating SDK logs. See [logging](#logging) for details. | false |
| streamingEnabled | Boolean flag to enable the streaming service as default synchronization mechanism. In the event of an issue with streaming, the SDK will fallback to the polling mechanism. If false, the SDK will poll for changes as usual without attempting to use streaming. | true |
| userConsent | User consent status used to control the tracking of events and impressions. Possible values are `GRANTED`, `DECLINED`, and `UNKNOWN`. See [User consent](#user-consent) for details. | `GRANTED` |
