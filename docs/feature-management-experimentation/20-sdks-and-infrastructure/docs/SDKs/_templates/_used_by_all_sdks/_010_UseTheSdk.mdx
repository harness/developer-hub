## Use the SDK

### Basic Use {#basic-use}

To make sure the SDK is fully instantiated before evaluating a feature flag, you should block until the SDK is ready, as shown below. We set the client to listen for the `SDK_READY` event triggered by the SDK before asking for an evaluation.

After the `SDK_READY` event fires, you can use the `getTreatment` method to evaluate the feature flag. (The `getTreatment` method returns the feature flag **treatment** variation that is evaluated for the given user ID.)

You can use an `if ... else` block as shown below and insert the code for the different treatments that you defined in the Split user interface. Remember to let the final `else` branch in your code handle the feature flag's `"CONTROL"` treatment.
