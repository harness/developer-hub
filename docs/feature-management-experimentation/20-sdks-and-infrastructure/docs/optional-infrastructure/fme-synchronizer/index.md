By default, Split’s SDKs keep segment and feature flag data synchronized as users navigate across disparate systems, treatments, and conditions. However, some languages, do not have a native capability to keep a shared local cache of this data to properly serve treatments. For these cases, we built the Split Synchronizer service.

This tool coordinates the sending and receiving of data to a remote datastore that all of your processes can share to pull data for the evaluation of treatments. Out of the box, Split supports Redis as a remote datastore, and so the Split Synchronizer uses Redis as the cache for your SDKs when evaluating treatments. It also posts impression and event data and metrics generated by the SDKs back to Split’s servers, for exposure in the user interface or sending to the data integration of your choice. The Synchronizer service runs as a standalone process in dedicated or shared servers and it does not affect the performance of your code, or Split’s SDKs.

:::info[Split Synchronizer version 5.0 available!]
Since version 5.0.0 of the split-synchronizer, there's only one operation mode. What was once `proxy mode` is now a separate tool called [**Split proxy**](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/4415960499213-Split-Proxy). This version includes a more performant way to evict impressions & events from redis that allows customers to handle much greater volumes of data, while protecting your flags from being evicted if the redis instance runs low on memory.

Currently, the SDKs supported by this versions are:
Ruby 6.0.0
PHP 6.0.0
Node.js 10.6.0
Go 3.0.0
Python 7.0.0
.NET 4.0.0
Java 4.4.0
:::

:::warning
If you are upgrading from Split synchronizer version 4.x or below to 5.x, some of the configuration and environment parameter names have been changed. Refer to the Configuration section and modify the parameters names accordingly.

## Overall Architecture

**The service performs five actions:**

* **Fetch feature flags:** Retrieve the feature flag definitions.
* **Fetch segments:** Retrieve your set segments lists.
* **Post impressions:** Send to Split servers the generated impressions by the SDK.
* **Post telemetry:** Send to Split servers different metrics of the SDK, such as latencies.
* **Post events:** Send to Split servers the generated events by the SDK `.track` method.

:::info[Split-Sync v5.0.0 pipelined data eviction]
Starting with split-sync v5.0.0, we've introduced a new approach to impressions and events eviction. This replaces the previous approach of periodically fetching & posting impressions and events. Our new approch feature flags this task in 3 parts, a thread dedicated to fetching data from redis and placing it in a buffer, N threads (where N is derived from the number of available CPU cores) dedicated to parsing, formatting the data and placing it in a second buffer, and N (configurable) threads that pick the data and post it to Split servers. The result is a significant increase in throughput, that will better suit customers which operate on big volumes of data.

:::info[Synchronizer mode with local redis instance]
Sometimes, when building POCs or testing the synchronizer locally, you might want to launch our docker container image, pointing to a local redis server (or another container with redis, whose port has been mapped to a local one). In such case, you should consider adding the option `--network="host"` (appending it to the command shown above) when launching the synchronizer. This will allow you to use `-e SPLIT_SYNC_REDIS_HOST="localhost"`, with the split-synchronizer container properly reaching your local redis server.
:::

:::info[Docker configuration]
The [Advanced configuration section](#advanced-configuration) includes additional Docker information in the column **Docker environment variable**.

:::warning[Redis instance]
On the samples above, Redis is running as a local service with **default host: localhost** and **default port: 6379**. For further information, see [Advanced configuration](#advanced-configuration).
:::

:::warning[Redis database]
To maximize performance and isolation, we recommend connecting to a Redis database dedicated to the Split Synchronizer. For further information, see [Advanced configuration](#advanced-configuration).
:::

:::info[Redis Sentinel support]
Split Synchronizer also supports Redis Sentinel (v2) replication. For further information about Redis Sentinel, refer to the [Sentinel Documentation](https://redis.io/topics/sentinel).
:::

:::info[Redis Cluster support]
Split Synchronizer supports Redis Cluster with Redis^3.0.0. For further information about Redis Cluster, refer to the [Cluster Documentation](https://redis.io/topics/cluster-spec).
:::

#### Recommended configuration for production

You can run the service with the simple steps above, but the system is more stable in your production environment when you run the job with a scheduling system. We recommend starting the synchronizer via [supervisord](http://supervisord.org), a daemon that launches other processes and ensures they stay running.

To use supervisord, make sure that it is installed on your machine. You can get help on the installation at the [official Supervisord documentation](http://supervisord.org/installing.html).

When supervisord is installed into your project, copy and paste the program below anywhere into the `supervisord.conf` file that should now be in your project.

```ini title="supervisord configuration file (sample)
[program:splitio_sync]
command=/usr/local/bin/split-sync -config /path/to/your/config.file.json
process_name = SplitIO
numprocs = 1
autostart=true
autorestart=true
user = your_user
stderr_logfile=/var/log/splitio.err.log
stderr_logfile_maxbytes = 1MB
stdout_logfile=/var/log/splitio.out.log
stdout_logfile_maxbytes = 1MB
``` 

## Advanced configuration

The Synchronizer service has a number of knobs for configuring performance. Each knob is tuned to a reasonable default, however, you can override the default values by changing a `splitio.config.json` file or by setting your customer values as parameters of `-config` in the command line option. In this section, we lay out all the different knobs you can configure for performance, Redis, and logging.

The `splitio.config.json` file provided via the `-config` option lets you control how often the synchronizer fetches data from Split servers. You can create a sample JSON file automatically with default values by running this command.

```bash
./split-sync -write-default-config "/home/someuser/splitio.config.json"
```

:::info[Configuration path file]
Save the JSON config file on your server in your desired folder. For instance, on Linux systems, it could be saved in the `etc` folder.
Remember to set the right path as the `-config` parameter.

### Methods to configure the Split synchronizer

You can configure the Split synchronizer service using the command line or by directly editing the above mentioned **JSON** configuration file. 

:::info[Config values priority]
All config values are set with a default value that you can see in the example **JSON** file above. You can overwrite the default value from the JSON config file, and you can overwrite the JSON config file from the command line. See a sample below for how to do that via command line.

```

### CLI Configuration options and its equivalents in JSON & Environment variables

:::warning[Split Synchronizer version 5.0 boolean options change]
In order to reduce the issues because of typos and confusion due to "multiple words & case meaning the same", since version 5.0.0 of the split-synchronizer, the only accepted values for boolean flags are "true" & "false" in lowercase. Things like "enabled", "on", "yes", "tRue" will result in an error at startup. This applies to JSON, CLI arguments & environment variables.

## Listener

The Split Synchronizer provides an impression listener that bulks post impressions to a user-defined HTTP endpoint.

The endpoint should expect a POST request, containing a JSON body with the following format.

```json title="JSON Impression"
{
 "impressions": [
  {
   "testName": "feature1",
   "keyImpressions": [
    {
     "keyName": "user1",
     "treatment": "on",
     "time": 1502754901182,
     "changeNumber": -1,
     "label": ""
    },
    {
     "keyName": "user2",
     "treatment": "off",
     "time": 1502754876144,
     "changeNumber": -1,
     "label": ""
    }
   ]
  }
 ],
 "sdkVersion": "php-5.2.2",
 "machineIP": "208.63.222.7",
 "MachineName": ""
}
```

Currently, the configuration options are available in the `integrations.impressionListener` section of the JSON configuration file detailed in [Advanced configuration](#advanced-configuration).

## Using a network proxy

If you need to use a network proxy, configure proxies by setting the environment variables **HTTP_PROXY** and **HTTPS_PROXY**. The internal HTTP client reads those variables and uses them to perform the server request.

```bash title="Example: Environment variables"
$ export HTTP_PROXY="http://10.10.1.10:3128"
$ export HTTPS_PROXY="http://10.10.1.10:1080"
```

## Admin tools

### Endpoints

The `split-sync` service has a set of endpoints and a dashboard to let DevOps and infra team monitor its status and cached data in real-time. By default the port is `3010` and for security reason supports HTTP Basic Authentication configured by the user.

**/info/ping**

A ping endpoint to monitor the service status. If the service is running, it sends the text response `pong` and the HTTP status code `200`.

**/info/version**

Returns the `split-sync` version in JSON format.

```json
{
  "version" : "1.1.0"
}
```

**/info/uptime**

Returns the uptime string representation in JSON format.

```json
{
  "uptime" : "5d 3h 36m 39s"
}
```

### Admin Dashboard

Split-sync has a web admin UI out of the box that exposes all available endpoints. Browse to `/admin/dashboard` to see it.

<p>
  <img src="https://help.split.io/hc/article_attachments/31811643591693" alt="split_synchronizer_dashboard_main.png" />
</p>

<p>
  <img src="https://help.split.io/hc/article_attachments/31811626953101" alt="split_synchronizer_dashboard_stats.png" />
</p>

The dashboard is organized in four sections for ease of visualization:

* **Dashboard:** Tile-sorted summary information, including these metrics:
    - *Uptime:* Uptime metric
    - *Healthy Since:* Time passed without errors
    - *Logged Errors:* Total count of error messages
    - *SDKs Total Hits:* Total SDKs requests
    - *Backend Total Hits:* Total backend requests between split-sync and Split servers
    - *Cached Feature flags:* Number of feature flags cached in memory
    - *Cached Segments:* Number of segments cached in memory
    - *Impressions Queue Size*: shows the total amount of Impressions stored in Redis (only Producer Mode).
    - *Impressions Lambda*: shows the eviction rate for Impressions (only Producer Mode).
    - *Events Queue Size*: shows the total amount of Events stored in Redis (only Producer Mode).
    - *Events Lambda*: shows the eviction rate for Events (only Producer Mode).
    - *SDK Server*: displays the status of Split server for SDK.
    - *Events Server*: displays the status of Split server for Events.
    - Streaming Server*: displays the status of Split streaming service
    - Auth Server*: displays the status of Split server for initial streaming authentication
    - Telemetry Server*: displays the status of Split server for telemetry capturing.
    - *Storage*: (only Sync mode) displays the status of the storage.
    - *Sync*: displays the status of the Synchronizer.
    - *Last Errors Log:* List of the last 10 error messages
* **SDK stats:** Metrics numbers and a latency graph, measured between SDKs requests integration and proxy.
* **Data inspector:** Cached data showing feature flags and segments; filters to find keys and feature flag definitions.
* **Queue Manager:** expose sizes of Impressions and Events queues.

:::warning[Dashboard refresh rate]
The dashboard numbers are committed every 60 seconds. The `Logged Errors`, `Last Errors Log` tiles, and the `Data inspector` section are populated each time the dashboard is refreshed.
For Impressions and Events Queue size the numbers are refreshed every 10 seconds.
:::

### Service shutdown

The `split-sync` service can catch a `kill sig` command and start a graceful shutdown, flushing all cached data progressively. Additionally, you can perform `graceful stop` and `force stop (kill -9)` with one click from the admin dashboard.

<p>

</p>

If you have configured a Slack channel and the Slack Webhook URL, an alert is sent to the channel when and initialization or shutdown is performed.
