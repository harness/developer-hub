Call the `.destroy` method before letting a process using the SDK exit, as this method gracefully shuts down the Split SDK by stopping all background threads, clearing caches, closing connections, and flushing the remaining unpublished impressions.

```ruby title="Ruby"
client.destroy
```

**Note: Within multi-threaded setups like using Ruby with Rails and Puma, to fully destroy the factory, you need to set it to nil as follows: `Rails.configuration.split_factory = nil`**

:::warning[Important!]
A call to the `destroy()` method also destroys the factory object. When creating new client instance, first create a new factory instance.
