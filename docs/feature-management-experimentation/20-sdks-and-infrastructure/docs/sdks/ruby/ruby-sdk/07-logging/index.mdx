Our Ruby SDK makes use of Rubyâ€™s stdlib `Logger` class to log errors/events. The default option is shown below:

```ruby title="Ruby"
Logger.new($stdout)
```

You can configure the following options in the config file.

```ruby title="Ruby"
{
  # ...
  # you can specify your own Logger class instance here:
  logger: Logger.new('logfile.log'),
  # to enable more verbose logging, including more debug information (false is the default) use:
  debug_enabled: true,
  # to log transport data (mostly http requests, false is the default) use:
  transport_debug_enabled: true
  # ...
}
```
