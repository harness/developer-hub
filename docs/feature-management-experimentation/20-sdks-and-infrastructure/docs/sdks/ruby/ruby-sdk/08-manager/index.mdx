Use the Split Manager to get a list of feature flags available to the split client.

To instantiate a Manager in your code base, use the same factory that you used for your client.

```python title="Manager"
split = factory.client()
manager = factory.manager()
```

The Manager then has the following methods available.

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

<Tabs
  values={[
    {label: 'Multi-threaded', value: 'multi'},
    {label: 'asyncio', value: 'asyncio'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="multi">
```python
class SplitManager(object):
    def split_names(self):
        """Returns the names of feature flags registered with the SDK. Subclasses need to override this method.
        :return: A list of str
        :rtype: list

        def splits(self):
        """Retrieves the feature flags that are currently registered with the SDK. Subclasses need to override this method.
        :return: A List of SplitView.
        :rtype: list

        raise NotImplementedError()

    def split(self, feature_flag_name):
        """Returns the Feature Flag registered with the SDK of this name. Subclasses need to override this method.
        :return: The SplitView instance.
        :rtype: SplitView

        raise NotImplementedError()
```

The `SplitView` object that you see referenced above has the following structure.

```python title="SplitView"
SplitView = namedtuple('SplitView', ['name', 'traffic_type', 'killed', 'treatments', 'change_number', 'configs', 'default_treatment', 'sets', 'impressions_disabled'])
```
