Use the Split Manager to get a list of feature flags available to the Split client. To instantiate a Manager in your code base, use the same factory that you used for your client.

```ruby
# Reusing the split_factory created originally.
split_manager = split_factory.manager
```

The `Manager` object referenced above has the following methods.

```ruby
# returns a List of SplitViews or empty.
list_of_feature_flags = split_manager.splits

# Array of String representing feature flag names
list_of_feature_flag_names = split_manager.split_names

# returns a SplitView of the 'name' specified or empty.
feature_flag = split_manager.split(name)
```

The `feature_flag` object referenced above has the following structure.

```ruby title="Feature flags by Split Manager"
{
 :name=>"new_reporting",
 :traffic_type_name=>"user",
 :killed=>false,
 :treatments=>["v1", "v2", "v3"],
