// Event without a value
let resp = client?.track(trafficType: "TRAFFIC_TYPE", eventType: "EVENT-TYPE")
// Example
let resp = client?.track(trafficType: "user", eventType: "page_load_time")

// If you would like to associate a value to an event
let resp = client?.track(trafficType: "TRAFFIC_TYPE", eventType: "EVENT-TYPE", value: VALUE)
// Example
let resp = client?.track(trafficType: "user", eventType: "page_load_time", value: 83.334)

// If you would like to associate just properties to an event
let resp = client?.track(trafficType: "TRAFFIC_TYPE", eventType: "EVENT-TYPE", properties: PROPERTIES)
// Example
let properties: [String:Any] = ["package": "premium", "discount": 50, "admin": true]
