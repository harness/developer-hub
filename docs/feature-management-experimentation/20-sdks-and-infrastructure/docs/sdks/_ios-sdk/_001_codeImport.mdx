### Swift Package Manager

You can import the SDK in your project by using Swift Package Manager. This can be done through XCode or by editing manually the **Package.swift** file to add the iOS SDK repository as a dependency.

### CocoaPods

You can also import the SDK into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, adding it in your **Podfile**.

``` title="Podfile"
pod 'Split', '~> 3.1.1'
```

### Carthage

This is another option to import the SDK. Just add it in your **Cartfile**.


``` title="Cartfile"
github "splitio/ios-client" 3.1.1
```

Once added, follow the steps provided in the [Carthage Readme](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/blob/master/README.md#if-youre-building-for-ios-tvos-or-watchos).
