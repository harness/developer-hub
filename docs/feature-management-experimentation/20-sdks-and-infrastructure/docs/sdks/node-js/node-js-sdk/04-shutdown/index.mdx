Call the `client.destroy()` method before letting a process using the SDK exit, as this method gracefully shuts down the Split SDK by stopping all background threads, clearing caches, closing connections, and flushing the remaining unpublished impressions. 

```javascript title="JavaScript"
user_client.destroy();
user_client = null;
```

After `destroy()` is called and finishes, any subsequent invocations to `getTreatment`/`getTreatments` or manager methods result in `control` or empty list, respectively.

:::warning[Important!]
A call to the `Destroy()` method also destroys the factory object. When creating new client instance, first create a new factory instance.
