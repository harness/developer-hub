## Question

How do I find out what changed when Split releases a new version of the SDK?

## Answer

For information about changes in the SDK over time you can start at [GitHub](https://github.com/splitio).

Click on a SDK client repository. The `CHANGES.txt` file, is the version change log for the SDK. You'll find what is different and when the change was made.
