The Split React SDK requires React 16.8.0 or above, since it uses **React Hooks API** introduced in that version.

The SDK supports all major web browsers. It was built to support ES5 syntax but it depends on native support for ES6 `Promise`, `Map`, and `Set` objects, so these objects need to be **polyfilled** if they are not available in your target browsers, like IE 11.

If you're looking for possible polyfill options, check [es6-promise](https://github.com/stefanpenner/es6-promise), [es6-map](https://github.com/medikoo/es6-map) and [es6-set](https://github.com/medikoo/es6-set) for `Promise`, `Map` and `Set` polyfills respectively.
