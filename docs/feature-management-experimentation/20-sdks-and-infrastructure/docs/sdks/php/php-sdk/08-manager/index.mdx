Use the Split Manager to get a list of feature flags available to the Split client.

To instantiate a Manager in your code base, use the same factory that you used for your client.

```php title="Manager"
<?php
 
$splitFactory = \SplitIO\Sdk::factory('YOUR_SDK_KEY', $options);
$splitManager = $splitFactory->manager();
```

The Manager then has the following methods available.

```php title="PHP"
<?php
namespace SplitIO\Sdk\Manager;
 
interface SplitManagerInterface
{
    /**
     * Retrieves the feature flags that are currently registered with the
     * SDK.
     *
     * @return array of \SplitIO\Sdk\Manager\SplitView
     */
    public function splits();
 
    /**
     * Returns the feature flags registered with the SDK of this name.
     *
     * @param $featureFlagName
     * @return \SplitIO\Sdk\Manager\SplitView
     */
    public function split($featureFlagName);
}
```

The `SplitView` object referenced above has the following structure.

```php title="PHP"
<?php
namespace SplitIO\Sdk\Manager;
 
class SplitView
{
    private $name;
    private $trafficType; // the name of the traffic type
    private $killed;
    private $treatments;
    private $changeNumber;
    private $configs;
  
  // Getter and Setter methods have been omitted
}
