With the SDK architecture, there is a set of options that you can configure to get everything connected and working as expected.

| **Option** | **Description** | 
| --- | --- | 
| transfer | IPC socket parameters (type, address, timeouts) | 
| logging | Logging parameters |
| utils | Instance of an impression listener to send impression data to a custom location |

```php title="PHP"
<?php
 
$sdkConfig = [
   'transfer' => ['address' => '/var/run/splitd.sock'],
   'logging' => ['psr-instance' => $myLogger],
];
 
$splitFactory = \SplitIO\ThinSdk\Factory::withConfig($sdkConfig);
$splitClient = $splitFactory->client();
```

### Impressions data

By default, the SDK sends small amounts of information to the Split backend indicating the reason for each treatment returned from a feature flag. An example would be that a user saw the `on` treatment because they are `in segment all`.
