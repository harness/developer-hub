Use these methods on Splitio instance to get a list of the feature flags available to the Split client.

```dart title="Flutter"

/// Retrieves the feature flags that are currently registered with the SDK.
Future<List<SplitView>> splits();

/// Returns the feature flags registered with the SDK of this name.
Future<SplitView?> split(String splitName);

/// Returns the names of feature flags registered with the SDK.
Future<List<String>> splitNames();
```

The `SplitView` class referenced above has the following structure:

```dart title="Flutter"
class SplitView {
  String name;
  String trafficType;
  bool killed = false;
  List<String> treatments = [];
  int changeNumber;
  Map<String, String> configs = {};
  List<String> sets = [];
  String defaultTreatment;
}
```
