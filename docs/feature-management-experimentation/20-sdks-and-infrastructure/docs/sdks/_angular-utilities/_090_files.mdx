As shown above, you define the feature flags you want to use in the `features` object map. All `getTreatment` calls for a feature flag now only return the one treatment (and config, if defined) that you have defined in the map.

Note that you can define in the `features` object a feature flag name and its treatment directly or use a map to define both a treatment and a dynamic configuration.

If you define just a string as the value for a feature flag name, any config returned by our SDKs are always null. If you use a map, we return the specified treatment and the specified config (which can also be null).

Any feature that is not provided in the `features` object returns the [control treatment](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360020528072-Control-treatment) if the SDK was asked to evaluate them.

You can use the additional configuration parameters below when instantiating the SDK in localhost mode.

| **Configuration** | **Description** | **Default value** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| scheduler.offlineRefreshRate | The refresh interval for the mocked features treatments. | 15 |
| features | A fixed mapping of which treatment to show for our mocked features. | \{\} <br />By default we have no mocked features. |

You can then change the feature flags as necessary for your testing, by mutating the properties of the `features` object you've provided. The SDK simulates polling for changes every `offlineRefreshRate` seconds, and will emit an `SDK_UPDATE` event if the mocked features have changed.
