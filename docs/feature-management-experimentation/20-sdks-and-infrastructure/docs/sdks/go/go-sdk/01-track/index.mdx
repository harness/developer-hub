description: Track metric events to ensure the safety of your rollouts or run experiments.

Use the `track` method to record any actions your customers perform. Each action is known as an `event` and corresponds to an `event type`. Calling `track` through one of our SDKs or via the API is the first step to getting experimentation data into Split and allows you to measure the impact of your feature flags on your usersâ€™ actions and metrics.

[Learn more](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360020585772) about using track events in feature flags. 

In the examples below, you can see that the `Track()` method can take up to five arguments. The proper data type and syntax for each are:

* **key:** The `key` variable used in the `Treatment` call and firing this track event. The expected data type is **String**.
* **TRAFFIC_TYPE:** The traffic type of the key in the track call. The expected data type is **String**. You can only pass values that match the names of [traffic types](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360019916311-Traffic-type) that you have defined in your instance of Split.
* **EVENT_TYPE:** The event type that this event should correspond to. The expected data type is **String**. Full requirements on this argument are:
     * Contains 63 characters or fewer.
     * Starts with a letter or number.
     * Contains only letters, numbers, hyphen, underscore, or period. 
     * This is the regular expression we use to validate the value: `[a-zA-Z0-9][-_\.a-zA-Z0-9]{0,62}`
* **VALUE:** (Optional) The value to be used in creating the metric. This field can be sent in as null or 0 if you intend to purely use the count function when creating a metric. The expected data type is **Integer** or **Float**. 
* **PROPERTIES:** (Optional) A Map of key value pairs that can be used to filter your metrics. Learn more about event property capture in the [Events](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360020585772-Events#event-properties) guide. Split currently supports three types of properties: strings, numbers, and booleans.

:::warning[Redis Support]
If you are using our SDK with Redis, you need Split synchronizer **2.3.0** version at least in order to support *properties* in the `track` method.

```go title="Go"
// If you would like to send an event without a value 
err = splitClient.Track("key", "TRAFFIC_TYPE", "EVENT_TYPE");
// Example
err = splitClient.Track("john@doe.com", "user", "page_load_time"); 

// If you would like to associate a value to an event
err = splitClient.Track("key", "TRAFFIC_TYPE", "EVENT_TYPE", VALUE);
// Example  
err= splitClient.Track("john@doe.com", "user", "page_load_time", 83.334)

// If you would like to associate just properties to an event
err = splitClient.Track("key", "TRAFFIC_TYPE", "EVENT_TYPE", nil, {PROPERTIES})

// If you would like to associate a value and properties to an event
err = splitClient.Track("key", "TRAFFIC_TYPE", "EVENT_TYPE", VALUE, {PROPERTIES})
// Example
properties := make(map[string]interface{})
properties["package"] = "premium"
properties["admin"] = true
properties["discount"] = 50

err = splitClient.Track("key", "TRAFFIC_TYPE", "EVENT_TYPE", 83.334, properties)
