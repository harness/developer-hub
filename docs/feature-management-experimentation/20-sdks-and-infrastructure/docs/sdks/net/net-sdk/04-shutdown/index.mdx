Call the `.Destroy()` method before letting a process using the SDK exit, as this method gracefully shuts down the Split SDK by stopping all background threads, clearing caches, closing connections, and flushing the remaining unpublished impressions.

If a manual shutdown is required, call the `client.Destroy()` method.

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

<Tabs
  values={[
    {label: 'Destroy', value: 'destroy'},
    {label: 'DestroyAsync', value: 'destroyasync'}
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="destroy">
```csharp
client.Destroy();
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="destroyasync">
```csharp
await client.DestroyAsync();
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::warning[Important!]
A call to the `Destroy()` method also destroys the factory object. When creating new client instance, first create a new factory instance.
