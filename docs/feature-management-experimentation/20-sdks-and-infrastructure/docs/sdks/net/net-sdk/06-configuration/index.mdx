description: Optimize SDK performance in your environment by fine-tuning SDK config settings.
---

The SDK exposes configuration parameters that you can use to optimize SDK performance. Each parameter is preset to a reasonable default. You can optionally override these default values when instantiating the SDK.

| **Configuration** | **Description** | **Default value** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| FeaturesRefreshRate | The SDK polls Split servers for changes to feature flags at this rate (in seconds). | 5 seconds |
| SegmentsRefreshRate | The SDK polls Split servers for changes to segments at this rate (in seconds). | 60 seconds |
| ImpressionsRefreshRate | The treatment log captures which customer saw what treatment (on, off, etc) at what time. This log is periodically flushed back to Split servers. This configuration controls how quickly the cache expires after a write (in seconds). | 30 seconds |
| TelemetryRefreshRate | The SDK caches diagnostic data that it periodically sends to Split servers. This configuration controls how frequently this data is sent back to Split servers (in seconds). | 3600 seconds |
| ConnectionTimeout | HTTP client connection timeout (in ms). | 15000ms |
| ReadTimeout | HTTP socket read timeout (in ms). | 15000ms |
| LabelsEnabled | Enable/disable labels from being sent to the Split backend. Labels may contain sensitive information. | true |
| EventsFirstPushWindow | The SDK collects the events generated by the customer. This setting controls the number of seconds to wait for sending the events to the Split servers (in seconds) after the SDK is built. | 10 seconds |
| EventsPushRate | The SDK collects the events generated by the customer. This setting controls how frequently the events are sent to the Split servers (in seconds) after the first push. | 60 seconds |
| EventsQueueSize | The SDK collects the events generated by the customer. This setting controls how many events are stored locally before sending them to the Split servers (for standalone mode only). | 500 |
| IPAddressesEnabled | Disable machine IP and Hostname from being sent to Split backend. IP and Hostname may contain sensitive information. | true |
| StreamingEnabled | Boolean flag to enable the streaming service as default synchronization mechanism. In the event of an issue with streaming, the SDK will fallback to the polling mechanism. If false, the SDK will poll for changes as usual without attempting to use streaming. | true |
| ImpressionsMode | Defines how impressions are queued on the SDK. Supported modes are OPTIMIZED, NONE, and DEBUG.  In OPTIMIZED mode, only unique impressions are queued and posted to Split; this is the recommended mode for experimentation use cases. In NONE mode, no impression is tracked in Split and only minimum viable data to support usage stats is, so never use this mode if you are experimenting with that instance impressions. Use NONE when you want to optimize for feature flagging only use cases and reduce impressions network and storage load. In DEBUG mode, all impressions are queued and sent to Split; this is useful for validations. Use DEBUG mode when you want every impression to be logged in Split user interface when trying to debug your SDK setup.  This setting does not impact the impression listener which receives all generated impressions locally. | Optimized |
| ProxyHost | The name of the proxy host. | string.empty |
| ProxyPort | The port number on Host to use. | 0 (not set) |
| FlagSetsFilter | This setting allows the SDK to only synchronize the feature flags in the specified flag sets, avoiding unused or unwanted flags from being synced on the SDK instance, bringing all the benefits from a reduced payload. | null |

To set each of the parameters above, use the following syntax:

```csharp title="C#"
var config = new ConfigurationOptions
{
    ReadTimeout = 15000,
    ConnectionTimeout = 15000,
    FlagSetsFilter = new List<string> { "backend", "server_side" }
};

var factory = new SplitFactory("YOUR_SDK_KEY", config);
var sdk = factory.Client();

try
{
    sdk.BlockUntilReady(10000);
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    // log & handle
}
```
