description: Track metric events to ensure the safety of your rollouts or run experiments.

Tracking **events** is the first step to getting experimentation data into Split and allows you to measure the impact of your feature flags on your users' actions and metrics. See the [Events](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360020585772) documentation for more information.

The Suite automatically collects some RUM metrics and sends them to Split. Specifically, some [Performance API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance_API) events (see [Default events](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360030898431-Browser-RUM-agent#default-events)) and Web Vitals events are automatically collected by the Suite. Learn more about these and other events in the [Browser RUM Agent](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360030898431-Browser-RUM-agent#events) documentation.

To track custom events, you can use the Suite client's `track` method or the Suite RUM agent's `track` method. Both methods are demonstrated in the code example below.

The Suite client's `track` method sends events for the identity configured on the client instance or passed as a parameter to this method. The `track` method can take up to four arguments. The proper data type and syntax for each are:

* **TRAFFIC_TYPE:** The traffic type of the key in the track call. The expected data type is **String**. You can only pass values that match the names of [traffic types](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360019916311-Traffic-type) that you have defined in your instance of Split.
* **EVENT_TYPE:** The event type that this event should correspond to. The expected data type is **String**. Full requirements on this argument are:
     * Contains 63 characters or fewer.
     * Starts with a letter or number.
     * Contains only letters, numbers, hyphen, underscore, or period.
     * This is the regular expression we use to validate the value: `[a-zA-Z0-9][-_\.a-zA-Z0-9]{0,62}`
* **VALUE:** (Optional) The value to be used in creating the metric. This field can be sent in as null or 0 if you intend to purely use the count function when creating a metric. The expected data type is **Integer** or **Float**.
* **PROPERTIES:** (Optional) An object of key value pairs that can be used to filter your metrics. Learn more about event property capture in the [Events](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360020585772-Events#event-properties) guide. Split currently supports three types of properties: strings, numbers, and booleans.

The Suite RUM agent's `track` method sends events for all the identities configured on all instances of the Suite clients. For those clients that have not been configured with a traffic type, the `track` method uses the default traffic type `user`. The Suite RUM agent's `track` method can take up to three of the four arguments described above: `EVENT_TYPE`, `VALUE`, and `PROPERTIES`. 

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Track per identity (client's track)" value="client">

```javascript
var client = suite.client();

// The expected parameters are:
var queued = client.track('TRAFFIC_TYPE', 'EVENT_TYPE', eventValue, eventProperties);

// Example with both a value and properties
var properties = { package : "premium", admin : true, discount : 50 };
var queued = client.track('user', 'page_load_time', 83.334, properties);

// Example with only properties
var properties = { package : "premium", admin : true, discount : 50 };
var queued = client.track('user', 'page_load_time', null, properties);
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Track for all identities (RUM agent's track)" value="rum">
```javascript
var SplitRumAgent = suite.rumAgent();

// The expected parameters are:
var queued = SplitRumAgent.track('EVENT_TYPE', eventValue, eventProperties);

// Example with both a value and properties
var properties = { package : "premium", admin : true, discount : 50 };
var queued = SplitRumAgent.track('page_load_time', 83.334, properties);

// Example with only properties
var properties = { package : "premium", admin : true, discount : 50 };
var queued = SplitRumAgent.track('page_load_time', null, properties);
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The `track` methods returns a boolean value of `true` or `false` to indicate whether or not the Suite was able to successfully queue the event to be sent back to Split's servers on the next event post. The `track` method returns `false` if the current queue size is equal to the config set by `eventsQueueSize` or if incorrect input has been provided. See the [Track events](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360020585772-Track-events) documentation for more information.
