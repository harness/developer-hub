## Traffic type Attributes

Traffic type attributes are also called custom attributes. If your feature flags [target based on custom attributes](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360020793231-Target-with-custom-attributes), then you can pass attributes to the `getTreatment` method or set attributes on the {props.sdk ?? 'SDK'} client using the `AttributesManager` methods.

### Attribute syntax

The `getTreatment` method supports the following types of attributes:

<>{props.attributeTypes}</>

<>{props.codeGetTreatmentAttributes}</>

### Binding attributes to the client

Attributes can optionally be bound to the {props.sdk ?? 'SDK'} client at any time during the {props.sdk ?? 'SDK'} lifecycle. These attributes are stored in memory and used in every evaluation to avoid the need for keeping the attribute set accessible throughout the whole app.

<>{props.notesPersistentAttributesEnabled}</>

When `getTreatment` is called, the attributes provided (if any) at evaluation time are combined with the ones already loaded into the {props.sdk ?? 'SDK'} memory. The attributes passed to `getTreatment` at function execution time take precedence, allowing you to override or hide cached attributes for specific feature flag evaluations.

An attribute should be one of the following types:
- String
- Number
- Boolean
- Array

The {props.sdk ?? 'SDK'} validates attributes before storing them. If there are invalid or missing values, the methods return `false` and do not update any stored attribute value.

Example of binding attributes to the {props.sdk ?? 'SDK'} client:

<>{props.codeClientSetAttribute}</>
