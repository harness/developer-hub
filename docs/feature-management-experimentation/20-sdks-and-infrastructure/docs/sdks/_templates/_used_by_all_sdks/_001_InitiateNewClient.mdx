Configure the {props.sdk ?? 'SDK'} with the {props.sdkKeyType} {props.sdk ?? 'SDK'} key for the Split environment that you would like to access.

<>{props.sdkKeyDetails}</>

The code below shows how to instantiate the {props.sdk ?? 'SDK'}. The code creates a Split factory, which begins downloading your rollout plan (feature flag and segment definitions) so you can evaluate feature flags, and creates a client.

:::tip[Use the singleton pattern]
We recommend instantiating the {props.sdk ?? 'SDK'} factory once as a singleton and reusing it throughout your application.
:::

When the {props.sdk ?? 'SDK'} is instantiated, it starts background tasks to update an in-memory cache with small amounts of data fetched from Harness servers. This process may take up to a few hundred milliseconds depending on the size of the data. 

If the {props.sdk ?? 'SDK'} is asked to evaluate a feature flag while it is still updating its cache, it may not have the data necessary to run the evaluation. In this case, the {props.sdk ?? 'SDK'} does not fail. Instead, it returns the [`'CONTROL'` treatment](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360020528072-Control-treatment).

After the first initialization, the fetched data is stored. Further initializations fetch data from that cache and the configuration is immediately available.
