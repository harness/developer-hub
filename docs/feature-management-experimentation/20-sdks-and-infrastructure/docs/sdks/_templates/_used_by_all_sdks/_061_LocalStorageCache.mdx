## Configuring LocalStorage cache for the {props.sdk ?? 'SDK'}

To use the pluggable `InLocalStorage` option of the {props.sdk ?? 'SDK'} and be able to cache flags for subsequent loads in the same browser, you need to pass it to the {props.sdk ?? 'SDK'} config on its `storage` option.

This `InLocalStorage` function accepts an optional object with options described below:

| **Configuration** | **Description** | **Default value** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| prefix | An optional prefix for your data, to avoid collisions. | `SPLITIO` |

These pluggable caches are always available on NPM, but if using the CDN you need the full bundle. Refer to the [Import the {props.sdk ?? 'SDK'} into your project](#1-import-the-sdk-into-your-project) section for more information.
