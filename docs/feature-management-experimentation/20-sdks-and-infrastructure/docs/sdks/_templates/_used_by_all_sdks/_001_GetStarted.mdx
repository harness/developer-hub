## Create a Harness Account

To work with the {props.sdk ?? 'SDK'}, you will need a Harness account. If you don't yet have an account, you can [get one for free](https://app.harness.io/auth/#/signup?utm_source=harness_hdh_fme).

You could skip this for now, but you will soon need to create a {props.sdkKeyType} {props.sdk ?? 'SDK'} key and some FME feature flags in Harness. Once these are created, you will be able to use the {props.sdk ?? 'SDK'} to evaluate your flags and alter your code execution path based on the feature flag evaluations.
