## User consent

The {props.sdk ?? 'SDK'} allows you to disable the tracking of events and impressions until user consent is explicitly granted or declined.

The `userConsent` configuration parameter lets you set the initial consent status of the {props.sdk ?? 'SDK'} instance, and the factory method <code>{ props.method }</code> lets you grant (enable) or decline (disable) dynamic data tracking.

There are three possible initial states:
 * `'GRANTED'`: The user grants consent for tracking events and impressions. The {props.sdk ?? 'SDK'} sends them to Split cloud. This is the default value if `userConsent` param is not defined.
 * `'DECLINED'`: The user declines consent for tracking events and impressions. The {props.sdk ?? 'SDK'} does not send them to Split cloud.
 * `'UNKNOWN'`: The user neither grants nor declines consent for tracking events and impressions. The {props.sdk ?? 'SDK'} tracks them in its internal storage, and eventually either sends them or not if the consent status is updated to `'GRANTED'` or `'DECLINED'` respectively.

The status can be updated at any time with the `setUserConsent` factory method.
