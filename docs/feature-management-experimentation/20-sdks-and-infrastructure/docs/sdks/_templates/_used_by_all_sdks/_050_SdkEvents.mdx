When the {props.sdk ?? 'SDK'} retrieves (or updates the local copy of) a rollout plan (feature flag and segment definitions) from Harness servers, the {props.sdk ?? 'SDK'} will fire the following events:

* `SDK_READY_FROM_CACHE`. This event fires once the {props.sdk ?? 'SDK'} is ready to evaluate treatments using a locally cached version of your rollout plan from a previous session (which might be stale). If there is data in the cache, this event fires almost immediately, since access to the cache is fast; otherwise, it doesn't fire.
* `SDK_READY`. This event fires once the {props.sdk ?? 'SDK'} is ready to evaluate treatments using the most up-to-date version of your rollout plan, downloaded from Split servers.
* `SDK_READY_TIMED_OUT `. This event fires if there is no cached version of your rollout plan in disk cache, and the {props.sdk ?? 'SDK'} could not fully download the data from Harness servers within the time specified by the `ready` setting of the `SplitClientConfig` object. This event does not indicate that the {props.sdk ?? 'SDK'} initialization was interrupted.  The {props.sdk ?? 'SDK'} continues downloading the rollout plan and fires the `SDK_READY` event when finished.  This delayed `SDK_READY` event may happen with slow connections or large rollout plans with many feature flags, segments, or dynamic configurations.
* `SDK_UPDATE`. This event fires whenever your rollout plan is changed. Listen for this event to refresh your app whenever a feature flag or segment is changed in the FME (Split) user interface.
