### Basic Use

To make sure the {props.sdk ?? 'SDK'} is fully instantiated before evaluating a feature flag, you should block until the {props.sdk ?? 'SDK'} is ready. The client uses a handler for the `SDK_READY` event triggered by the {props.sdk ?? 'SDK'}.

<>{props.details}</>

When the {props.sdk ?? 'SDK'} is ready, you can get feature flag treatments (for a given user ID) and adjust code execution paths depending on different treatment results, as shown below. (Don't forget to handle the feature flag's `'CONTROL'` treatment.)

<div>{props.codeGetTreatment}</div>
