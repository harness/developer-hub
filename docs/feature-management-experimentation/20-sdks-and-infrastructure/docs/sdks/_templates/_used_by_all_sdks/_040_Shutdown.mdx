It is good practice to call the `destroy()` method before your app shuts down or is destroyed. This method gracefully shuts down the {props.sdk ?? 'SDK'} by stopping all background threads, clearing caches, closing connections, and flushing the remaining unpublished impressions and events.

<>{props.codeFactoryDestroy}</>

After `destroy()` is called, `client.getTreatment()` will return `"CONTROL"` and the `manager` methods will return an empty list.

:::warning[Important]
A call to the `destroy()` method also destroys the {props.sdk ?? 'SDK'} factory object. Before creating a new {props.sdk ?? 'SDK'} client instance, first create a new factory instance.
