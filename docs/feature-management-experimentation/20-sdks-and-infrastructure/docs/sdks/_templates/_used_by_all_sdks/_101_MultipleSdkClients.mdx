## Multiple SDK clients

Each SDK client is tied to one specific user ID (user key) and traffic type at a time (for example, `user`, `account`, `organization`). This enhances performance and reduces data cached within the SDK.

Split supports the ability to release features based on multiple traffic types. With traffic types, you can release to `users` in one feature flag and `accounts` in another. (Go to [Traffic types](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360019916311-Traffic-type) for more information.)

If you need to roll out features by different traffic types, instantiate multiple SDK clients, one for each traffic type.

Example of multiple SDK clients:

:::info[Number of SDK factory instances]
While the SDK does not put any limitations on the number of factory instances that can be created, we strongly recommend keeping the number instances down to **one** or **two**.
