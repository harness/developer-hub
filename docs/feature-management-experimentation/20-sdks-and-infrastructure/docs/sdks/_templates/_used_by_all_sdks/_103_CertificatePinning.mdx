## Certificate pinning

The {props.sdk ?? 'SDK'} allows you to constrain the certificates that the {props.sdk ?? 'SDK'} trusts, using one of the following techniques:

1. Pin a certificate's `SubjectPublicKeyInfo`, by providing the public key as a ___base64 SHA-256___ hash or a ___base64 SHA-1___ hash.
2. Pin a certificate's entire certificate chain (the root, all intermediate, and the leaf certificate), by providing the certificate chain as a .der file.

Each pin corresponds to a host. For subdomains, you can optionally use wildcards, where `*` will match one subdomain (e.g. `*.example.com`), and `**` will match any number of subdomains (e.g `**.example.com`).

You can optionally configure a listener to execute on certificate validation failure for a host.

To set the {props.sdk ?? 'SDK'} to require pinned certificates for specific hosts, add the `CertificatePinningConfiguration` object to `SplitClientConfig.Builder`, as shown below.
