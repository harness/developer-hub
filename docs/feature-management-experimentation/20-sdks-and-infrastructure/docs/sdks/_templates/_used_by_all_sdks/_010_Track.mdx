Use the `track` method to record any actions your end users perform. Each action is known as an `event` and corresponds to an `event type`. Calling `track` through one of our {props.sdk ?? 'SDK'}s or via the API is the first step to getting experimentation data into FME and allows you to measure the impact of your feature flags on your usersâ€™ actions and metrics. Go to [Events](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360020585772) to learn more.

In the examples below, you can see that the `track` method can take up to four arguments. The expected data type and syntax for each are:

* **TRAFFIC_TYPE:** The traffic type of the key in the track call. The expected data type is **String**. You can only pass values that match the names of [traffic types](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360019916311-Traffic-type) that you have defined in your instance of Split.
* **EVENT_TYPE:** The event type that this event should correspond to. The expected data type is **String**. Full requirements on this argument are:
    * Contains 63 characters or less.
    * Starts with a letter or number.
    * Contains only letters, numbers, hyphen, underscore, or period.
    * This is the regular expression we use to validate the value: `[a-zA-Z0-9][-_\.a-zA-Z0-9]{0,62}`
* **VALUE:** (Optional) The value to be used in creating the metric. This field can be sent in as null or 0 if you intend to purely use the count function when creating a metric. The expected data type is **Integer** or **Float**.
* **PROPERTIES:** (Optional) An object of key value pairs that can be used to filter your metrics. Learn more about event property capture in the [Events](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360020585772-Events#event-properties) guide. FME currently supports three types of properties: strings, numbers, and booleans.

The `track` method returns a boolean value of `true` or `false` to indicate whether or not the {props.sdk ?? 'SDK'} was able to successfully queue the event to be sent back to Harness's servers on the next event post. The {props.sdk ?? 'SDK'} returns `false` if the current queue size is equal to the config set by `eventsQueueSize` or if an incorrect input to the `track` method has been provided.

Go to [Track events](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360020585772-Track-events) to learn more, including expected behavior when invalid input is provided.
