## Multiple evaluations at once {#multiple-evaluations-at-once}

In some instances, you may want to evaluate treatments for multiple feature flags at once. Use the different variations of `getTreatments` method of the Split client to do this.
* `getTreatments`: Pass a list of the feature flag names you want treatments for.
* `getTreatmentsByFlagSet`: Evaluate all flags that are part of the provided flag set name and are cached on the {props.sdk ?? 'SDK'} instance.
* `getTreatmentsByFlagSets`: Evaluate all flags that are part of the provided flag set names and are cached on the {props.sdk ?? 'SDK'} instance.
