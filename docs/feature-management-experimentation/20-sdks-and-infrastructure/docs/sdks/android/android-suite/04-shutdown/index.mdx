It is good practice to call the `destroy` method before your app shuts down or is destroyed, as this method gracefully shuts down the Suite by stopping all background threads, clearing caches, closing connections, and flushing the remaining unpublished impressions.

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

<Tabs
  groupId="android-suite-lang-choice"
  values={[
    {label: 'Java', value: 'java'},
    {label: 'Kotlin', value: 'kotlin'},
  ]} defaultValue={ props.defaultTab ?? 'java' }>
  <TabItem value="java">
```java

suite.destroy();
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="kotlin">

```kotlin
suite.destroy()
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

After the `suite.destroy()` method is called and finishes, any subsequent invocations to `getTreatment` or manager methods result in `control` or an empty list, respectively. You can also call `destroy` on the client instance, which will stop the specific Suite client, but will keep the Suite running.

:::warning[Important]
The `suite.destroy()` method destroys all the Suite client instances. To create a new client instance, first create a new Suite instance.
