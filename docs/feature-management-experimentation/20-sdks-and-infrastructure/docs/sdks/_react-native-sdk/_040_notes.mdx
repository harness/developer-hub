If the SDK was instantiated in the `componentDidMount` method of a React component, `destroy` should be called in the corresponding `componentWillUnmount` method. 

Though releasing resources (when the SDK is no longer needed) is good practice, the SDK automatically hooks to application state transitions (foreground, background). Data synchronization is managed by the SDK and pending events are flushed automatically.
