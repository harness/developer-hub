Define the feature flags you want to use in the `features` object map. All `getTreatment` calls for a feature flag return the treatment (and config, if defined) that you have defined in the map. You can then change the treatment as necessary for your testing. To update a treatment or a config, or to add or remove feature flags from the mock cache, update the properties of the `features` object you've provided. The SDK simulates polling for changes and updates from it. Do not assign a new object to the `features` property because the SDK has a reference to the original object and will not detect the change.

Any feature that is not provided in the `features` map returns the [control treatment](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360020528072-Control-treatment) if the SDK was asked to evaluate them.

You can use the additional configuration parameters below when instantiating the SDK in `localhost` mode.

| **Configuration** | **Description** | **Default value** |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| scheduler.offlineRefreshRate | The refresh interval for the mocked features treatments. | 15 |
| features | A fixed mapping of which treatment to show for our mocked features. | \{\} <br />By default we have no mocked features. |

If you define just a string as the value for a feature flag name, any config returned by our SDKs will always be null. If you use a map, we return the specified treatment and the specified config (which can also be null).
