Call the `destroySplitSdk` function to gracefully shutdown the Split SDK by stopping all background threads, clearing caches, closing connections, and flushing the remaining unpublished impressions.
This function can be used as an action creator to update the `splitio` slice.

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

<Tabs
  values={[
    {label: 'Client side (browser)', value: 'browser'},
    {label: 'Server side (Node.js/SSR)', value: 'ssr'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="browser">

```javascript
import { destroySplitSdk } from '@splitsoftware/splitio-redux';

// you can dispatch the action to update the status at the store
store.dispatch(destroySplitSdk());
 
// the dispatched Thunk action returns a promise available as the return value of dispatch itself.
// this promise always resolves once the SDK has been shutdown
store.dispatch(destroySplitSdk()).then(() => {
  console.log(store.getState().splitio.isDestroyed); // prints `true`
});
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="ssr">
```javascript
import { destroySplitSdk } from '@splitsoftware/splitio-redux';

function serverClose() {
  // on scenarios where you need to destroy the SDK without dispatching the action, such as on server-side,
  // you can attach a callback that is invoked once the SDK has been shutdown
  destroySplitSdk({
    onDestroy: function() {
      console.log("Split destroyed");
    }
  });

});

```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

After `destroySplitSdk()` is dispatched and resolved, the evaluated treatments at the store will keep their current treatment values. However, if there is any subsequent attempt to use the `getTreatments` action creator, the treatments will be updated to `control` to be consistent with the JavaScript SDK. Also, the SDK [manager](#manager) methods will result in empty values.

:::warning[Important!]
Destroying the SDK is meant to be definitive. A call to the `destroySplitSdk` function also destroys the factory object. Attempting to restart the destroyed SDK by using the `initSplitSdk` action creator is not recommended and might lead to unexpected behavior.
