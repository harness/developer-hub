The SDK has a number of parameters for configuring performance. Each parameter is set to a reasonable default. However, you can override these value in the `config` object passed to the `initSplitSdk` action creator, as shown in the [Initialization](#initialization) section above.

To learn about all the available configuration options, go to the [JavaScript SDK Configuration section.](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360020448791-JavaScript-SDK#configuration)
