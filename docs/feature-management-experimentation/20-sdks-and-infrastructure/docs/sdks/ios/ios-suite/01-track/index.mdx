description: Track metric events to ensure the safety of your rollouts or run experiments.

Tracking events is the first step to getting experimentation data into Split and allows you to measure the impact of your feature flags on your users' actions and metrics. See the [Events](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360020585772) documentation for more information.

The Suite automatically collects some RUM metrics and sends them to Split. Specifically, crashes, ANRs and app start time (see [Default events](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/22545155055373-iOS-RUM-Agent#default-events-and-properties)) are automatically collected by the Suite. Learn more about these and other events in the [iOS RUM Agent](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/22545155055373-iOS-RUM-Agent#events) documentation.

To track custom events, you can use the `client.track()` method or the `suite.track()` method. Both methods are demonstrated in the code examples below.

The `client.track()` method sends events **_for the identity configured on the client instance_**. This `track` method can take up to four arguments. The proper data type and syntax for each are:

* **TRAFFIC_TYPE:** The traffic type of the key in the track call. The expected data type is `String`. You can only pass values that match the names of [traffic types](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360019916311-Traffic-type) that you have defined in the Split UI.
* **EVENT_TYPE:** The event type that this event should correspond to. The expected data type is `String`. Full requirements on this argument are:
     * Contains 63 characters or fewer.
     * Starts with a letter or number.
     * Contains only letters, numbers, hyphen, underscore, or period.
     * This is the regular expression we use to validate the value: `[a-zA-Z0-9][-_\.a-zA-Z0-9]{0,62}`.
* **VALUE:** (Optional) The value used in creating the metric. This field can be sent in as nil or 0 if you intend to only use the count function when creating a metric. The expected data type is `Double`.
* **PROPERTIES:** (Optional) An object of key value pairs that can be used to filter your metrics. Learn more about event property capture in the [Events](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360020585772-Events#event-properties) guide. Split currently supports three types of properties: strings, numbers, and booleans.

The `suite.track()` method sends events **_for all the identities_** configured on all instances of the Suite clients. For those clients that have not been configured with a traffic type, this `track` method uses the default traffic type `user`. This `track` method can take up to three of the four arguments described above: `EVENT_TYPE`, `VALUE`, and `PROPERTIES`.

Tracking per identity using `client.track()`:

```swift title="Swift"

let client = factory.client

// Expected parameteres are
let resp = client.track(trafficType: "TRAFFIC_TYPE", eventType: "EVENT-TYPE", , value: VALUE, properties: PROPERTIES)

// Example with both a value and properties
let properties: [String:Any] = ["package": "premium", "discount": 50, "admin": true]
let resp = client?.track(trafficType: "user", eventType: "page_load_time", value: 83.334, properties: properties))

// Example with only properties
let properties: [String:Any] = ["package": "premium", "discount": 50, "admin": true]
let resp = client?.track(trafficType: "user", eventType: "EVENT-TYPE", properties: properties)

```

Tracking for all identities using `suite.track()`:

```swift title="Swift"

// If you would like to send an event but you've already defined the traffic type in the config of the suite
let resp = suite.track(eventType: "EVENT-TYPE", value: nil, properties: nil)
// Example 
let resp = suite.track(eventType: "page_load_time", value: nil, properties: nil)

// If you would like to associate a value to an event and you've already defined the traffic type in the config of the suite
let resp = suite.track(eventType: "EVENT-TYPE", value: VALUE, properties: nil)
// Example
let resp = suite.track(eventType: "page_load_time", value: 83.334, properties: nil)

// If you would like to associate properties to an event and you've already defined the traffic type in the config of the suite
let resp = suite.track(eventType: "EVENT-TYPE", properties: PROPERTIES)
// Example
let properties: [String:Any] = ["package": "premium", "discount": 50, "admin": true]
let resp = suite.track(eventType: "page_load_time", proerties: properties)

```

The `track` method returns a boolean value of `true` or `false` to indicate whether or not the SDK was able to successfully queue the event sent back to Split's servers on the next event post. The SDK returns `false` if the current queue size is equal to the config set by `eventsQueueSize` or if an incorrect input to the `track` method is provided.
