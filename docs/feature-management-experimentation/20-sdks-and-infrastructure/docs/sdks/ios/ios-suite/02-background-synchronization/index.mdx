Background synchronization is available for devices having iOS 13+.
To enable this feature, just follow the next 4 steps:

1. Enable _[Background Mode Fetch](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchkit/background_execution/enabling_background_sessions)_ capability for your app.
2. Add the Split Suite background sync task identifier *io.split.bg-sync.task* to the Permitted background task scheduler identifiers section of the Info.plist .
3. Set the Split config flag _synchronizeInBackground_ to true .

```swift title="Swift"

let config = SplitClientConfig()
config.synchronizeInBackground = true

...
```

4. Schedule the background sync during app startup. e.g., _application(\_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)_

```swift title="Swift"

SplitBgSynchronizer.shared.schedule()

...
```

:::warning[Important!]
Due to an iOS limitation for background fetch capability, only one task identifier is allowed for that purpose. If there is already a current background fetch identifier registered, background sync may not work.
