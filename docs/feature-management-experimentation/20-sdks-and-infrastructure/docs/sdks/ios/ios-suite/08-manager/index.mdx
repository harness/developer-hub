Use the Split Manager to get a list of feature flags available to the Split client.

To instantiate a Manager in your code base, use the same factory that you used for your client.

```swift title="Swift"
let apiKey: String = "YOUR_API_KEY"
let key: Key = Key(matchingKey: "key")
let config = SplitClientConfig()
let builder = DefaultSplitFactoryBuilder()
let factory =
builder.setApiKey(apiKey).setKey(key).setConfig(config).build()
let manager = factory?.manager
```

The Manager then has the following properties and methods available.

```swift title="Swift"
/**
 * Retrieves the feature flags that are currently registered with the
 * Suite.
 *
 * @return an array of SplitView or empty.
 */
var splits: [SplitView] { get }

/**
 * Returns the names of feature flags registered with the Suite.
 *
 * @return an array of String (feature flag names) or empty
 */
var splitNames: [String] { get }

/**
 * Returns the feature flag registered with the Suite of this name.
 *
 * @return SplitView or nil
 */
func split(featureName: String) -> SplitView?
```

The `SplitView` class referenced above has the following structure.

```swift title="Swift"
public class SplitView: NSObject, Codable {

    @objc public var name: String?
    @objc public var trafficType: String?
    @objc public var defaultTreatment: String?
    public var killed: Bool?
    @objc public var isKilled: Bool {
        return killed ?? false
    }
    @objc public var treatments: [String]?
    @objc public var sets: [String]?
    public var changeNumber: Int64?

    @objc public var changeNum: NSNumber? {
        return changeNumber as NSNumber?
    }
    @objc public var configs: [String: String]?

}
```
