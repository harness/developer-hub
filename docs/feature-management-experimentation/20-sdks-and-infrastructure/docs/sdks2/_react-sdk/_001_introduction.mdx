React SDK is built on top of our JavaScript SDK core modules but is optimized for React applications. React SDK provides a set of components and custom hooks based on the React Hooks API, so your React app can conveniently use FME features.

This SDK also has an optional pluggable API for full FME functionality. If already using our isomorphic JavaScript SDK, consider this [migration guide](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360059966112-Browser-SDK-Migration-Guide) to understand the changes of the new pluggable API.

:::info[Deprecated HOCs & components]
High-Order-Components (`withSplitFactory`, `withSplitClient`, and `withSplitTreatments`) and components that accept a render function as child component (`SplitTreatments` and `SplitClient`) have been deprecated and might be removed in a future major release.

The deprecation is intended to simplify the API and discourage using old patterns (HOCs and render props) in favor of the *hook* alternatives, to take advantage of React optimizations.

Although these components are still working, we recommend migrating to the `SplitFactoryProvider` component and library hooks. Refer to the [migration guide](https://github.com/splitio/react-client/blob/development/MIGRATION-GUIDE.md#migrating-to-react-sdk-v200) for more details.
