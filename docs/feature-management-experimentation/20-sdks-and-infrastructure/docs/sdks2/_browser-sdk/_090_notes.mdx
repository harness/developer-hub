Since version 2.2.0, our SDK supports using a YAML file  to define feature flag definitions for localhost mode. This format allows the user to map different keys to different treatments within a single feature flag, and also add configurations to them. The YAML file is a list of single-key maps (one per mapping feature_flag-keys-config), defined as follows:

```yaml title="YAML"
# - feature_name:
#     treatment: "treatment_applied_to_this_entry"
#     keys: "single_key_or_list"
#     config: "{\"desc\" : \"this applies only to ON treatment\"}"

- my_feature:
    treatment: "on"
    keys: "key"
    config: "{\"desc\" : \"this applies only to ON treatment\"}"
- some_other_feature:
    treatment: "off"
- my_feature:
    treatment: "off"
- other_feature:
    treatment: "off"
    keys: ["key_1", "key_2"]
    config: "{\"desc\" : \"this overrides multiple keys and returns off treatment for those keys\"}"
```

The above example defines four feature flag **targeting rules** (for three feature flags):

 * The feature flag named `my_feature` returns the `on` treatment for the `key` user ID. Together with the `on` treatment the flag will return the configuration `{"desc" : "this applies only to ON treatment"}`.
 * The feature flag named `some_other_feature` returns the `off` treatment and no configuration.
 * The feature flag named `my_feature` returns `off` (except for the `key` user ID that is matched in the preceding rule).
 * The feature flag named `other_fourth" will return the `off` treatment and a configuration for two user IDs.

In this mode, the SDK loads the yaml file from a resource bundle file at the assets' project `src/main/assets/splits.yaml`.

If a split.yaml or split.yml is not found in assets, Split SDK maintains backward compatibility by trying to load the legacy file (split.properties), which is now deprecated.

The format of this file is a properties file as key-value line. The key is the feature flag name, and the value is the treatment name. The following is a sample `split.properties` file:

```bash title="split.properties file"
# this is a comment

# sdk.getTreatment(*, reporting_v2) will return 'on'
reporting_v2=on

double_writes_to_cassandra=off

new-navigation=v3
```
