```swift title="Swift"
client?.destroy()
```
Also, this method has a completion closure which can be used to run some code after destroy was executed. For instance, the following snippet waits until destroy has finished to continue execution:

```swift title="Swift"
let semaphore = DispatchSemaphore(value: 0)
client?.destroy(completion: {
    _ = semaphore.signal()
})
semaphore.wait()
```
