:::info[Migrating from v0.x to v1.x]
When upgrading, consider that the `webVitals` event collector (`import { webVitals } from '@splitsoftware/browser-rum-agent';`) is not exported anymore, but registered by default.

In case you were registering it with specific options, you can now pass the options in the `eventCollectors` property of the `setup` configuration object.

For example, replace this:

```javascript
import { SplitRumAgent, webVitals } from '@splitsoftware/browser-rum-agent';

SplitRumAgent.register(webVitals(WEB_VITALS_OPTIONS));

SplitRumAgent.setup(YOUR_SDK_KEY);
```

With this:

```javascript
import { SplitRumAgent } from '@splitsoftware/browser-rum-agent';

SplitRumAgent.setup(YOUR_SDK_KEY, {
  eventCollectors: { webVitals: WEB_VITALS_OPTIONS }
});
```

See the [Web Vitals](#web-vitals) section for more information about Google Web Vitals metrics collected by the Browser RUM Agent.
