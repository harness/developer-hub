Split's Browser RUM Agent is compatible with EcmaScript 5 syntax and therefore supports the majority of today's popular browsers, with the exception of older browsers like IE. We rely on the browser [Beacon API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/sendBeacon) support to reliably send information to Split services for processing. For browsers that do not support Beacon API, the RUM Agent defaults to using [Fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) or [XHR](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest) instead. 

Additional Web APIs like Promise, History and Performance APIs, highly available in modern browser, are required to collect some specific events, but not for the regular operation of the Agent. See the [Events section](#events) for specific events and their compatibility.
