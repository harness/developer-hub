## Overview

Our SDKs have a standardized interface for inputs to every method. If you have issues getting up and running with any of our SDKs or aren't getting the expected return from any method or to the Split UI, you can find a detailed view of the types of validation that our SDK performs for each method below.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs queryString="tab-number">
<TabItem value="1" label="GetTreatment Method Validation">

Below are the expected input data types for the method `getTreatment(key, split_name, attributes)`:

* key: `string` that is less than or equal to 250 characters
* split_name: `string`
* attributes: `dictionary`

:::info
For iOS, Android, and JavaScript, this method also has a signature of `getTreatment(split_name, attributes)`. If you are troubleshooting any of these SDKs, feel free to skip the Key Validations section below.

## Key Validations

key == null || key undefined (or similar for each language)
SDK will return control
SDK will log the following error to the console “getTreatment: you passed a null or undefined key, the key must be a non-empty string”
no Impression will be logged back to Split servers
key is longer than 250 characters
SDK will return control
SDK will log the error “getTreatment: key too long - must be 250 characters or less”
no Impression will be logged back to Split servers
key is of type number and is finite

<TabItem value="2" label="Track Method Validation">

Below are the errors and expected behavior you can expect from the SDK on the `track(key, traffic_type_name, event_type, value)` method.

:::info
For iOS, Android, and JavaScript, this method also has signatures without a `traffic_type_name` or `key`. If you are troubleshooting any of these SDKS, feel free to skip the Key and Traffic Type Validations sections below.

(Backend SDKs only) api_key == browser type
SDK will log the error: “factory instantiation: you passed a browser type api_key, please grab an api key from the Split console that is of type sdk”

If any of the above errors are encountered:

Any calls to getTreatment and getTreatments will return control or map of controls
Any calls to track will return false
Any manager methods will return null or an empty collection

## (JS and mobile SDKs only) Instantiation with a Key

key == empty string

(JS only) key == null || key undefined
SDK will log the error: “client instantiation: you passed a null or undefined key, key must be a non-

If any of the above errors are encountered:

Any calls to getTreatment and getTreatments will return control or map of controls
Any calls to track will return false
Any manager methods will return null or an empty collection

## Validations if ready config is not properly set

Ready == null (Backend SDKs only)

SDK will log the warning: “no ready parameter has been set - incorrect control treatments could be logged” if no ready config has been set when building factory

(JS SDK only) Log warning if there are no proper callbacks for either the event or the ready promise.

SDK will log the warning: “No listeners for SDK Readiness detected. Incorrect control treatments could be logged if you call getTreatment while the SDK is not yet ready”

(JS SDK only) If the readiness events are subscribed to AFTER the SDK is ready:

SDK will log the warning: `A listener was added for {event name} on the SDK, which has already fired and won’t be emitted again. The callback won’t be executed.`

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="4" label="GetTreatments Method Validation">

Below are the expected input data types for the method getTreatments(key, split_names):

key: string that is less than or equal to 250 characters
split_names: array

## Split Names Validations

split_names == null || undefined || not an array
SDK will return null
SDK will log the error “getTreatments: split_names must be a non-empty array”
no Impressions will be logged back to Split servers
split_names == empty array
SDK will return an empty object or collection

no Impressions will be logged back to Split servers

## Validations for each split name in split names Array

All the same checks will be performed for split_name as defined in the get_treatment section above. Our SDK will validate each split name and log the corresponding error for each. It will also filter out any invalid inputs and only include the valid inputs in the returned dictionary.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="5" label="Manager Interface Validation">

Below are a set of validations for the manager.split(split_name) method:

split_name == null || split_name == undefined
SDK will return null
SDK will log the error “split: you passed a null or undefined split name, split name must be a non-empty string”
split_name == empty string
SDK will return null
SDK will log the error “split: you passed an empty split name, split name must be a non-empty string”
split_name not type string
SDK will return null
SDK will log the error “split: you passed an invalid split name, split name must be a non-empty string”

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Validation for a Destroyed Client

Below is the behavior you can expect from the client if it is used after it has been destroyed:

All methods will log the error “Client has already been destroyed - no calls possible”
Any calls to getTreatment and getTreatments will return control or map of controls
Any calls to track will return false
Any manager methods will return null or an empty collection

## Tracked events not showing

Events sent via `client.track()` may not appear in the Harness FME UI even if the call succeeds. This usually happens because the FME Cloud silently rejects requests with invalid data.

Common causes include event type names containing invalid characters, such as spaces (e.g., `client.track("userId", "client", "my conversion");`), or specifying a traffic type that doesn’t exist in your Split organization (e.g., `client.track("userId", "IncorrectTrafficType", "conversion");`).

To resolve this, ensure event type names and traffic types follow the guidelines in the [SDK Overview documentation](/docs/feature-management-experimentation/sdks-and-infrastructure/sdk-overview/), and verify that the traffic types you use are defined in your organization.
