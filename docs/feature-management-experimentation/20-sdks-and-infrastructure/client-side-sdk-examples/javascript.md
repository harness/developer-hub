If it’s a JavaScript framework, Split almost certainly supports it. Whether it’s the hot new library out of the world’s largest social network or a project you’ve spun up at home, Split’s JavaScript SDK should work.

Check out our [Languages](https://www.split.io/product/languages/) section for a high-level look at our JavaScript SDK, or dive into Split’s [JavaScript documentation](/docs/feature-management-experimentation/sdks-and-infrastructure/client-side-sdks/javascript-sdk) for more. In particular, at the bottom of that article you will find some [example apps](/docs/feature-management-experimentation/sdks-and-infrastructure/client-side-sdks/javascript-sdk#example-apps).
