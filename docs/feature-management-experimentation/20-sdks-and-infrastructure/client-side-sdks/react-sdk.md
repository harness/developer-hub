This guide provides detailed information about our React SDK. This library is built on top of our regular [JavaScript SDK](/docs/feature-management-experimentation/sdks-and-infrastructure/client-side-sdks/javascript-sdk) to ease the integration in React applications by providing a set of components and custom hooks based on the React Hooks API, so you can interact with the underneath SDK and work towards any use cases. All of our SDKs are open source. Go to our [React SDK GitHub repository](https://github.com/splitio/react-client) to see the source code.

:::info[Migrating from v1.x to v2.x]
Refer to the [migration guide](https://github.com/splitio/react-client/blob/development/MIGRATION-GUIDE.md) for information on upgrading to v2.x.
:::

:::info[Deprecated HOCs & components] 
High-Order-Components (`withSplitFactory`, `withSplitClient`, and `withSplitTreatments`) and components that accept a render function as child component (`SplitTreatments` and `SplitClient`) have been deprecated and might be removed in a future major release.

The deprecation is intended to simplify the API and discourage using old patterns (HOCs and render props) in favor of the *hook* alternatives, to take advantage of React optimizations.

Although these components are still working, we recommend migrating to the `SplitFactoryProvider` component and library hooks. Refer to the [migration guide](https://github.com/splitio/react-client/blob/development/MIGRATION-GUIDE.md#migrating-to-react-sdk-v200) for more details.
:::

## Language support

The Harness FME React SDK requires React 16.8.0 or above, since it uses the **React Hooks API** introduced in that version.

The SDK supports all major web browsers. It was built to support ES5 syntax but it depends on native support for ES6 `Promise`, `Map`, and `Set` objects, so these objects need to be **polyfilled** if they are not available in your target browsers, like IE 11.

If you're looking for possible polyfill options, check [es6-promise](https://github.com/stefanpenner/es6-promise), [es6-map](https://github.com/medikoo/es6-map) and [es6-set](https://github.com/medikoo/es6-set) for `Promise`, `Map` and `Set` polyfills respectively.

## Initialization

Set up FME in your code base in two steps.

### 1. Import the SDK into your project

You can import the SDK into your project using one of the following three methods:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="NPM (recommended)">

```bash
npm install --save @splitsoftware/splitio-react
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Yarn">

```bash
yarn add @splitsoftware/splitio-react
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="CDN bundle">

```html
<!-- Don't forget to include React script tags before the SDK. More details at https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html#step-2-add-the-script-tags  -->
<script src="//cdn.split.io/sdk/splitio-react-2.2.0.min.js"></script>

```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 2. Instantiate the SDK and create a new SDK factory client

The code examples below show how to instantiate the SDK. The code creates a SDK factory, which begins downloading your rollout plan so you can evaluate feature flags, and creates a client.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="JavaScript (using CDN)">

```javascript
// CDN will expose the library globally with the "splitio" variable. Use the options that work best with your code.
const { SplitFactoryProvider } = window.splitio;

// Create the config for the SDK factory.
const sdkConfig = {
  core: {
    authorizationKey: 'YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_SDK_KEY',
    // key represents your internal user id, or the account id that 
    // the user belongs to. 
    // This could also be a cookie you generate for anonymous users.
    key: 'key'
  }
};

// Using the SplitFactoryProvider component, MyApp component and all its descendants have access to the SDK functionality.
const App = () => (
  <SplitFactoryProvider config={sdkConfig} >
    <MyApp />
  </SplitFactoryProvider>
);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="JavaScript">

```javascript
// The npm package exposes the different components and functions of the library as named exports.
const { SplitFactoryProvider } = require('@splitsoftware/splitio-react');

// Create the config for the SDK factory.
const sdkConfig = {
  core: {
    authorizationKey: 'YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_SDK_KEY',
    // key represents your internal user id, or the account id that 
    // the user belongs to. 
    // This could also be a cookie you generate for anonymous users.
    key: 'key'
  }
};

// Using the SplitFactoryProvider component, MyApp component and all its descendants have access to the SDK functionality.
const App = () => (
  <SplitFactoryProvider config={sdkConfig} >
    <MyApp />
  </SplitFactoryProvider>
);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="TypeScript">

```javascript
// The npm package exposes the different components and functions of the library as named exports.
import { SplitFactoryProvider } from '@splitsoftware/splitio-react';

// Create the config for the SDK factory.
const sdkConfig: SplitIO.IBrowserSettings = {
  core: {
    authorizationKey: 'YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_SDK_KEY',
    // key represents your internal user id, or the account id that 
    // the user belongs to. 
    // This could also be a cookie you generate for anonymous users.
    key: 'key'
  }
};

// Using the SplitFactoryProvider component, MyApp component and all its descendants have access to the SDK functionality.
const App: React.ComponentType = () => (
  <SplitFactoryProvider config={sdkConfig} >
    <MyApp />
  </SplitFactoryProvider>
);
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

**For more flexibility** as we wanted to support most use cases, the `SplitFactoryProvider` component can receive the factory already instantiated for our React SDK to use it. If you're using the JavaScript SDK already, it is recommended that you follow the Singleton Pattern and keep only one instance of the factory at all times, which you can provide to the React SDK following the approach shown below.

You could access the JavasScript SDK factory function through the `SplitFactory` named export of the React SDK too, which points to the original JavaScript SDK function so you don't need to import two different Split packages.

**Note that you shouldn't mix the two options**. Either provide a config or a factory instance. If both are provided, config will be ignored and you'll get a warning log.

When using the **`config`** prop, the `SplitFactoryProvider` component automatically instantiates and shuts down the SDK factory when the component is mounted and unmounted respectively.

Therefore, you should use the `config` prop for simpler setups where you know that the component [state in the render tree](https://react.dev/learn/preserving-and-resetting-state) will not reset, i.e., it will not be unmounted and mounted again (for instance, when you have a single `SplitFactoryProvider` component in the root or near the root of your app). Otherwise, a new factory instance will be created (if you pass a new `config` object) or the factory will be re-initialized (if you pass a reference to the same `config` object and the component is mounted again).

When using the **`factory`** prop, the `SplitFactoryProvider` component doesn't shut down the SDK automatically. You should handle the [shutdown](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360020448791-JavaScript-SDK#shutdown) yourself.

You can use it for more complex setups. For example, when you need to use the `SplitFactoryProvider` component in different parts of your app, or when the `SplitFactoryProvider` is nested in a component that might be unmounted and mounted again, for example in a tabbed view, or a micro-frontend architecture. In these cases, you can create the factory instance as a global variable, and pass it down to the `SplitFactoryProvider` components.

```javascript title="TypeScript"
// The npm package exposes the different components and functions of the library as named exports.
// If you were using the bundle via CDN, it'll be at `window.splitio.SplitFactory`
import { SplitFactory, SplitFactoryProvider } from '@splitsoftware/splitio-react';

// Create the SDK factory object with your custom settings, using the re-exported function.
const factory: SplitIO.IBrowserSDK = SplitFactory({
  core: {
    authorizationKey: 'YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_SDK_KEY',
    key: 'key'
  },
  ...
});

// Using the SplitFactoryProvider component, MyApp component and all it's descendants will have access to the SDK functionality using the provided factory.
const App: React.ComponentType = () => (
  <SplitFactoryProvider factory={factory} >
    <MyApp />
  </SplitFactoryProvider>
);
```

:::info[Notice for TypeScript]
With the SDK package on NPM, you get the SplitIO namespace, which contains useful types and interfaces for you to use.

Feel free to dive into the declaration files if IntelliSense is not enough!
:::

We recommend instantiating the SDK factory once as a singleton and reusing it throughout your application.

Configure the SDK with the SDK key for the FME environment that you would like to access. In legacy Split (app.split.io) the SDK key is found on your Admin settings page, in the API keys section. Select a client-side SDK API key. This is a special type of API token with limited privileges for use in browsers or mobile clients.  See [API keys](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360019916211) to learn more.

## Using the SDK

### Get treatments with configurations

When the SDK is instantiated, it kicks off background tasks to update an in-memory cache with small amounts of data fetched from Harness servers. This process can take up to a few hundred milliseconds depending on the size of data. If the SDK is asked to evaluate which treatment to show to a customer for a specific feature flag while its in this intermediate state, it may not have the data necessary to run the evaluation. In this case, the SDK does not fail, rather, it returns [the control treatment](/docs/feature-management-experimentation/feature-management/control-treatment).

To make sure the SDK is properly loaded before asking it for a treatment, block until the SDK is ready, as shown below. We provide the `isReady` boolean prop based on the client that will be used by the component. Internally we listen for the `SDK_READY` event triggered by given SDK factory client to set the value of `isReady`.

After the `isReady` prop is set to true, you can use the SDK. The `useSplitTreatments` hook returns the proper treatments based on the `names` prop value passed to it and the `core.key` value you passed in the config when instantiating the SDK. Then use the `treatments` property to access the treatment values as well as the corresponding [dynamic configurations](/docs/feature-management-experimentation/feature-management/dynamic-configurations) that you defined in Harness FME. Remember to handle the client returning control as a safeguard.

Similarly to the vanilla JS SDK, React SDK supports the ability to evaluate flags based on cached content when using [LOCALSTORAGE](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360020448791-JavaScript-SDK#configuration) as storage type. In this case, the `isReadyFromCache` prop will change to true almost instantly since access to the cache is synchronous, allowing you to consume flags earlier on components that are critical to your UI. Keep in mind that the data might be stale until `isReady` prop is true. Read more [below](#subscribe-to-events-and-changes).

 * as you remove both toggle and legacy component, then wire the version you'll keep.

 **/
export default class MyComponentToggle extends React.Component {

  renderContent(treatmentWithConfig) {
    const { treatment, config } = treatmentWithConfig;

    if (treatment === 'on') return (<MyComponentV2 config={config} {...this.props} />);

    return (<MyComponentV1 config={config} {...this.props} />);
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <SplitTreatments names={[featureName]} >
        {({ treatments, isReady }) => { // Passes down a TreatmentsWithConfig object and SplitContext properties like the boolean `isReady` flag.
          return isReady ?
            this.renderContent(treatments[featureName]) : // Use the treatments and configs.
            <Spinner />; // Render a spinner if the SDK is not ready yet. You can do what you want with this boolean.
        }}
      </SplitTreatments>
    );
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The treatments property/value returned by this library has the following shape:

```javascript title="TypeScript"
type TreatmentWithConfig = {
  treatment: string,
  config: string | null
};

type TreatmentsWithConfig = {
  [featureName: string]: TreatmentWithConfig
};
```

As you can see from the object structure, the config will be a stringified version of the configuration JSON defined in Harness FME. If there is no configuration defined for a treatment, the SDK returns `null` for the config parameter.

In some instances, you may want to evaluate treatments for multiple feature flags at once using flag sets. In that case, you can use the `useSplitTreatments` hook with the `flagSets` property rather than the `names` property. Like `names`, the `flagSets` property is an array of strings, each one corresponding to a different flag set name.

### Attribute syntax

To [target based on custom attributes](/docs/feature-management-experimentation/feature-management/target-with-custom-attributes), the SDK needs to be passed an attribute map at runtime. In the example below, we are rolling out a feature flag to users. The provided attributes `plan_type`, `registered_date`, `permissions`, `paying_customer`, and `deal_size` are passed to the underlying `getTreatmentsWithConfig` or `getTreatmentsWithConfigByFlagSets` call, whether you are evaluating using the `names` or `flagSets` property respectively. These attributes are compared and evaluated against the attributes used in the rollout plan as defined in Harness FME to decide whether to show the `on` or `off` treatment to this account. The SDK supports five types of attributes: strings, numbers, dates, booleans, and sets. The proper data type and syntax for each are:

* **Strings:** Use type String.
* **Numbers:** Use type Number.
* **Dates: ** Use type Date and express the value in `milliseconds since epoch`. <br />*Note:* Milliseconds since epoch is expressed in UTC. If your date or date-time combination is in a different timezone, first convert it to UTC, then transform it to milliseconds since epoch.
* **Booleans:** Use type Boolean.
* **Sets:** Use type Array.

<Tabs groupId="java-type-script">
<TabItem value="JavaScript">

```javascript
const attributes = {
  // date attributes are handled as `millis since epoch`
  registered_date: new Date('YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ').getTime(),
  // this string will be compared against a list called `plan_type`
  plan_type: 'growth',
  // this number will be compared agains a const value called `deal_size`
  deal_size: 10000,
  // this boolean will be compared against a const value called `paying_customer`
  paying_customer: true,
  // this array will be compared against a set called `permissions`
  permissions: ['read', 'write']
};

const ComponentWithTreatments = () => {
  const { treatments, isReady } = useSplitTreatments({ names: [featureName], attributes: attributes });

  const treatment = treatments[featureName].treatment;

  return isReady ?
    treatment === 'on' ? 
      <OnComponent /> : 
      <OffComponent />:
    <LoadingComponent />
};
```

<TabItem value="TypeScript">

      <OnComponent /> : 
      <OffComponent />:
    <LoadingComponent />
};
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Binding attributes to the client

Attributes can optionally be bound to the `useSplitClient` hook or the `SplitFactoryProvider` component via props. These attributes are stored in memory and used in every evaluation to avoid the need to keep the attribute set accessible through the whole app. When an evaluation is called, for example, with the `useSplitTreatments` hook, the attributes provided (if any) at evaluation time are combined with the ones that are already loaded into the SDK memory, with the ones provided at evaluation time taking precedence. This enables those attributes to be overridden or hidden for specific evaluations.

An attribute is considered valid if it follows one of the types listed below:
- String
- Number
- Boolean
- Array

The SDK validates these before storing them and if there are invalid or missing values, possibly indicating an issue, the storing is not performed.

To use these methods, refer to the example below:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Using the hooks">

```javascript
import { SplitFactoryProvider, useSplitClient, useSplitTreatments } from '@splitsoftware/splitio-react';

// Assuming this is how the user setup the factory:
const sdkConfig = {
  core: {
    authorizationKey: 'YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_API_KEY',
    key: 'nicolas@user'
  }
};
// These are the attributes bound to the main client, for key 'nicolas@user'
const userAttributes = {
  permissions: ["read", "write"]
};
// These are the attributes bound to a secondary client, for key 'nicolas@account'
const accountAttributes = {
  permissions: "read"
};
// The are additional attributes for the evaluation
const treatmentAttributes = {
  deal_size: 10000
};

const App = () => (
  <SplitFactoryProvider config={sdkConfig} attributes={userAttributes}>
    <MyComponent accountId='nicolas@account' />
  </SplitFactoryProvider>

function MyComponent(props) {

  // Do something with the treatments for the 'nicolas@user' key.
  // This evaluation combines SplitFactoryProvider component attributes with the ones provided to the useSplitTreatments hook.
  // Then it evaluates with attributes = { permissions: ["read", "write"], deal_size: 10000 }

  // You can retrieve clients for as many keys as you need, although it's not recommended to create more than you absolutely need to.
  // Keep in mind that if it is the first time you retrieve a client, it might not be ready yet.
  const { client: accountClient, isReady } = useSplitClient({ splitKey: this.props.accountId, attributes: accountAttributes });

  if (isReady) {
    // `accountClient` is ready to evaluate treatments as usual. To see more information about the client API, refer to the docs for JavaScript SDK.
    // In this evaluation, `treatmentAttributes`` are combined with `accountAttributes`
    const accountTreatments = accountClient.getTreatments(['ACCOUNT_FEATURE_FLAG_NAME', 'ACCOUNT_FEATURE_FLAG_NAME_2'], treatmentAttributes);

    // Do something with the treatments for the accountId key.
    // This evaluation is for another client, so factory attributes stored in main client will not be taking part.

### Append properties to impressions

[Impressions](/docs/feature-management-experimentation/feature-management/impressions) are generated by the SDK each time an evaluation is done using the `useSplitTreatments` hook. These impressions are periodically sent back to Harness servers for feature monitoring and experimentation.

You can append properties to an impression by passing an object of key-value pairs to the `useSplitTreatments` hook. These properties are then included in the impression sent by the SDK and can provide useful context to the impression data.

Three types of properties are supported: strings, numbers, and booleans.

<Tabs groupId="java-type-script">
<TabItem value="JavaScript">

```javascript
const properties = { 
  package: "premium", 
  admin: true,

### Shutdown

If the `SplitFactoryProvider` component is created with a `config` prop, then the component automatically instantiates and shuts down the SDK factory when the component is mounted and unmounted respectively. Otherwise, if the component is created by passing an SDK factory via the `factory` prop, you should handle the [shutdown](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360020448791-JavaScript-SDK#shutdown) yourself.

Use the `useTrack` hook to record any actions your customers perform. Each action is known as an `event` and corresponds to an `event type`. Tracking events through one of our SDKs or via the API is the first step to getting experimentation data into Harness FME and allows you to measure the impact of your features on your users' actions and metrics.

Learn more about using [tracking events](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360020585772) in Harness FME.

To track events, you must follow two steps:
1. Retrieve the client's `track` method, which is available through the `useTrack` hook or the `useSplitClient` hook.
2. Execute the `track` method call, passing in the traffic type and event info as arguments.

In the examples below, you can see that tracking events can take up to four arguments. The proper data type and syntax for each are:

* **TRAFFIC_TYPE:** The traffic type of the key in the track call. The expected data type is **String**. You can only pass values that match the names of [traffic types](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360019916311-Traffic-type) that you have defined Harness FME.
* **EVENT_TYPE:** The event type that this event should correspond to. The expected data type is **String**. Full requirements on this argument are:
     * Contains 63 characters or fewer.
     * Starts with a letter or number.
     * Contains only letters, numbers, hyphen, underscore, or period.
     * This is the regular expression we use to validate the value: `[a-zA-Z0-9][-_\.a-zA-Z0-9]{0,62}`
* **VALUE:** (Optional) The value to be used in creating the metric. This field can be sent in as null or 0 if you intend to purely use the count function when creating a metric. The expected data type is **Integer** or **Float**.
* **PROPERTIES:** (Optional) An object of key value pairs that can be used to filter your metrics. Learn more about event property capture in the [Events](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360020585772-Events#event-properties) guide. FME currently supports three types of properties: strings, numbers, and booleans.

The `track` method returns a boolean value of `true` or `false` to indicate whether or not the SDK was able to successfully queue the event to be sent back to Harness servers on the next event post. The SDK returns `false` if the current queue size is equal to the config set by `eventsQueueSize` config or if an incorrect input has been provided.

In case a bad input is provided, you can read more about our [SDK's expected behavior](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360020585772-Track-events).

Remember that:
- You must follow [React Hook rules](https://react.dev/reference/rules/rules-of-hooks) when using the `useTrack` or `useSplitClient` hooks, i.e., they must be invoked at the top level of your component or in custom hooks.
- The client's `track` method doesn't require the client to be ready, but it implies a side effect. Therefore, it should be invoked [outside the component render phase](https://react.dev/reference/rules/components-and-hooks-must-be-pure#side-effects-must-run-outside-of-render), such as in a `useEffect` hook or an event handler.

## Configuration

The SDK has a number of knobs for configuring performance. Each knob is tuned to a reasonable default. However, you can override the value while providing the config to the `SplitFactoryProvider` as shown in the Initialization section of this doc. To learn about the available configuration options, go to the [JavaScript SDK Configuration section](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360020448791-JavaScript-SDK#configuration).

## Localhost mode

For testing, a developer can put code behind feature flags on their development machine without the SDK requiring network connectivity. To do this, start the SDK in **localhost** mode (also called off-the-grid mode). In this mode, the SDK neither polls or updates from Harness servers. Instead, it uses an in-memory data structure to determine what treatments to show to the logged in customer for each of the features. 

When instantiating the SDK in localhost mode, your `authorizationKey` is `"localhost"`. Define the feature flags you want to use in the `features` object map. All `useSplitTreatments` calls for a feature flag return the treatment (and config, if defined) that you have defined in the map. You can then change the treatment as necessary for your testing. If you want to update a treatment or a config, or to add or remove feature flags from the mock cache, update the properties of the `features` object you've provided. The SDK simulates polling for changes and updates from the `features` object. Do not assign a new object to the `features` property because the SDK has a reference to the original object and will not detect the change.

Any feature that is not provided in the `features` map returns the [control treatment](/docs/feature-management-experimentation/feature-management/control-treatment) if the SDK is asked to evaluate them. Use the following additional configuration parameters when instantiating the SDK in `localhost` mode:

| **Configuration** | **Description** | **Default value** |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| scheduler.offlineRefreshRate | The refresh interval for the mocked features treatments. | 15 |
| features | A fixed mapping of which treatment to show for our mocked features. | {} <br />By default we have no mocked features. |

To use the SDK in localhost mode, replace the SDK Key with "localhost", as shown in the following test examples. Note that you can define the object between a feature flag name and treatment directly or use a map to define both a treatment and a dynamic configuration.

If you define just a string as the value for a feature flag name, the config returned by the SDK is null. If you use a map, we return the specified treatment and the specified config, which can also be null.

## Listener

FME SDKs send impression data back to Harness servers periodically and as a result of evaluating feature flags. To additionally send this information to a location of your choice, define and attach an *impression listener*. For that purpose, the SDK's configurations have a parameter called `impressionListener` where an implementation of `ImpressionListener` could be added. This implementation **must** define the `logImpression` method and it receives data in the following schema.

| **Name** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| impression |  | Object | Impression object that has the feature, key, treatment, label, etc. |
| attributes | Object | A map of attributes used on the evaluation (if any). |
| sdkLanguageVersion | String| The version of the SDK. In this case the language is `react` plus the version of the underlying SDK. |

:::info[Note]
There are two additional keys on this object, `ip` and `hostname`. They are not used on the browser.
:::

## Implement custom impression listener

The following is an example of how to implement a custom impression listener:

<Tabs groupId="java-type-script">
<TabItem value="JavaScript">

```javascript
import { SplitFactoryProvider } from '@splitsoftware/splitio-react';

function logImpression(impressionData) {
  // do something with the impression data.
}

// Create the config for the SDK factory.
const sdkConfig = {
  core: {
    authorizationKey: 'YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_SDK_KEY',
    key: 'key'
  },
  impressionListener: {
    logImpression: logImpression
  }
});

// Using the SplitFactoryProvider component.
const App = () => (
  <SplitFactoryProvider config={sdkConfig} >
    <MyApp />
  </SplitFactoryProvider>
);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="TypeScript">

```javascript
import { SplitFactoryProvider } from '@splitsoftware/splitio-react';

class MyImprListener implements SplitIO.IImpressionListener {
  logImpression(impressionData: SplitIO.ImpressionData) {
    // do something with impressionData
  }
}

// Create the config for the SDK factory.
const sdkConfig = {
  core: {
    authorizationKey: 'YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_SDK_KEY',
    key: 'key'
  },
  impressionListener: {
    logImpression: new MyImprListener()
  }
});

// Using the SplitFactoryProvider component.
const App: React.ComponentType = () => (
  <SplitFactoryProvider config={sdkConfig} >
    <MyApp />
  </SplitFactoryProvider>
);
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

An impression listener is called asynchronously from the corresponding evaluation, but is almost immediate.

Even though the SDK does not fail if there is an exception in the listener, do not block the call stack.

## Logging

To enable SDK logging in the browser, see how the [SDK Logging](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360020448791-JavaScript-SDK#logging) works.

This library own logger is not configurable yet, but will be very soon!

## Advanced use cases

This section describes advanced use cases and features provided by the SDK.

### Instantiate multiple SDK clients

Each JavaScript SDK factory client is tied to one specific customer ID at a time which usually belongs to one traffic type (for example, `user`, `account`, `organization`). This enhances performance and reduces data cached within the SDK.

FME supports the ability to release based on multiple traffic types. With traffic types, you can release to `users` in one feature flag and `accounts` in another. If you are unfamiliar with using multiple traffic types, you can learn more [here](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360019916311-Traffic-type).

If you need to roll out feature flags by different traffic types, instantiate multiple SDK clients, one for each traffic type. For example, you may want to roll out the feature `user-poll` by `users` and the feature `account-permissioning` by `accounts`. You can do this by retrieving different clients using the `useSplitClient` hook.

See some examples below:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Using the hooks">

```javascript
import { SplitFactoryProvider, useSplitClient } from '@splitsoftware/splitio-react';

// Assuming this is how we setup the factory:
const sdkConfig = {
  core: {
    authorizationKey: 'YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_SDK_KEY',
    key: 'nicolas@split'
  }
};

const App = () => (
  <SplitFactoryProvider config={sdkConfig} >
    <MyComponentWithFlags accountId='nicolas@account' />
  </SplitFactoryProvider>
);

// An example of how you can access a different SDK factory client to track events or evaluate flags in a function component with `useSplitClient` hook.
function MyComponentWithFlags(props) {

  // Calling useSplitClient with no `splitKey` parameter returns the client on the Split context.
  // In this case the main client associated with the key 'nicolas@split' provided on initialization.
  const { client: inContextClient } = useSplitClient();

  // If client was already instantiated, it is just a getter like in the regular JS SDK.
  const { client: myUserClient } = useSplitClient({ splitKey: 'nicolas@split' });

  console.log(inContextClient === myUserClient); // logs "true"

  // You can retrieve clients for as many keys as you need, although not recommended to create more than you absolutely need to.
  // Keep in mind that if it is the first time you retrieve a client, it might not be ready yet.
  const { client: accountClient, isReady: isReadyAccountClient } = useSplitClient({ splitKey: this.props.accountId });

  if (isReadyAccountClient) {
    // `accountClient` is ready to evaluate treatments as usual. To see more information about the client API go to the docs for JavaScript SDK.
    const accountTreatments = accountClient.getTreatments(['ACCOUNT_FEATURE_FLAG_NAME', 'ACCOUNT_FEATURE_FLAG_NAME_2']);

:::info[Number of SDK instances]
While the SDK does not put any limitations on the number of instances that can be created, we strongly recommend keeping the number of SDKs down to **one** or **two**.
:::

### Subscribe to events

The underlying JavaScript SDK has four different events:

* `SDK_READY_FROM_CACHE`. This event fires once the SDK is ready to evaluate treatments using a version of your rollout plan cached in localStorage from a previous session (which might be stale). If there is data in localStorage, this event fires almost immediately, since access to localStorage is fast; otherwise, it doesn't fire.
* `SDK_READY`. This event fires once the SDK is ready to evaluate treatments using the most up-to-date version of your rollout plan, downloaded from Harness servers.
* `SDK_READY_TIMED_OUT`. This event fires if there is no cached version of your rollout plan cached in localStorage, and the SDK could not download the data from Harness servers within the time specified by the `readyTimeout` configuration parameter. This event does not indicate that the SDK initialization was interrupted.  The SDK continues downloading the rollout plan and fires the `SDK_READY` event when finished.  This delayed `SDK_READY` event may happen with slow connections or large rollout plans with many feature flags, segments, or dynamic configurations.
* `SDK_UPDATE`. This event fires whenever your rollout plan is changed. Listen for this event to refresh your app whenever a feature flag or segment is changed in Harness FME.

While you could potentially access the JavaScript SDK factory client from the Split context and track this yourself, this is not trivial. The `useSplitClient` and `useSplitTreatments` hooks accept four optional boolean parameters to trigger the re-render of the component. If the parameters are set to `true` (which is the default), the component re-renders when an `SDK_READY`, `SDK_READY_FROM_CACHE`, `SDK_UPDATE` or `SDK_READY_TIMED_OUT` event fires, and you can take action if you desire to do so.

* For `SDK_READY`, you can set the `updateOnSdkReady` parameter.
* For `SDK_READY_FROM_CACHE`, you can set the `updateOnSdkReadyFromCache` parameter. 
* For `SDK_READY_TIMED_OUT`, you can set the `updateOnSdkTimedout` parameter.
* For `SDK_UPDATE`, you can set the `updateOnSdkUpdate` parameter.

The default value for all these parameters is `true`.

The `useSplitClient` and `useSplitTreatments` hooks return the SDK factory client and treatment evaluations respectively, together with a set of **status properties** to conditionally render the component.

These properties consist of the following:

- `isReady`: a boolean indicating if the `SDK_READY` event was triggered.
- `isReadyFromCache`: a boolean indicating if the `SDK_READY_FROM_CACHE` event was triggered.
- `hasTimedout`: a boolean indicating if the `SDK_READY_TIMED_OUT` event was triggered.
- `isTimedout`: a boolean indicating if the `SDK_READY_TIMED_OUT` event was triggered and the SDK is not ready to be consumed. Formally, `isTimedout` is equivalent to `hasTimeout && !isReady`.
- `lastUpdate`: timestamp of the last listened event.

const App = () => (
  /* Here MyApp function component is passed as a render prop component and not as a React element like <MyApp>.
   * MyApp is called with the SplitContext object as param, which contains the SDK factory, client and status properties.
   * As a child of the SplitClient component, it is called on SDK_READY, SDK_READY_FROM_CACHE,
   * and SDK_UPDATE events, but not on SDK_READY_TIMED_OUT since the `updateOnSdkTimedout` prop is false.

  <SplitFactoryProvider config={sdkConfig}  >
    <SplitClient updateOnSdkTimedout={false} >

</Tabs>

Default values for `updateOnSdk<Event>` options can be overwritten at the `SplitFactoryProvider` component level, and will apply to all child components.

```javascript title="Hooks"
const App = () => (
  <SplitFactoryProvider 
    config={sdkConfig} 
    updateOnSdkUpdate={false} // overwrite default value for `updateOnSdkUpdate` option to `false` for all child components 
  >
    <MyApp />
  </SplitFactoryProvider>
);
```

You can also access the `SplitContext` directly in your components for checking the readiness state of the client. Via the React [`useContext`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useContext) function, you can access the value of the `SplitContext` as shown below:

<Tabs groupId="java-type-script">
<TabItem value="JavaScript">

```javascript
import { useContext } from 'react';
import { SplitContext } from "@splitsoftware/splitio-react";

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { isReady, isTimedout } = useContext(SplitContext);
  return isReady || isTimedout ?
    <MyFeature /> :
    <Loading />
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="TypeScript">

```typescript
import { useContext } from 'react';
import { SplitContext, ISplitContextValues } from "@splitsoftware/splitio-react";

const MyComponent: React.ComponentType = () => {
  const { isReady, isTimedout }: ISplitContextValues = useContext(SplitContext);
  return isReady || isTimedout ?
    <MyFeature /> :
    <Loading />
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The `SplitContext` value object has the following structure:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="JavaScript/TypeScript">

```typescript
interface SplitContextValue {
  factory: SplitIO.IBrowserSDK,
  client: SplitIO.IBrowserClient,
  isReady: boolean,
  isReadyFromCache: boolean,
  hasTimeout: boolean,
  isTimedout: boolean,
  isDestroyed: boolean,
  lastUpdate: number,
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The `SplitContext` exposes the internal factory and client instances of JavaScript SDK which is used underneath. While the React SDK should enable most use cases when using React, you might be in a situation where you must use the SDK factory functionality directly, for example, to manage [User Consent](#user-consent) and [Logging](#logging) configurations. We discourage direct use of these instances unless necessary.

### User consent

The SDK factory allows you to disable the tracking of events and impressions until user consent is explicitly granted or declined. To learn how to configure this feature, refer to the [JavaScript SDK User consent section.](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360020448791-JavaScript-SDK#user-consent)

### Server-Side Rendering

The SDK follows the rules of the React component lifecycle by correctly handling the SDK factory creation and destroy side-effects and supporting running its components on the server side.

When running server side, the `config` prop of the `SplitFactoryProvider` must be used, and the `factory` prop must remain unassigned. This way, the HTML rendered on the server side will match the first render on the client side, because both sides will conditionally render your components with "no ready" SDK instances. At this point, status properties like `isReady` are `false` and the treatments retrieved using `useSplitTreatments` are `'control'`. Following this state, the SDK factory is initialized on the `SplitFactoryProvider` effect. Thus, the SDK factory will be ready on the client side on a subsequent render, but will not be initialized on the server side.

Usage for SSR is shown in the following code examples:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Vanilla SSR">

```javascript
// App.jsx
const myConfig = { ... }; // SDK configuration object

export const App = () => {
  return (
    <SplitFactoryProvider config={myConfig} >
      <MyComponentWithFeatureFlags />
    </SplitFactoryProvider>
  )
};

// server.jsx
import { renderToString } from 'react-dom/server';
import { App } from './App';

app.use('/', (request, response) => {
  const reactHtml = renderToString(<App />);
  response.send(`
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head><title>My App</title></head>
      <body><div id="root">${reactHtml}</div></body>
    </html>
    <script src="/client.js" async=""></script>
  `);
});

// client.jsx, bundled into client.js
import { hydrateRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
import { App } from './App'

const domNode = document.getElementById('root');
const root = hydrateRoot(domNode, <App />);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Next.js using Pages Router">

// pages/index.jsx
export const getServerSideProps = (async () => {
  ...
  const myConfig = { ... } // SDK configuration object
  return { props: { myConfig, ... } }
});
 
export default function Page(props) {
  return (
    <SplitFactoryProvider config={props.myConfig} >
      <MyComponentWithFeatureFlags />
    </SplitFactoryProvider>
  );
};
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Next.js using App Router (v13+)">

// SDK components are traditional "Client" components, so you need to use the 'use client' directive to nest with Server components 
// https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components

      <OnComponent {...props} /> :
      <OffComponent {...props} /> :
    <Loading {...props} />
};
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Usage with React Native SDK

The React SDK can be used in React Native applications by combining it with the React Native SDK. For that, you need to instantiate a factory with the React Native SDK and pass it to the React SDK `SplitFactoryProvider` component. The React SDK will use the factory to create the client and evaluate the feature flags.

<Tabs groupId="java-type-script">
<TabItem value="JavaScript">

```javascript
import { SplitFactory } from '@splitsoftware/splitio-react-native';
import { SplitFactoryProvider } from '@splitsoftware/splitio-react';

const reactNativeFactory = SplitFactory({
  core: {
    authorizationKey: 'YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_SDK_KEY',
    key: 'key'
  },
  ...
});

// Using the SplitFactoryProvider component, MyApp component and all it's descendants will have access to the SDK functionality using the provided React Native SDK factory.
const App = () => (
  <SplitFactoryProvider factory={reactNativeFactory} >
    <MyApp />
  </SplitFactoryProvider>
);
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
