Harness FME provides three containerized applications that can be run on your own infrastructure. These apps can handle specific use cases for feature flagging and experimentation with our SDKs and APIs.

Learn more by reading the blog post, [Kubernetes and Split](https://www.split.io/blog/kubernetes-and-split/), which provides architectural diagrams and sample configuration files to run [Split Evaluator](/docs/feature-management-experimentation/sdks-and-infrastructure/optional-infra/split-evaluator), [Split Proxy](/docs/feature-management-experimentation/sdks-and-infrastructure/optional-infra/split-proxy) and [Split Synchronizer](/docs/feature-management-experimentation/sdks-and-infrastructure/optional-infra/split-synchronizer) in Kubernetes.
