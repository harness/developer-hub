### Fetch Mode <VersionBadge version={props.addedInVersion}/>

In some advanced use cases, you may want to limit the number of network requests
to be fired during updates to the current user.

<>
  Since version <>{props.addedInVersion}</>, the {props.sdk} SDK supports{" "}
  <a href="#statsig-options">StatsigOptions.fetchMode</a>. Setting this option
  will change the bevahior of <code>Statsig.updateUser</code>.
</>

<br />
<br />

The supported FetchModes are as follows:

- `network-only` - This is the default behavior. The SDK will always fetch the
  latest feature gate and experiment values from the Statsig servers when `Statsig.updateUser` is called.

- `cache-or-network` - When set to this mode, the SDK will first check if a cached value exists for
  the user and was cached during this session (After `Statsig.initialize`).
  If no valid cache value is found, a network request will be made to fetch the latest values.
