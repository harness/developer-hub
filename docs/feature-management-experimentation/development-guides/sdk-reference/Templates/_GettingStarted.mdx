## Getting Started

<span>
  The following will outline how to get up and running with Statsig for{" "}
  {props.sdkType}.
</span>

### Create an Account

To work with the SDK, you will need a Statsig account. If you don't yet have an account, go ahead and [sign up](https://console.statsig.com/sign_up) for a free account now.

You could skip this for now, but you will need an SDK key and some gates/experiments to use with the SDK in just a minute.

### Installation

### Initialize the SDK

After installation, you will need to initialize the SDK using a Client SDK key from the ["API Keys" tab on the Statsig console](https://console.statsig.com/api_keys).

These Client SDK Keys are intended to be embedded in client side applications. If need be, you can invalidate or create new SDK Keys for other applications/SDK integrations.

:::info
Do NOT embed your Server Secret Key in client side applications
:::

In addition to the SDK key, you should also pass in a [StatsigUser](#statsig-user) for feature gate targeting and experimentation grouping purposes.

<!-- The terrible formatting below is to ensure the markdown works -->

{
  props.shouldSkipStatsigOptions !== true && <div>

The 3rd parameter is optional and allows you to pass in a [StatsigOptions](#statsig-options) to customize the SDK.

  </div>
}
