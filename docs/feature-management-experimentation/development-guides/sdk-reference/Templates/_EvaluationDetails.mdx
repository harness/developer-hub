### Evaluation Details

When you receive a value, it may be useful to know how the SDK came to that result. 
For this purpose, on every Statsig type there exists a way to check the `EvaluationDetails` object.

This object contains the following fields:

- `Reason`: This is a string containing the source as well as whether or not the specific config was found.
  - `Network:Recognized` means the SDK has the latest values and found an entry for the config.
  - `Cache:Unrecognized` means we are working with cached values, are could not find the given config.
  - For the full list of possible combinations, see the page on [Debugging](/sdk/debugging).
- `lcut`: Last Config Update Time - This is the unix timestamp for when **any** configuration in your project changed.
  - **lcut** works as a version number for you project. If it changes, values are deemed out of date and possibly need to be refetched.
- `receivedAt`: This is the unix timestamp of when the SDK received these values. This can be useful in knowing how old your cache is.
