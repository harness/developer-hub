  {props.sdkType}.

### Create an Account

To work with the SDK, you will need a Statsig account. If you don't yet have an account, go ahead and [sign up](https://console.statsig.com/sign_up) for a free account now.

You could skip this for now, but you will need an SDK key and some gates/experiments to use with the SDK in just a minute.

### Installation

<div>{props.install}</div>

<Gap />

### Initialize the SDK

Initialize the SDK using a Client SDK key from the ["API Keys" tab on the Statsig console](https://console.statsig.com/api_keys).  When creating the key, or using an existing key,
you will need to add the "Allow Download Config Specs" scope.  Client keys, by default, are not able to download the project definition to do on device evaluation.  You must opt in
to allow your client key to access your full project definition on our cdn.




<Tabs
  defaultValue="new"
  values={[
    {label: 'New SDK Keys', value: 'new'}, 
    {label: 'Existing SDK Keys', value: 'existing'},
  ]}>

  <TabItem value="existing">

To add the scope to an existing key, under **Project Settings** > **API Keys** > **Client API Keys**, select **Actions** > **Edit Scopes**, and "Allow Download Config Specs", then **Save**.
