### Prefetching Users During Initialization

If you have multiple user objects and wish to cut down on network calls, you may provide a prefetchUsers array as part of StatsigOptions during initialization.

<div>{props.config}</div>

### Prefetching Users Directly

You may also call the prefetchUsers method at any time after initialization.

<div>{props.methodCall}</div>

These users are evaluated on the Statsig server and the results are returned to the client.
Later calls to updateUser will not execute a network request if a user is found to be prefetched.

:::info
The prefetchUsers array is limited to 5 users. If a larger array is given, only the first 5 users will be taken.
