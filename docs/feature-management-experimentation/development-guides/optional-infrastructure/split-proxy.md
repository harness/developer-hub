description: Proxy for Split FME, to reduce connection latencies and increase security
---
Split Proxy is a service that can run in your own infrastructure and that behaves like Split FME's servers. Split Proxy can be used by both server-side and client-side Split SDKs to synchronize Split FME feature flag and segment definitions. You can set up and connect to Split Proxy, instead of connecting to Split FME Cloud directly.

Split Proxy can be used to reduce connection latencies. For security, if a single connection from a private network to the internet is required, it can be implemented using Split Proxy.
