This guide describes the basic steps for getting started with Split Feature Management & Experimentation.

## Quickstart guides

This series walks you through creating your first feature flag, using an FME SDK in your codebase, and measuring impact with experimentation.

* [Step 1: Create a feature flag and target users](./tutorials/step-1-create-feature-flag-and-target-users.md)
* [Step 2: Install the SDK](./tutorials/step-2-install-the-sdk.md)
* [Step 3: Send event data](./tutorials/step-3-send-event-data.md)
* [Step 4: Create a metric, monitor and measure impact](./tutorials/step-1-create-feature-flag-and-target-users.md)

You can also follow the SDK Setup and Event Ingestion **Quickstart wizard** in FME UI. Click **Help** in the left navigation menu, and click on one of the quickstart guides.

## FME Features

### Feature flags
[Feature flags](/docs/feature-management-experimentation/40-feature-management/index.md) turn on and off features to specific users or segments. You can tailor access to beta testers and early adopters based on individual IDs, attributes, dependencies, or percentages. Gradually target users little by little to limit the blast radius of your releases.

### Release monitoring
[Release monitoring](/docs/feature-management-experimentation/50-release-monitoring/index.md) detects the impact of each feature on system performance and user behavior, starting with the earliest stage of a gradual rollout. With detection and triage done at the flag level, you can ship more often and with greater confidence.



### Experimentation
[Experimentation](/docs/feature-management-experimentation/60-experimentation/index.md) centralizes notifications for metric impacts, review periods, and change requests, empowering your team with actionable data to make rapid, precise, data-driven decisions.

## Harness platform

If you're new to Harness, review the [Harness Platform onboarding guide](/docs/platform/get-started/onboarding-guide) and [Harness Platform key concepts](/docs/platform/get-started/key-concepts).
