This guide describes the basic steps for getting started with Split Feature Management & Experimentation.

## Quickstart guides

This series walks you through creating your first feature flag, using an FME SDK in your codebase, and measuring impact with experimentation.

* [Step 1: Create a feature flag and target users](./tutorials/step-1-create-feature-flag-and-target-users.md)
* [Step 2: Install the SDK](./tutorials/step-2-install-the-sdk.md)
* [Step 3: Send event data](./tutorials/step-3-send-event-data.md)
* [Step 4: Create a metric, monitor and measure impact](./tutorials/step-1-create-feature-flag-and-target-users.md)

You can also follow the SDK Setup and Event Ingestion **Quickstart wizard** in Split. Navigate to `https://app.split.io/org/[your-account-id]/ws/[your-project-id]/help/guides/sdk`.

## Maturity Curve

Feature flags form the basis of the platform, driving the risk out of continuous delivery and streamlining the development process. Flags allow you to assess application stability before customers are exposed to a feature, and a framework for Agile teams to release faster with less risk, including a kill switch to shut down a feature within seconds.  

Functional and performance issues are mission critical concerns for any application.  Key engineering metrics such as API response and page load time can be impacted by each feature. Split correlates relevant engineering KPIs back to the feature changes that are impacting them. While granular user targeting supports robust phased rollout plans.

So, you can release faster, but what does it matter if you are not releasing value? Experimentation provides development teams with a direct link to the customer for unprecedented feedback. Splitâ€™s real-time analytics engine measures the impact of feature changes on business outcomes.  

As we move up the maturity curve, teams can quickly iterate and refine functionality to deliver innovation faster and increase time to value.
