The diagram below shows FME objects and object relationships.

#### For feature management and experimentation engineers:

In FME, traffic types and environments organize and provide context for feature flag evaluations, metrics, and events. The diagram can give you insight into the structure and scopes of the FME objects that you work with and help you architect your feature rollout plans.

#### For FME administrators:

The diagram shows the Harness users and access settings that you use for permissions and approval flows within FME.
