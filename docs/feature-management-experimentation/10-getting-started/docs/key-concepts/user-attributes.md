A user attribute (also called traffic type attribute) is a property associated with a [user key (user ID)](./user-ids.md), like 'membership level' or 'signup date'.

:::note
User attributes are also called **traffic type attributes** (because they can be defined for all users in a given traffic type).

User attributes are also called **custom attributes** (because they are not pre-defined). You can define them in Admin settings or in feature flag targeting rules.
:::

User attributes can be used in feature flag targeting rules and in metric results or experiment analysis.
