In May 2024, Harness acquired Split, now called Harness Feature Management & Experimentation (FME). This page provides information to support you during the transition to Feature Management & Experimentation in the Harness Platform.

If you are using standalone Split you can continue to do so. Our customer success and support teams will be in contact with you to help you ensure a smooth transition into FME when the time is right.

For more information about the acquisition, go to the [Harness blog](https://www.harness.io/blog/harness-to-acquire-split).

## Authentication, access, and user management

Authentication, access, and user management are part of the Harness Platform. Permissions granted to users and user groups depends on their associations with resources and resource groups, which are controlled at the account, organization, and project level in Harness. For more information about authentication, access, and user management, go to the following:

* [Harness Platform authentication (including 2FA and SSO)](/docs/category/authentication)
