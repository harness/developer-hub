In June 2024, Harness acquired Split, now called Harness Feature Management & Experimentation (FME). This page provides information to support you during the transition to Feature Management & Experimentation (FME) in the Harness platform.

If you are currently accessing Split via `app.split.io`, our customer success and support teams will be in contact with you to help you ensure a smooth transition into FME on `app.harness.io`.

For more information about the acquisition, go to the [Harness blog](https://www.harness.io/blog/harness-to-acquire-split).

## Get started with Harness

If you're new to Harness, go to [Get started with Harness](/docs/category/get-started-with-harness) and learn about the Harness software delivery platform.

## Authentication, access, and user management

Authentication, access, and user management are part of the Harness platform. Permissions granted to users and user groups depends on their associations with resources and resource groups, which are controlled at the account, organization, and project level in Harness. For more information about authentication, access, and user management, go to the following:

* [Harness platform authentication (including 2FA and SSO)](/docs/category/authentication)
* [Harness RBAC overview](/docs/platform/role-based-access-control/rbac-in-harness)

## Administering a Migrated Split Account on Harness

Split administrators should read the [Before and After Guide: Administering a Migrated Split Account on Harness](/docs/feature-management-experimentation/split-to-harness/administering-migrated-account/). The guide will walk you through administrative tasks which change to standard Harness platform features after your migration into Harness.

## Harness platform integrations

We are moving rapidly to unlock integrations with Harness's innovative DevOps tools, developer experience improvements, security features, and cloud optimizations, while continuing to enhance the core of what you've previously known as Split. 

You can use Harness FME directly within the [Harness Internal Developer Portal (IDP)](/docs/internal-developer-portal). This integration allows you to view and manage your feature flags and experiments directly from your developer portal, alongside other Harness tools. 

For setup instructions and configuration details, see the [Harness IDP documentation](/docs/internal-developer-portal/plugins/available-plugins/harness-native-plugins/harness-fme).
