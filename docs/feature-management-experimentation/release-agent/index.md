## How your data is used

### Accuracy

While we strive to provide accurate information, we cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of the information provided by the chatbot. For example, LLMs can struggle with precision and context of numerical information. 

You can always reach out to support@split.io if you have questions or require additional help.

### Privacy

Your data is protected by the [Harness privacy policy](https://www.harness.io/legal/privacy), which has been agreed on by using the product. Release Agent uses OpenAI as a data subprocessor for the data summarization feature, so your data is additionally protected by the [OpenAI Enterprise privacy policy](https://openai.com/enterprise-privacy/). 

Additional ways that your privacy is protected:

* Your data will not be used for training. Neither by Harness nor by OpenAI.
* Harness will send OpenAI the minimal necessary information required to create data summarization.
