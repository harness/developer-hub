Trigger Pipelines Using Slack Events

You can trigger pipelines in response to Slack messages or events that match specific payload conditions you set up in a Harness trigger. For example, when a specific message is posted in a Slack channel or a particular event occurs, and your trigger settings match the payload conditions, a CI or CD pipeline can run.

Triggers enable event-driven CI/CD and support practices like building and/or deploying with every relevant Slack interaction.

Follow these steps to integrate the webhook and set it up for bot events in your chosen channel:

1. Go to the [Slack website](https://api.slack.com/) on your browser.
2. After logging in, click on **Your Apps** located in the top-right corner of the page.
3. On the **Your Apps** page:
   - Select an existing app where you want to configure your webhook.
   - To create a new app, click **Create New App**.
         1. Choose **From a manifest** if you want to use a manifest file to define the app's basic info, such as scope and settings:
            - Select the workspace where you want the app to be used.
            - Update the JSON content based on your requirements, such as the app's name, settings, etc.
            - Click **Create App**.
