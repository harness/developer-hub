Trigger Pipelines Using Slack Events

You can trigger pipelines in response to Slack messages or events that match specific payload conditions you set up in a Harness trigger. For example, when a specific message is posted in a Slack channel or a particular event occurs, and your trigger settings match the payload conditions, a CI or CD pipeline can run.

Triggers enable event-driven CI/CD and support practices like building and/or deploying with every relevant Slack interaction.
