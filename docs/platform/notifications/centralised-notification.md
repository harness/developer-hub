## Overview

Harness Centralised Notifications allow you to send notifications based on rules and conditions across pipelines and delegates. You can configure and manage alerts to stay informed about critical events in your Harness environment.

You can configure centralised notifications for:

- **Pipelines**: Get notified about pipeline events like success, failure, or stage completion
- **Delegates**: Receive alerts when delegates disconnect, expire, or are about to expire

## Pipeline Notifications

:::info Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the **`PIPE_CENTRALISED_NOTIFICATION`** feature flag enabled. Contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io) to enable this feature flag.
:::

Centralised Notifications for pipelines allow you to configure notifications for multiple pipelines at once instead of setting them up individually. You can create rules at different scopes—Account, Organisation, or Project—with each scope providing appropriate targeting options for the pipelines within its hierarchy.

These notifications are beneficial for tracking pipeline start, success, and failure events, as well as stage-level events (start, success, failure). This helps you monitor pipeline health and quickly identify issues across your deployment processes.

## Delegate Notifications

Central Delegate notifications provide proactive monitoring of Harness delegates, ensuring that you are immediately aware of connectivity issues and expiration. Rules configured at higher scopes automatically apply to delegates at lower scopes, based on your rule configuration.

These notifications help track delegate disconnection, expiration, and expiring soon events, allowing you to monitor delegate health and quickly identify connectivity issues that could impact your deployments.
