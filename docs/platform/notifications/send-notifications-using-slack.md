You can notify your User Group members using Slack as one of the notification channels. To do this, add a Slack Incoming Webhook into your Harness User Groups' [Notification Preferences](/docs/platform/role-based-access-control/add-user-groups#edit-notification-preferences).

Then you can add your User Group to a Notification Strategy and receive alert info in Slack.


### Before you begin

* See [User Group Notification Preferences](/docs/platform/role-based-access-control/add-user-groups#edit-notification-preferences)

### Visual Summary

Adding a Slack channel to your Harness User Groups **Notification Preferences** is as simple as pasting in a Slack Webhook:

### Step 1: Create a Slack App and Webhook for Your Channel

Follow the steps in Slack documentation for creating a Slack app, selecting your channel, and creating a webhook: [Sending messages using Incoming Webhooks](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks).

When you are done, you'll have a webhook that looks something like this:

Copy the Webhook.

### Step 2: Add the Webhook to the User Group Notification Preferences

1. In your **Account**/**Organization**/**Project** click Access Control.
2. Click **User Groups**.
3. Select the User Group to which you want to add notification preferences.
4. In **Notification Preferences**, select **Slack Webhook URL**.
5. Paste the Webhook into **Slack Webhook URL**  or add it as an [Encrypted Text](/docs/platform/secrets/add-use-text-secrets) in Harness and reference it here.  
For example, if you have a text secret with the identifier slackwebhookURL, you can reference it like this:
```
<+secrets.getValue("slackwebhookURL")>​​
```
  
You can reference a secret within the Org scope using an expression with `org`:​
```
<+secrets.getValue("org.your-secret-Id")>​
```
  
You can reference a secret within the Account scope using an expression with `account`:​
```
<+secrets.getValue("account.your-secret-Id")>​
```
6. Click **Save**.![](./static/send-notifications-using-slack-18.png)

Now your Slack channel will be used to notify this User Group of alerts.
