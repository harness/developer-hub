With notification settings, you can enable or disable notification channels at an account level. By default, all notification channels are enabled on an account. Organizations and projects in the account inherit the account-level settings.

When a notification channel is in the disabled state, no notification is sent for that channel, whether existing or new, until you enable the channel again.

You can enable or disable the following notification channels:
- Slack
- Microsoft Teams
- webhook
- PagerDuty

To disable a given notification channel, in Harness, go to **Account Settings** > **Account Resources** > **Default Settings** > **Notifications**, and then turn off the corresponding toggle.
