Before you can access Harness API, you must obtain an access token that grants access to that API. The access token allows you to make authorized API calls to Harness. These can be created at the Account/Org/Project level.

### Before you begin
* Make sure you are an Account Admin to Create, Edit, Delete, and Manage Service Accounts.  
For more details on permissions for API Keys, see [API Permissions Reference](../4_Role-Based-Access-Control/ref-access-management/api-permissions-reference.md).

### Harness API Key

You can create API Keys at Account/Org/Project scope and can get multiple access tokens under them. Harness lets you create two kinds of access tokens:

* **Personal Access Token** - You can create API Key and generate tokens under it, from your user profile.
* **Service Account Token** - As an Account Admin, you can create a Service Account with Specified Role Bindings and can then create API Keys and generate tokens under it.

Based on its type, the token would inherit permissions from the User/Service Account role binding.

### Create Personal Access Token

To generate a Personal Access Token, you need to first create API Key in your user profile.

1. In Harness, navigate to your **Profile**.
2. Click **API Key**. The API Key settings appear.
3. Enter **Name, Description,** and **Tags** for your API.
4. Click **Save**. The new API Key is created.

#### Generate Personal Access Token

1. To generate a Token for this API Key, click **Token** below the API Key you just created.
2. In the **New Token** settings, enter **Name**, **Description**, and **Tags**.

4. Enter date in **Expiration Date (mm/dd/yyyy)**.
5. Click **Generate Token**.
6. Your new Token is generated.![](./static/add-and-manage-api-keys-20.png)

You cannot see this token value after you close this dialog. Make sure to copy and store the generated token value securely.

### Create Service Account Token

To generate a Service Access Token, you need to first create a [Service Account](/docs/platform/User-Management/add-and-manage-service-account) and create an API Key under it.

1. In Harness, click **Home**.
2. In **ACCOUNT SETUP**, click **Access Control**.
3. Click **Service Accounts** and then click the service account to which you want to add a new API Key. For step-by-step instructions to add a new Service Account, see [Add and Manage Service Accounts](/docs/platform/User-Management/add-and-manage-service-account).
4. In the Service Account's settings page, click **API Key**.
5. In the **New API Key** settings, enter **Name, Description,** and **Tags**.
6. Click **Save**. The new API Key is created.

#### Generate Service Account Token
