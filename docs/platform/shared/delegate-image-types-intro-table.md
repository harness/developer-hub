The Delegate is a lightweight worker process packaged and distributed by Harness using different image types. Each Delegate image is identified by a delegate name, and the image type is specified using a tag.

| Image Type            | Image Tag                  | Image Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
