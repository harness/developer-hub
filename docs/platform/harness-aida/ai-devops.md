# Harness AI DevOps Agent Documentation

The **Harness AI DevOps Agent** streamlines your DevOps processes by enabling you to create and edit steps, stages, and pipelines with ease. Leveraging the power of Large Language Models, the agent provides intelligent suggestions, automates repetitive tasks, and now generates and integrates OPA Rego policies to help you meet your compliance standards.

## Installation and Setup

The Harness AI DevOps Agent is enabled directly within the Harness UI—no separate installation on an external tool or marketplace is required. Follow these steps to activate the agent:

1. Select **Account Settings** in the left nav. 
2. Under **General**, select [**Default Settings**](/docs/platform/settings/default-settings).
3. Find **Harness AI** and enable the **Harness AI** setting. 
4. Optionally, enable **Allow Overrides**. This will allow orgs and projects in the account to optionally override this setting and disable the agent.
