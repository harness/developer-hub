### Secret Creation and Update

Harness AI helps you create secret configurations by generating the secret object structure with proper naming, scope, and metadata. After AI creates the secret object, you provide the actual secret value manually in the Harness UI for security.

Harness AI creates secret configurations by:

- **Understanding secret requirements** - Analyzes your input about what credentials or sensitive data you need to store
- **Recommending secret types** - Suggests text secrets, file secrets, or SSH keys based on your use case
- **Generating secret metadata** - Creates the secret object with name, description, and scope
- **Setting up references** - Configures the secret for use in connectors, pipelines, and services
- **Guiding value entry** - Directs you to provide the actual secret value securely

For security reasons, Harness AI creates the secret object structure but **cannot and will not generate actual secret values**. After AI creates the secret, you must provide the real credential, token, password, or sensitive data through the Harness UI. This ensures your sensitive information remains secure and under your control.

1. Open the Harness AI assistant in your project or account settings.
2. Describe the secret you need to create. For example:
   - "Create a secret for my Docker Hub password"
   - "Set up a secret for GitHub personal access token"
   - "Add a secret for AWS access key"
   - "Create an SSH key secret for deployment"
3. Review the generated secret configuration:
   - Secret name and identifier
   - Secret type (Text, File, SSH Key)
   - Scope (Project, Organization, Account)
   - Description and tags
4. Preview the configuration in the YAML Preview panel.
5. Select **Create** to generate the secret object.
6. **Immediately provide the secret value** in the prompt that appears.
7. Select **Save** to store the secret securely.

Harness AI generates identifiers following these patterns:

- **Secret name** - Descriptive name indicating purpose (for example, `docker_hub_password`, `github_pat`)
- **Identifier** - Converts name to lowercase with underscores (for example, `docker_hub_password`)
- **Description** - Explains what the secret is for (for example, "Docker Hub authentication password for nginx images")

Use AI secret creation to:

- Quickly set up credential storage with proper naming
- Standardize secret naming across projects
- Create secrets at the appropriate scope level
- Generate metadata for compliance and audit trails
- Organize secrets with consistent tagging



#### Pipeline Summarizer

Harness AI can generate detailed pipeline summaries by analyzing your pipeline, its executions, and dependent resources. Use these summaries to quickly understand what your pipelines do without manually reviewing each step.

The DevOps Agent analyzes:

- Pipeline configuration and steps
- Recent execution history
- Dependent resources (connectors, secrets, infrastructure)

Harness AI then generates a natural language summary explaining the pipeline's purpose, key steps, and outcomes.

1. Navigate to your pipeline in the Harness platform.
2. Select **AI Summarize** in the 3 dots menu
3. Review the generated summary.

The summary appears in the pipeline details view and includes:

- Pipeline purpose and goals

- Review pipeline changes before approval

## Data Storage and Privacy Policies

Harness AI is designed with strict data privacy and security principles. This section explains what data is used, how it is handled, and how it is discarded when you interact with the DevOps Agent or any AI-powered features in Harness. No configuration is necessary to ensure your privacy since Harness applies strict privacy defaults:

- Training is disabled across all AI integrations.
- Data is not persisted or exposed to model providers beyond inference.
- Fallback mechanisms are used only when necessary and are compliant with strict retention policies.

This section discusses these policies in greater detail. 

### Data Privacy and Subscription Terms

For a full legal breakdown of AI privacy at Harness, see: [AI Data Privacy](https://www.harness.io/legal/harness-ai-data-privacy) & [Subscription Terms 2025](https://www.harness.io/legal/subscription-terms-2025).

### No Data Use

Harness AI processes real-time user input and relevant context (e.g., pipeline metadata or error logs) to generate responses. This data is not stored, not logged, and never used for training by Harness or its model providers.

### Minimum Data Retention

Data discard behavior depends on the underlying AI provider:

| **Provider**           | **Model**        | **Discard Mechanism**              | **Retention** | **Used for Training?** |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------- |
| Google Vertex AI       | Claude 3.7       | Immediately purged after inference | 0 days        | No                     |
| OpenAI (fallback only) | GPT-4o           | Retained for 30 days, then purged  | 30 days       | No (Harness opts out)  |

### Failover/Fallback Scenarios

In rare scenarios (e.g., outage or capacity limits), Harness AI may fall back to OpenAI APIs:

- OpenAI may retain the data for 30 days.
- Harness does not permit OpenAI to train on this data.
- After 30 days, the data is automatically purged.

### No Anonymization/Tokenization Required

No anonymization or tokenization is needed because:

- Data is not stored or used for analytics or training.
- All processing is done in ephemeral memory.
- Discard mechanisms are managed by the underlying model providers.
