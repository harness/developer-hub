## FAQ

### What natural languages does Harness AI support?

Harness AI can generate in widely used languages such as English, Dutch, Spanish, French, German, Hindi, Korean, Mandarin and more.

### Does Harness AI support code translation between programming languages?

Yes. Harness AI provides advanced code translation capabilities powered by large language models (LLMs). You can easily convert logic from one programming language to another using natural language prompts—directly within your IDE. For example, you can say, *“Convert this Python script to Java”* or *“Refactor this C++ logic into Go.”*

Our system achieves high-fidelity translations through specialized models that understand language-specific idioms and framework equivalences.
Currently supported languages and versions include:

### Does Harness support LLM-powered translation? 

Yes. Harness AI uses powerful LLMs to generate and adapt code like the following:
    - OpenAI GPT-4o
    - Google Gemini Flash
    - Claude 3.7 Sonnet

### Are domain-specific use cases supported?

Yes. Harness AI supports domain-specific tasks such as DevOps policy creation, YAML generation, and semantic validation using specialized language models. This ensures high relevance and accuracy for industry-specific needs.

### Does Harness AI support runtime awareness features?

Harness AI offers comprehensive runtime awareness capabilities that go far beyond code completion—empowering developers and DevOps teams to manage, automate, and optimize their software delivery processes with precision. We proudly support a comprehensive variety of runtime interaction features, fully integrated into the Harness platform and IDE-based workflows.

### Which application delivery features do you support?

Harness AI is designed to supercharge developer productivity by bringing intelligent automation directly into the IDE. It supports the following set of application delivery features that help teams move from idea to deployment faster, with less friction and higher confidence.

- In-line Autocomplete in IDE
- Multi-file Edits and Code Generation via Chat
- Agentic Task Completion (e.g., Refactoring)
- Build File Generation
- Non-code Artifact 
- Prompt-to-App (Create & Deploy from a Prompt)
- Harness AI’s open architecture allows teams to bring their own AI model, templates, tailored to internal frameworks or delivery pipelines.

### What agentic features does Harness support?

Harness AI natively supports event-based triggers like commits, bug creation, or test failures. These workflows can be configured through integrations with Git hooks, issue trackers, or CI/CD pipelines—allowing organizations to build automated assistants that react to defined events.

### Does Harness support multi-modal input for debugging to identify the source?

Harness AI supports comprehensive multi-modal debugging through:
- Stack traces: Advanced parsing and analysis of stack traces with context-aware identification of root causes, even in complex distributed systems. Our system correlates traces with codebase history to identify recently changed components that may have introduced issues.
- UI errors: Visual analysis of UI error screenshots, DOM structures, and console logs to pinpoint frontend issues. The system can identify responsive design breakages, JavaScript exceptions, and CSS conflicts.
