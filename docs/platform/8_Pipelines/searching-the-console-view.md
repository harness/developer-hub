When viewing execution details, you can search logs in the console view.

To view execution details, you must have run a pipeline at least once. If you haven't run a pipeline before, try a [tutorial](/docs/getting-started/quickstarts/) to get started with Harness.

## Search step logs

1. Go to the execution details page, and make sure **Console View** is enabled.
