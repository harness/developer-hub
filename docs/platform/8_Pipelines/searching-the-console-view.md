Pipeline executions can be viewed in Console View and you can quickly search the logs for each step.


### Before you begin

Before you can search execution logs, you need to run a Pipeline. See [Quickstarts](../../getting-started/quickstarts.md) to set up and run a Pipeline in minutes.

### Step: Search the Execution Step Logs

In the Pipeline execution, click **Console View**.

Enter `Cmd + f` (Mac), `Ctrl + f` (Windows).

You can also click the search icon.
