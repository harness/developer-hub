This topic describes the permissions available for [API keys](./add-and-manage-api-keys) and [service accounts](../../role-based-access-control/add-and-manage-service-account.md) in Harness.

These permissions are used by API keys to perform various actions through [Harness APIs](./api-quickstart.md). Subsets of these permissions are applied to [API keys and tokens](./add-and-manage-api-keys.md) when you create them. You can create API keys under your own account or service accounts, and the keys and tokens inherit [permissions](../../role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md) from the associated user or service account.

## Account

The following permissions allow an API key to manage a Harness account's details, settings, and license.

* View account: `core_account_view`

* View account [settings](/docs/category/settings): `core_setting_view`
* Edit account [settings](/docs/category/settings): `core_setting_edit`
* View license: `core_license_view`
* Edit license: `core_license_edit`
