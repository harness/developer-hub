The term entity is used to refer to the components of Harness. Most entities can be created at the account, organization, and project level.


### Examples of Entities

Here are some example of entity types in Harness:

* Account
* User
* Users Group
* Service
* Service Definition
* Environment
* Infrastructure
* Infrastructure Definition
* Pipeline
* Connectors
* Secrets
* Secret Managers

### Entity Identifiers

Most Harness entities and resources include a unique Id (Identifier) that is immutable once the entity is created.

Identifiers provide a permanent way to refer to an entity, and avoid issues that can arise when a name is changed.

See [Entity Identifier Reference](entity-identifier-reference.md).
