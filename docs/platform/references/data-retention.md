Pipeline execution data is stored for a maximum of 6 months.

Data retention for other Harness products differs by product and the plan you are subscribed to. For example, Harness CD and CCM have different data retentions.

To see the data retention for each product and plan, go to [Harness Pricing](https://harness.io/pricing/?module=cd) and look for **Data Retention**.

You can request a longer retention period by contacting [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io) if you require audit data for an extended period.
