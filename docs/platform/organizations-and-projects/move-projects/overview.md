This feature allows you to move a project across organizations, which is useful during restructuring, or ownership transitions.

## What happens when you move a project 

1. **Entities are moved**: [Supported entities](#supported-modules), such as pipelines, services, environments, and monitored services, are carried over with the project to the destination organization.

2. **Dependencies need to be reconfigured**: Resources scoped at the source organization levelâ€”like connectors, secrets, templates, webhooks, or notifications may become inaccessible. These dependencies need to be recreated or updated in the destination organization. References to account- or project-level entities remain intact.

3. **Access control and policies**: Organization-level RBAC policies, governance rules, and security policies do not transfer and must be reapplied in the destination organization. When a project move is initiated, all access control components are migrated asynchronously. During this process, access to the project will be temporarily blocked for users.

4. **Audit logs**: Existing audit logs are preserved, but any links in the logs pointing to source organization resources may break, as those resources will no longer be accessible.

For detailed pre-move validation and post-move remediation steps, see the [Move a Project guide](./pre-move-and-post-move-guide.md).

## Prerequisites

- Move permission for the project that you want to move.
- Create project permission in the destination organization.
