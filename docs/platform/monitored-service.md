A Harness monitored service, within the framework of the Harness platform, is a combination of a Harness service and an environment. This logical unit represents various types of workloads, like microservices, that can be monitored. Environments, on the other hand, represent the deployment targets, such as QA, production, or any other environment where the workload will be deployed.

A Harness monitored service functions as a unified logical entity across three modules: Continuous Delivery (CD), Service Reliability Management (SRM), and Continuous Error Tracking (CET). A monitored service can be created in the following ways within Harness:

- at the Project level
- within the CD module
- inside the SRM module
- within the CET module

## Create a monitored service at project level

Currently, this feature is behind the feature flag `SRM_COMMON_MONITORED_SERVICE`. Contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io) to enable the feature.
:::

When you create a monitored service at the Project Level, it becomes accessible across all three modules: CD, SRM, and CET.

To create a monitored service at the project level:

1. In Harness, select **Project** > **Monitored Services** > **+ New Monitored Service**.  
    The **Create new monitored service** dialog appears.

   <DocImage path={require('./static/create-monitored-service-project-level.png')} />
   DocImage

2. In the **Overview** section, enter the following information:

   - **Type**: Select the type of service that you want to monitor. You can choose either Application or Environment.

   - **Create or select a Service**: You can either select an available service from the drop-down list or create a new one. To create a new service, select **+ Add New**, enter a name for the service, an optional description, and a tag, and then select **Save**.

   - **Create or select an Environment**: You can either select an available environment from the drop-down list or create a new one. To create a new environment:

     1. Select **+ Add New**.

     2. In the New Environment dialog, do the following:

        - Enter a name for the service, an optional description, and a tag.

        - Select an environment type. You can choose **Production** or **Non-Production**.

        - Configure the environment overrides. You can define what will be overridden when a service is deployed in this environment.

     3. Select **Save**.

3. Enter a name for the monitored service, an optional description, and a tag.
4. Select **Save**.
   The monitored service is created and appears in the list of existing monitored services.

### View the list of monitored services at project level

To view the list of monitored services:

1. In Harness, select **Project** > **Monitored Services**.

   A comprehensive list of all monitored services is displayed. The list includes the names of monitored services along with a count of health sources configured for each service.

   <DocImage path={require('./static/view-monitored-service-project-level.png')} />

### View monitored service details

DocImage
You can view detailed information about a monitored service by clicking directly on the monitored service's name in the list.

#### View monitored service details from a specific module

To view the monitored service details within a specific module:

1. Locate the monitored service you're interested in within the list.
2. In the **Go To** column, you'll notice module icons corresponding to various modules such as Continuous Delivery, Service Reliability Management, and Continuous Error Tracking.
3. Select the module icon that corresponds to the Harness module from which you want to view the monitored service details. You will be automatically navigated to that specific module. The monitored service details page with the information relevant to that specific module is displayed.

   For example, if you want to view the monitored service details from the SRM module, select the Service Reliability Management icon. You will be automatically navigated to the SRM module, and the monitored service details page with information specific to that module will be displayed.

## Monitored service within the Continuous Delivery (CD) module

:::info note
Currently, this feature is behind the feature flag `SRM_COMMON_MONITORED_SERVICE`. Contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io) to enable the feature.
:::

In the CD module, when you're using the Verify Step for Continuous Verification (CV), the system automatically generates a monitored service. This happens by combining the names of the service and the environment. This monitored service is readily available within the CD module.

To view the monitored service list from the CD module:

1. In Harness, select **Deployment** > **Monitored Services**.  
   A list of monitored services is displayed. The list also displays the number of health sources configured for each monitored service.

<DocImage path={require('./static/view-monitored-service-cd-level.png')} />

## Monitored service within the Service Reliability Management (SRM) module

You can view and create monitored services from the SRM module.

To view the monitored service list from the SRM module:

1. In Harness, select **Service Reliability** > **Monitored Services**.
   DocImage
   A list of monitored services is displayed. The list provides information such as the service's enablement status, name, SLO and error budget details, recent changes and health trends in the past 24 hours, health score, and health status of associated dependencies.

   <DocImage path={require('./static/view-monitored-service-srm-level.png')} />

You can [create a monitored service](../service-reliability-management/monitored-service/create-monitored-service.md) directly from the SRM module.

## Monitored service within the Continuous Error Tracking (CET) module

:::info note
Currently, this feature is behind the feature flag `CET_PLATFORM_MONITORED_SERVICE`. Contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io) to enable the feature.
:::

You DocImage and create monitored services from the CET module.

To view the monitored service list from the CET module:

1. In Harness, select **Error Tracking** > **Monitored Services**.

   A list of monitored services is displayed.
   The list includes details such as the service name and indicates whether the Error Tracking Agent and notifications are configured.

   <DocImage path={require('./static/view-monitored-service-cet-level.png')} />

You can [create a monitored service](../continuous-error-tracking/get-started/onboarding-guide.md) directly from the CET module.
