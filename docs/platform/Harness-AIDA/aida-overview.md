The Harness platform leverages Harness AI Development Assistant (AIDA) to revolutionize software delivery processes. By combining AI capabilities with robust DevOps tools, features, and practices, the Harness platform streamlines and accelerates the software development lifecycle, and it empowers teams to deliver high-quality applications quickly and efficiently. Its AI-driven predictive analytics, continuous verification, and advanced release orchestration capabilities empowers teams to drive innovation, improve efficiency, and ultimately deliver exceptional user experiences.

Following are some key benefits of Harness AIDA:

- Auto-recognition of failures in pipelines: The root cause analysis (RCA) option generates recommendations for step failures in pipelines. Harness bases these recommendations on the step logs and the context of the failed step.

- Asset governance: The asset governance feature assists you in drafting rules that are based on your requirements and aligned with your governance goals. Harness AIDA governance support also offers detailed descriptions of built-in rules. When you are creating policies, this feature facilitates informed decision-making by clarifying the purpose, scope, and implications of each rule.

- Security: Harness AI identifies security vulnerabilities, describes them, and suggests remediation.
