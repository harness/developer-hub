The Harness Platform uses several mechanisms, including rate limits, to safeguard against bursts of incoming traffic and help maximize stability. A rate limiter restricts the number of requests received within any given minute, after which Harness throttles requests from the IP address.

:::info note
Throttling is a type of rate limiting used to control the amount of traffic that an application can handle. It is a way of limiting the number of requests accepted in a given period.
:::

Harness has several rate limiters in the platform. Users who send multiple requests in quick succession may receive status code 429 error responses.

:::info note
Retry-After in the 429 error responses is not currently supported by Google Cloud Armor.

Harness Platform rate limits include:

- Any call: Harness allows 5000 requests every 10 seconds (30,000 requests per minute) per IP address.
- API calls: Harness allows 1000 requests per API key per minute.
- External API requests: 400 calls per minute per X-API-Key.
- GraphQL APIs (FirstGen only): Harness allows up to 1000 requests per minute per IP address.
- Large requests (character size > 500,000): 1 payload every 10 seconds.
- Reset password: 5 calls per minute per IP address.
- User invites: 10 calls per minute per IP address.

:::info important
Harness reserves the right to change limits at any time to protect the platform.
