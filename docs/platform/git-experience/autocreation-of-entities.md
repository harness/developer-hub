title: Autocreation of Entities in Harness
description: This Page talks about auto creation of Harness entities
---

Autocreation is a feature that allows you to automatically create entities in Harness when files are added remotely within your Git Repository.  The files, in this case, are created within Git, so the object is initiated and created within your repository in the [correct directory](#file-path-convention).  

This differs from [moving inline entities to Git](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/git-experience/move-inline-entities-to-git/) and [enabling bidirectional sync](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/git-experience/gitexp-bidir-sync-setup/) as for this case, customers would be initially creating objects from the Harness UI rather than initiating from Git, and do not have to follow a directory structure for the objects being saved in the Git Repo.

## Pre-requisites of Autocreation

- Register the webhook for your repository where you are adding your files remotely. The scope of the webhook should match the entity it's trying to create. For example, a project-level webhook can only create entities within the same project, whereas an account-level webhook can create entities across multiple projects and the organizations.
- Added files should follow a [specific file path convention based on the entity type](#file-path-convention). The file paths would be created manually and can be created on an as-needed-basis.

:::info note
Files that are added only in the default branch(main, master etc) of the Git Repo are autocreated.
:::


## File Path Convention

We need to follow a specific file convention for each entity for auto-creation. This is required to infer the scope of the entity as well as type of entity from the filepath.

:::info note
Files under `.harness` folder are only used for auto-creation as of now. Therefore, to create files automatically via remote, all file paths must begin with `.harness`. Webhooks will, by default, track the `.harness` folder.
:::

We will discuss the file path convention for each entity with an example:-


:::info note
The file path name of the entity YAML can be anything, as the name and identifier of the entity are picked up from the YAML itself that you are pushing to your Git repository. If the name and identifier are not provided in the YAML, then the file name will be used as the name and identifier.

### Pipelines

File path for storing your pipelines should follow the following naming convention:

## Creation of Entities

:::info note
During the autocreation of entities, if a user commits more than 300 files in a single commit, the autocreation of entities for those files will fail. Files received as a response from GitHub (fewer than 300) will be processed correctly. However, commits with more than 300 files will not be handled, potentially leading to discrepancies where users may not see the expected results.
:::

Since we have discussed the file path conventions for each entities let's see how to create entities with help of autocreation. We are going to discuss creation of Pipeline and Input set in these examples, similar approach can be followed for creating other entities like Services, Environments, Templates and Infrastructure.

You can refer to [YAML schema](/docs/platform/pipelines/harness-yaml-quickstart/#yaml-schema) for creating Harness entities via YAML.


#### Pipelines

In this example, we are going to follow the same names that we have discussed while discussing file path examples of different entities.

Let's create a pipeline under organization `default` and project `Krishika_test_autocreation`.

We have our pipeline yaml stored under `pipeline` directory :-

`.harness/orgs/default/projects/Krishika_test_autocreation/pipelines/demo_autocreation_pipeline.yaml`

Let's consider this example yaml that we are going to put under **demo_autocreation_pipeline.yaml**:

```yaml
pipeline:
  name: demo_autocreation_pipeline
  identifier: demo_autocreation_pipeline
  projectIdentifier: Krishika_test_autocreation
  orgIdentifier: default
  tags: {}
  stages:
    - stage:
        name: custom
        identifier: custom
        description: ""
        type: Custom
        spec:
          execution:
            steps:
              - step:
                  type: ShellScript
                  name: ShellScript_1
                  identifier: ShellScript_1
                  spec:
                    shell: Bash
                    executionTarget: {}
                    source:
                      type: Inline
                      spec:
                        script: |
                          input_variable=<+pipeline.variables.input_variable>
                          echo "the value is:$input_variable"
                    environmentVariables: []
                    outputVariables: []
                  timeout: 10m
        tags: {}
  variables:
    - name: input_variable
      type: String
      description: ""
      required: false
      value: <+input>
```
After saving this YAML file, we will push it to our Git repository, for which we have registered the webhook in Harness. We can then view this event on our Webhook Events page.

![](./static/webhook_event_listing.png)

```
git add .harness/orgs/default/projects/Krishika_test_autocreation/pipelines/demo_autocreation_pipeline.yaml
git commit -m "Add pipeline yaml"
git push
```

After pushing the changes, pipeline named as **demo_autocreation_pipeline** is created in Organization **default** under the Project **Krishika_test_autocreation** .

![](./static/pipeline_creation_autocreation.png)

#### Input Sets

Let's create an Input set that we are going to use inside our Pipeline `demo_autocreation_pipeline`.

We have our input set YAML stored under the directory of the pipeline identifier 
**demo_autocreation_pipeline**, specifically under the **input_sets** directory  :

`.harness/orgs/default/projects/Krishika_test_autocreation/pipelines/demo_autocreation_pipeline/input_sets/demo_autocreation_inputSet.yaml`

Let's consider this example yaml that we are going to put under **demo_autocreation_inputSet.yaml**:

```yaml
inputSet:
  name: input_set
  tags: {}
  identifier: input_set
  orgIdentifier: default
  projectIdentifier: Krishika_test_autocreation
  pipeline:
    identifier: demo_autocreation_pipeline
    variables:
      - name: input_variable
        type: String
        value: hello
```

After saving this YAML file, we will push it to our Git repository, for which we have registered the webhook in Harness. We can then view this event on our Webhook Events page.

```
git add .harness/orgs/default/projects/Krishika_test_autocreation/pipelines/demo_autocreation_pipeline/demo_autocreation_inputSet.yaml
git commit -m "Add input set yaml"
git push
```

After pushing the changes, we will see that Input set named as **input_set** is created for the pipeline **demo_autocreation_pipeline**. 

![](./static/input_set_creation_autocreation.png)

:::info note
- Harness RBAC is not applicable in Autocreation. The scope of the webhook should match the entity it's trying to create. For example, a project-level webhook can only create entities within the same project, whereas an account-level webhook can create entities across multiple projects and the organizations. If you are able to push to the default branch, you will be able to create the entity in Harness.
- When files are deleted in Git, the corresponding entity is not removed; instead, it's just an automatic creation process, not a complete Git sync.
