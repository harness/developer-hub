You can return the character at a specified index in a Harness variable expression string.

This can be helpful with [built-in variable expressions](harness-variables.md) such as `<+artifact.tag>`, `<+artifact.image>`, or variables that contain version numbers or other important strings.

To return characters, you can use the `charAt()` method with your variable expression.

### Step 1: Use the charAt() Method

Let's look at an example where you have a variable named `<+version>`. that evaluates to `1234`.

To get the first character of the string, you would use `<+<+version>.charAt(0)>`. This would return `1`.

The `<+version>` references the variable, and the rest of the expression evaluates the string using the `charAt()` method.
