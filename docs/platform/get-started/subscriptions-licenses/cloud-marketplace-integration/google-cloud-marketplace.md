The [Google Cloud Marketplace](https://cloud.google.com/marketplace?hl=en) enables software vendors to offer their products and services to customers directly through Google Cloud Platform (GCP). It provides a convenient platform for users to discover, purchase, and deploy software solutions directly from the Google Cloud console or through APIs.

## Purchase Harness products via the Google Cloud Marketplace public offer flow

A Google Cloud Marketplace public listing is a software/service offering that is publicly available and accessible to all users of the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). When a product or service is listed as public on the Google Cloud Marketplace, then any GCP customer can discover, evaluate, and potentially deploy that offering within their own cloud environment.

The public offer flow is a self-serve model where you can discover a product, view pricing, make a purchase, and start using the product as soon as the order/account is approved.

Harness currently offers [Harness Continuous Delivery](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/harness-public/harness-continuous-delivery) for purchase through the public offer flow.

### Subscribe to the publicly-listed Harness product

To subscribe to a publicly-listed Harness product:

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Marketplace](https://cloud.google.com/marketplace?hl=en).

2. Select **Explore the marketplace**, and then search `Harness`.

3. Select the Harness product to which you want to subscribe.

   If the product is listed publicly, you can view pricing, and the **Subscribe** option is available.

6. After you select the plan and finalize the subscription, select **Sign up with the provider**. This option uses your sign-up information to create a Harness account for the email address you provided during the sign up process.

7. Sign in to start using the Harness Continuous Delivery product.
