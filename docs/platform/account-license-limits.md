The Harness Platform enforces limits at account level to ensure optimal performance and system stability. These limits help manage resources and ensure that accounts operate within defined thresholds.

:::info note 
Account limits define the maximum number of specific resources or entities that can be created under a particular account. Once the limits are reached, no additional entities can be created.
