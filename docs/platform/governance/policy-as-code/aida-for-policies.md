Harness AI Development Assistant (AIDA&trade;) includes comprehensive support for the following functionalities:

- **Create OPA Policies:** Harness AIDA helps you get started and write OPA Policies based on pipelines, connectors, and templates, and other Harness objects with no need to understand the nuances of REGO (Open Policy Agent language).

- **Describe existing OPA Policies:** Harness AIDA offers detailed descriptions of policies. This helps users understand what a policy does without having to fully understand REGO syntax and reading and tracing comments in the policy.

7. Proceed to **Save the Policy**.

### Describe a Harness Policy by using Harness AIDA​

Using Harness AIDA, you can describe policies created in the account. This helps users understand the policy at a high level without deep understanding and expertise on REGO. Users immediately know what the policy does and its failure criteria. This knowledge enables users to tweak and improve policies downstream as needed.
