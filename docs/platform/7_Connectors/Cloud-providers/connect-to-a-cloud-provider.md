Harness cloud provider connectors integrate your cloud platforms with Harness. You set up connectors with the connection information and credentials you need to perform tasks in Harness, such as deploying services.

See the following topics:

- [Kubernetes cluster connector](add-a-kubernetes-cluster-connector.md) (platform agnostic)
- [AWS connector](add-aws-connector.md)
- [GCP connector](connect-to-google-cloud-platform-gcp.md)
- [Azure connector](add-a-microsoft-azure-connector.md)
- [Tanzu Application Services connector](add-tas-connector.md)
- [Physical Data Center connector](pdc-connector.md)
