Connect Harness to monitoring and logging systems by adding a verification provider Connector.

You can add a verification provider Connector inline when developing your pipeline, or separately in your Account/Org/Project's resources. Once you add the Connector, it is available in Pipelines of the same Account/Org/Project.


### Monitoring and Logging Systems Scope

You can add a verification provider Connector at the Account/Org/Project scope.

This topic will explain how to add it at the Project scope. The process is same for Org and Account.

### Step: Add AppDynamics

1. Open a Harness Project.
2. In **Project Setup**, click **Connectors**.
3. Click **+** **Connector**, and click **AppDynamics** in **Monitoring and Logging Systems**. The AppDynamics connector settings appear.

1. Click **Continue**. The Setup Delegates settings appear.
2.  You can choose **Connect via any available delegate** or **Connect only via delegates which has all of the following tags.** If you select a Delegate, Harness will always use that Delegate for this Connector.
3.  Click **Save and Continue**.
4.  Once the Test Connection succeeds, click **Finish**. New Relic is listed under the list of Connectors.

Usage scope is inherited from the secrets used in the settings. Pro or higher subscription level is needed. For more information, see [Introduction to New Relic's REST API Explorer](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/api-explorer-v2/introduction-new-relics-rest-api-explorer) from New Relic.

### Step: Add Splunk

1. Open a Harness Project.
2. In **Project Setup**, click **Connectors**.
3. Click **+** **Connector**, and click **Splunk**in **Monitoring and Logging Systems**. The Splunk connector settings appear.
   
   ![](../static/connect-to-monitoring-and-logging-systems-18.png)
   
4. In **Name**, enter a name for this connector. If you are going to use multiple providers of the same type, ensure you give each provider a different name.
5. Click **Continue**.
6. In the **URL** field, enter the URL for accessing the REST API on the Splunk server. Include the port number in the format **https://<deployment-name>.cloud.splunk.com:8089.</deployment-name> ** The default port number is 8089, which is required for hosted Splunk, also. For example: **https://mycompany.splunkcloud.com:8089**.
   
   ![](../static/connect-to-monitoring-and-logging-systems-20.png)
   

Splunk APIs require that you authenticate with a non-SAML account. To access your Splunk Cloud deployment using the Splunk REST API and SDKs, submit a support case requesting access on the Support Portal. For managed deployments, Splunk Support opens port 8089 for REST access. You can specify a range of IP addresses to control who can access the REST API. For self-service deployments, Splunk Support defines a dedicated user and sends you credentials that enable that user to access the REST API. For information see [Using the REST API with Splunk Cloud](http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/7.2.0/RESTTUT/RESTandCloud).

Ensure that the Splunk user account used to authenticate Harness with Splunk is assigned to a role that contains the following REST-related capabilities:

* Search.
* Access to the indexes you want to search.

In the following example we've created a new Splunk role named **Harness User**, and assigned it search capability:

![](../static/connect-to-monitoring-and-logging-systems-22.png)

We've given this role access to **All non-internal indexes**. However, we could restrict the access to only the few relevant indexes:

![](../static/connect-to-monitoring-and-logging-systems-23.png)

1. In the **Username** field, enter the username of your Splunk account.
2. In **Password** field, you can choose **Create or Select a secret.**


:::note
For secrets and other sensitive settings, select or create a new [Text Secret.](../../Secrets/2-add-use-text-secrets.md)

:::

1. Click **Connect and Save**. The Setup Delegates settings appear.
2.  You can choose **Connect via any available delegate** or **Connect only via delegates which has all of the following tags.** If you select a Delegate, Harness will always use that Delegate for this Connector.
3.  Click **Save and Continue**.
4.  Once the Test Connection succeeds, click **Finish**. Splunk is listed under the list of Connectors.

### Step: Add Google Cloud Operations (formerly Stackdriver)


:::note
For details on settings and permissions, see [Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Connector Settings Reference](../Cloud-providers/ref-cloud-providers/gcs-connector-settings-reference.md).

:::

Google Cloud Metrics and Google Cloud Logs are supported with GCP connector. See [Add a GCP Connector](../Cloud-providers/connect-to-a-cloud-provider.md#step-add-a-gcp-connector).

The following roles must be attached to the account used to connect Harness and Google Cloud Operations as a Google Cloud Provider:

* **Stackdriver Logs** - The minimum role requirement is **logging.viewer**
* **Stackdriver Metrics** - The minimum role requirements are **compute.networkViewer** and **monitoring.viewer**.
