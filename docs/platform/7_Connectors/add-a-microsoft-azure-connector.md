This topic explains how to connect Harness to the Microsoft Azure cloud. Using this Connector, you can pull Azure artifacts and deploy your applications to Azure using Harness.

Using Harness **Cloud Cost Management (CCM)**? See [Set Up Cloud Cost Management for Azure](../../cloud-cost-management/1-onboard-with-cloud-cost-management/set-up-cloud-cost-management/set-up-cost-visibility-for-azure.md).

### Before you begin

* [Learn Harness' Key Concepts](../../getting-started/learn-harness-key-concepts.md)
* [CD Pipeline Basics](../../continuous-delivery/onboard-cd/cd-concepts/cd-pipeline-basics.md)

### Limitations

* Currently, the Microsoft Azure Cloud Connector is for: ACR, AKS, Web Apps, and Virtual Machines for Traditional (SSH) deployments. Support for other services such as ARM and Blueprint are coming soon.
* To use an AKS cluster for deployment, the AKS cluster must have local accounts enabled (AKS property `disableLocalAccounts=false`).

### Visual Summary

The following example shows how to connect Harness to Azure using the Azure Cloud Connector and an Azure App registration.

### Review: Permissions

This section assumes you're familiar with Azure RBAC. For details, [Assign Azure roles using the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal) from Azure.

This graphic from Azure can be helpful as a reminder of how Azure manages RBAC:

![](./static/add-a-microsoft-azure-connector-64.png)

For security reasons, Harness uses an application object and service principal rather than a user identity. The process is described in [How to: Use the portal to create an Azure AD application and service principal that can access resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal) from Azure.

### AKS Cluster Setup Requirements

* AKS managed AAD (enabled or disabled).
* Kubernetes RBAC enabled.
* Azure RBAC (enabled or disabled).
	+ See **Deployments (CD)** in [Kubernetes Cluster Connector Settings Reference](ref-cloud-providers/kubernetes-cluster-connector-settings-reference.md).
* AKS property `disableLocalAccounts` (enabled or disabled).

##### Permissions List

We cover the roles needed for Azure services in later sections. In this section, we provide the permissions needed in case you want to use them with a custom role.

The following permissions (actions) are necessary for any user (Service Principal or Managed Identity):

* Service Principal and/or Managed Identity Azure permissions (these are necessary regardless if you are using Kubernetes RBAC or Azure RBAC):
	+ Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/read
	+ Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/builds/read
	+ Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/metadata/read
	+ Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/pull/read
	+ Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/read
	+ Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/listClusterUserCredential/action
	+ Microsoft.Resource/subscriptions/resourceGroup/read
* For Helm deployments, the version of Helm must be >= 3.2.0 (the Harness `HELM_VERSION_3_8_0` feature flag must be activated).
* Pod Assigned Managed Identity and System Assigned Managed Identity cannot be used for the same cluster.

Here is the JSON for creating a custom role with these permissions (replace `xxxx` with the role name, subscription Id, and resource group Id):


```
{  
    "id": "/subscriptions/xxxx/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/xxxx",  
    "properties": {  
        "roleName": "xxxx",  
        "description": "",  
        "assignableScopes": [  
            "/subscriptions/xxxx/resourceGroups/xxxx"  
        ],  
        "permissions": [  
            {  
                "actions": [],  
                "notActions": [],  
                "dataActions": [

                    "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/configmaps/delete",  
                    "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/secrets/read",  
                    "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/secrets/write",  
                    "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/secrets/delete",  
                    "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/apps/deployments/read",  
                    "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/apps/deployments/write",  
                    "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/apps/deployments/delete",  
                    "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/events/read",  
                    "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/events/write",  
                    "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/events/delete",  
                    "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/namespaces/read",  
                    "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/nodes/read",  
                    "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/pods/read",  
                    "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/pods/write",  
                    "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/pods/delete",  
                    "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/services/read",  
                    "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/services/write",  
                    "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/services/delete",  
                    "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/apps/statefulsets/read",  
                    "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/apps/statefulsets/write",  
                    "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/apps/statefulsets/delete",  
                    "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/apps/replicasets/read",  
                    "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/apps/replicasets/write",  
                    "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/apps/replicasets/delete"  
                ],  
                "notDataActions": []  
            }  
        ]  
    }  
}
```
#### Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS) Roles

If you use Microsoft Azure Cloud Connector and Service Principal or Managed Identity credentials, you can use a custom role or the Owner role.

If you do not use a custom role, the **Owner** role must be assigned.

Here are the options for connecting Harness to your target AKS cluster:

* Install a [Kubernetes Delegate](../2_Delegates/delegate-guide/install-a-kubernetes-delegate.md) in the target AKS cluster and use it for authentication in a Harness [Kubernetes Cluster Connector](add-a-kubernetes-cluster-connector.md). The Harness Kubernetes Cluster Connector is platform-agnostic.
	+ You won't need to provide Microsoft Azure Service Principal or Managed Identity credentials.
* Install a [Kubernetes Delegate](../2_Delegates/delegate-guide/install-a-kubernetes-delegate.md) in the target AKS cluster and use it for authentication in a Harness **Microsoft Azure Cloud Connector**, as described in this topic.
	+ You'll need to provide the Microsoft Azure Environment.
	+ If you use a User Assigned Managed Identity, you will need to provide the Application (client) Id.
	+ If you use a System Assigned Managed Identity, you do not need to provide any Ids.
* Use a **Microsoft Azure Cloud Connector** and Service Principal or Managed Identity credentials, as described in this topic. In this option, the **Owner** role must be assigned.

#### Azure RBAC Example

Here's an example of Azure RBAC permissions used for System Assigned Managed Identity:


```
{  
    "id": "/subscriptions/xxxx/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/xxxx",  
    "properties": {  
        "roleName": "HarnessSysMSIRole",  
        "description": "",  
        "assignableScopes": [  
            "/subscriptions/xxxx/resourceGroups/xxxx"  
        ],  
        "permissions": [  
            {  
                "actions": [],  
                "notActions": [],  
                "dataActions": [  
                    "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/configmaps/read",  
                    "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/configmaps/write",  
                    "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/configmaps/delete",  
                    "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/secrets/read",  
                    "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/secrets/write",  
                    "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/secrets/delete",  
                    "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/apps/deployments/read",  
                    "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/apps/deployments/write",  
                    "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/apps/deployments/delete",  
                    "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/events/read",  
                    "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/events/write",  
                    "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/events/delete",  
                    "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/namespaces/read",  
                    "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/nodes/read",  
                    "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/pods/read",  
                    "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/pods/write",  
                    "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/pods/delete",  
                    "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/services/read",  
                    "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/services/write",  
                    "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/services/delete",  
                    "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/apps/statefulsets/read",  
                    "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/apps/statefulsets/write",  
                    "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/apps/statefulsets/delete",  
                    "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/apps/replicasets/read",  
                    "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/apps/replicasets/write",  
                    "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/apps/replicasets/delete"  
                ],  
                "notDataActions": []  
            }  
        ]  
    }  
}
```
#### Kubernetes RBAC Example

Here's an example of Kubernetes RBAC:


```
kind: Role  
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1  
metadata:  
  name: cdp-qa-deployer-role  
  namespace: default  
rules:  
  - apiGroups: ["", "apps"]  
    resources: ["pods", "configmaps", "deployments", "secrets", "events", "services",  "replicasets", "deployments/scale", "namespaces", "resourcequotas", "limitranges"]  
    verbs: ["get", "watch", "list", "create", "update", "patch", "delete"]  
  
---  
kind: RoleBinding  
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1  
metadata:  
  name: cdp-qa-deployer-role-binding  
  namespace: default  
roleRef:  
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io  
  kind: Role  
  name: cdp-qa-deployer-role  
subjects:  
  - kind: Group  
    namespace: default  
    name: <AD group id to which the SP and MSI users are assigned to>
```
### Azure Container Repository (ACR) Roles

If you do not use a custom role, the **Reader** role must be assigned. **This is the minimum requirement.**

![](./static/add-a-microsoft-azure-connector-65.png)
You must provide the **Reader** role in the role assignment at the **Subscription** level used by the Application (Client) Id entered in the Connector. The application needs permission to list **all** container registries.

Some common mistakes:

* If you put the **Reader** role in a different IAM section of Azure.
* If you provide only the **AcrPull** role instead of **Reader**. It might appear that the AcrPull role gives access to a specific registry, but Harness needs to list **all** registries.

Harness supports 500 images from an ACR repo. If you don't see some of your images you might have exceeded this limit. This is the result of an Azure API limitation.  
  
If you connect to an ACR repo via the platform agnostic [Docker Connector](ref-cloud-providers/docker-registry-connector-settings-reference.md), the limit is 100.

### Azure Web App Permissions

If you use Microsoft Azure Cloud Connector and Service Principal or Managed Identity credentials, you can use a custom role or the **Contributor** role. The Contributor role is the minimum requirement.

Below are the Azure RBAC permissions used for System Assigned Managed Identity permissions to perform Azure Web App deployments for container and non-container artifacts.


```
[  
                    "microsoft.web/sites/slots/deployments/read",  
                    "Microsoft.Web/sites/Read",  
                    "Microsoft.Web/sites/config/Read",  
                    "Microsoft.Web/sites/slots/config/Read",  
                    "microsoft.web/sites/slots/config/appsettings/read",  
                    "Microsoft.Web/sites/slots/*/Read",  
                    "Microsoft.Web/sites/slots/config/list/Action",  
                    "Microsoft.Web/sites/slots/stop/Action",  
                    "Microsoft.Web/sites/slots/start/Action",  
                    "Microsoft.Web/sites/slots/config/Write",  
                    "Microsoft.Web/sites/slots/Write",  
                    "microsoft.web/sites/slots/containerlogs/action",  
                    "Microsoft.Web/sites/config/Write",  
                    "Microsoft.Web/sites/slots/slotsswap/Action",  
                    "Microsoft.Web/sites/config/list/Action",  
                    "Microsoft.Web/sites/start/Action",  
                    "Microsoft.Web/sites/stop/Action",  
                    "Microsoft.Web/sites/Write",  
                    "microsoft.web/sites/containerlogs/action",  
                    "Microsoft.Web/sites/publish/Action",  
                    "Microsoft.Web/sites/slots/publish/Action"  
]
```
### Step 1: Add the Azure Cloud Connector

You can add the Azure Cloud Connector inline, when adding artifacts or setting up the target infrastructure for a deployment Pipeline stage, or you can add the Connector separately and use it whenever you need it.

To add the Connector separately, in your Account, Org, or Project **Connectors**, click **New Connector**.

Click **Azure**.

Enter a name for the Connector. Harness automatically creates the Id ([Entity Identifier](../20_References/entity-identifier-reference.md)) for the Connector. You can edit the Id before the Connector is saved. Once it is saved, it is immutable.

Add a Description and [Tags](../20_References/tags-reference.md) if needed.

Click **Continue**.

### Option: Credentials or Inherit from Delegate

In **Details**, you can select how you'd like Harness to authenticate with Azure.

#### Delegate

If you have a Harness Delegate installed in your Azure subscription (preferably in your target AKS cluster) you can select **Use the credentials of a specific Harness Delegate**.

For steps on installing a Delegate, see [Delegate Installation Overview](../2_Delegates/delegate-installation-overview.md).

![](./static/add-a-microsoft-azure-connector-66.png)
In **Environment**, select **Azure Global** or **US Government**.

In **Authentication**, select **System Assigned Managed Identity** or **User Assigned Managed Identity**.

See [Use managed identities in Azure Kubernetes Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/use-managed-identity) and [How to use managed identities with Azure Container Instances](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-managed-identity) from Azure.If you selected **User Assigned Managed Identity**, in **Client Id**, enter the Client Id from your Managed Identity.

![](./static/add-a-microsoft-azure-connector-67.png)
If you selected **User Assigned Managed Identity**, you can also use a [Pod Assigned Managed identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/use-azure-ad-pod-identity).

If you selected **System Assigned Managed Identity**, click **Continue**.

#### System Assigned Managed Identity Notes

* If you select **System Assigned Managed Identity** in the Harness Azure Connector, the identity used is actually AKS cluster predefined [Kubelet Managed Identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/use-managed-identity#summary-of-managed-identities).
* Kubelet Managed Identity (which has name format `<AKSName>-agentpool`) must have the **acrPull** permission on ACR (if used for image storage).
* [Control plane AKS Managed Identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/use-managed-identity#summary-of-managed-identities) (which has name format `<AKSName>`) must have the **Reader** permission on the AKS cluster itself.

#### Credentials

Using Azure credentials is covered in the following steps.

### Step 2: Gather the Required Information

In Microsoft Azure, you can find the information you need on the App registration **Overview** page:

![](./static/add-a-microsoft-azure-connector-68.png)
### Step 3: Environment

In **Environment**, select **Azure Global** or **US Government**.

### Step 4: Application (Client) Id

This is the **Application (Client) Id** for the Azure app registration you are using. It is found in the Azure Active Directory (AAD) **App registrations** or **Managed Identity**. For more information, see [Quickstart: Register an app with the Azure Active Directory v1.0 endpoint](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-v1-add-azure-ad-app) from Microsoft.

To access resources in your Azure subscription, you must assign the Azure App registration using this Application Id to a role in that subscription.

For more information, see [Assign the application to a role](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal#assign-the-application-to-a-role) and [Use the portal to create an Azure AD application and service principal that can access resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal) from Microsoft.

### Step 5: Tenant (Directory) Id

The **Tenant Id** is the ID of the Azure Active Directory (AAD) in which you created your application. This Id is also called the **Directory ID**. For more information, see [Get tenant ID](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal#get-tenant-id) and [Use the portal to create an Azure AD application and service principal that can access resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal) from Azure.

### Step 6: Secret or Certificate

Harness supports PEM files only. Currently, Harness does not support PFX files.In **Authentication**, select **Secret** or **Certificate**.

This is the authentication key for your application. This is found in **Azure Active Directory**, **App Registrations**. Click the App name. Click **Certificates & secrets**, and then click **New client secret**.

![](./static/add-a-microsoft-azure-connector-69.png)
(./static/add-a-microsoft-azure-connector-69.png)
You cannot view existing secret values, but you can create a new key. For more information, see [Create a new application secret](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal#create-a-new-application-secret) from Azure.

If you select **Secret**, create or use an existing [Harness Text Secret](../6_Security/2-add-use-text-secrets.md).

If you select **Certificate**, create or use an existing [Harness File Secret](../6_Security/3-add-file-secrets.md).

### Step 7: Delegates Setup

Select the Delegate(s) to use with this Connector.

Click **Save and Continue**.

In **Connection Test**, the connection is verified.

If you run into errors, make sure that your Delegate is running and that your credentials are valid. For example, check that the secret has not expired in your App registration.

### Review: Using ${HARNESS\_KUBE\_CONFIG\_PATH} with Azure

The Harness `${HARNESS_KUBE_CONFIG_PATH}` expression resolves to the path to a Harness-generated kubeconfig file containing the credentials you provided to Harness.

The credentials can be used by kubectl commands by exporting its value to the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable.

For example, you could use a Harness Shell Script step and the expression like this:


```
export KUBECONFIG=${HARNESS_KUBE_CONFIG_PATH} kubectl get pods -n default
```
Steps can be executed on any Delegate or you can select specific Delegates using the steps [Delegate Selector](../2_Delegates/delegate-guide/select-delegates-with-selectors.md) setting.

For Azure deployments, note the following:

* If the Azure Connector used in the Stage's **Infrastructure** uses Azure Managed Identity for authentication, then the Shell Script step must use a Delegate Selector for a Delegate running in AKS.
* If the Azure Connector used in the Stage's **Infrastructure** uses Azure Service Principal for authentication, then the Shell Script step can use any Delegate.
