Harness Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Connector connects your Harness account to a GCP account.

You add Connectors to your Harness Account and then reference them when defining resources and environments.


### Limitations

Harness supports GKE 1.19 and later.

If you use a version prior to GKE 1.19, please enable Basic Authentication. If Basic authentication is inadequate for your security requirements, use the [Kubernetes Cluster Connector](../add-a-kubernetes-cluster-connector.md).

### Kubernetes Role Requirements

If you are using the GCP Connector to connect to GKE, the GCP service account used for any credentials requires the **Kubernetes Engine Developer** and **Storage Object Viewer** permissions.

If you use a version prior to GKE 1.19, please enable Basic Authentication. If Basic authentication is inadequate for your security requirements, use the [Kubernetes Cluster Connector](../add-a-kubernetes-cluster-connector.md).

* For steps to add roles to your service account, see [Granting Roles to Service Accounts](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-roles-to-service-accounts) from Google. For more information, see [Understanding Roles](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles?_ga=2.123080387.-954998919.1531518087#curated_roles) from GCP.

Another option is to use a service account that has only the Storage Object Viewer permission needed to query GCR, and then use either an in-cluster Kubernetes Delegate or a direct [Kubernetes Cluster Connector](kubernetes-cluster-connector-settings-reference.md) with the Kubernetes service account token for performing deployment.

### GCS and GCR Role Requirements

For Google Cloud Storage (GCS) and Google Container Registry (GCR), the following roles are required:

* Storage Object Viewer (roles/storage.objectViewer)
* Storage Object Admin (roles/storage.objectAdmin)

See [Cloud IAM roles for Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/iam-roles) from GCP.

Ensure the Harness Delegate you have installed can reach to the GCR registry host name you are using in **Registry Host Name** (for example, gcr.io) and storage.cloud.google.com.

### Google Artifact Registry

For Google Artifact Registry, the following roles are required:

- Artifact Registry Reader
- Artifact Registry Writer

### Google Cloud Operations Suite (Stackdriver) Requirements

Most APM and logging tools are added to Harness as Verification Providers. For Google Cloud's operations suite (formerly Stackdriver), you use the GCP Connector.

##### Roles and Permissions

* **Stackdriver Logs** - The minimum role requirement is **Logs Viewer** (logging.viewer)**.**
* **Stackdriver Metrics** - The minimum role requirements are **Compute Network Viewer** (compute.networkViewer) and **Monitoring Viewer** (monitoring.viewer).

See [Access control](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/access-control) from Google.

### Proxies and GCP with Harness

If you are using a proxy server in your GCP account, but want to use GCP services with Harness, you need to set the following to not use your proxy:

* `googleapis.com`. See [Proxy servers](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/troubleshooting#proxy-server) from Google.
* The `token_uri` value from your Google Service Account. See [Creating service account keys](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys#creating_service_account_keys) from Google.

### GCP Connector Settings

#### Name

The unique name for this Connector.

#### ID

See [Entity Identifier Reference](../../20_References/entity-identifier-reference.md).

#### Description

Text string.

#### Tags

See [Tags Reference](../../20_References/tags-reference.md).

#### Service Account Key

Select or create a new [Harness Encrypted Text secret](../../6_Security/2-add-use-text-secrets.md) that contains the Google Cloud's Account Service Key File.

To obtain the Google Cloud's Account Service Key File, see [Creating and managing service account keys](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys) from Google (JSON is recommended).

Once you have the key file from Google, open it, copy it, and paste it into the Harness Encrypted Text secret.

Next, use that Harness Encrypted Text secret in **Service Account Key**.
