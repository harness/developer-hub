You can connect Harness to ServiceNow using a Harness ServiceNow Connector. This Connector allows you to approve and reject Pipeline steps.

### Before you begin

* [Learn Harness' Key Concepts](../../getting-started/learn-harness-key-concepts.md)

### Limitations

* Your ServiceNow account should ideally have the `admin` role. If this is not possible, it should have at least the `itil_admin` or `itil` role to create and modify tickets.
* Your account should also have the `import_admin` or `import_transformer` role to manage import set transform maps. For details, see ServiceNow's [Base System Roles](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/newyork-platform-administration/page/administer/roles/reference/r_BaseSystemRoles.html) documentation.
* Your ServiceNow REST API account must have permission to view tickets.

### Step: Add ServiceNow Connector

This topic assumes you have a Harness Project set up. If not, see [Create Organizations and Projects](../organizations-and-projects/create-an-organization.md).

You can add a Connector from any module in your Project in Project setup, or in your Organization, or Account Resources.

This topic shows you how to add a ServiceNow Connector to your Project.

Click **New Connector**, and then click **ServiceNow**. The ServiceNow Connector settings appear.
