You can connect Harness to ServiceNow using a Harness ServiceNow connector. This connector allows you to approve and reject pipeline steps.

### Important notes

* Your ServiceNow account should ideally have the `admin` role. If this is not possible, it should have at least the `itil_admin` or `itil` role to create and modify tickets.
* Your account should also have the `import_admin` or `import_transformer` role to manage import set transform maps. For details, see ServiceNow's [Base System Roles](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/newyork-platform-administration/page/administer/roles/reference/r_BaseSystemRoles.html) documentation.
* Your ServiceNow REST API account must have permission to view tickets.
* For information on client credentials with certificates, go to the [AD FS OpenID Connect/OAuth flows and Application Scenarios](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/overview/ad-fs-openid-connect-oauth-flows-scenarios#second-case-access-token-request-with-a-certificate-1).
* Harness supports private keys encoded in RSA (in PKCS8 format).
* Harness supports certificates in `X509` format.
* Permissions granted to this connector in ServiceNow depend on the configuration of the client application group.

### Add a ServiceNow connector

This topic assumes you have a Harness Project set up. If not, see [Create Organizations and Projects](../organizations-and-projects/create-an-organization.md).

You can add a Connector from any module in your project in project setup, or in your organization, or account resources.

This topic shows you how to add a ServiceNow connector to your project.

1. In **Project Setup**, click **Connectors**.

2. Click **New Connector**, and then click **ServiceNow**. The ServiceNow connector settings appear.

3. Enter **Name** for this connector.

   You can choose to update the **Id** or let it be the same as your ServiceNow connector's name. For more information, see [Entity Identifier Reference](../20_References/entity-identifier-reference.md).

4. Enter a **Description** and **Tags** for your connector.

5. Click **Continue**.
   
### Add details for the ServiceNow connector

1. In **ServiceNow URL**, enter the base URL by which your users will access ServiceNow. For example: `https://example.service-now.com`.

2. In **Authentication**, select one of the following: 
   - **Username and Password**
   - **ADFS Client Credentials with Certificate**


```mdx-code-block
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
```
```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="usernamepwd" label="Username and Password" default border-bottom-color="red">
```
To use a username and password for authentication, do the following:

1. Enter **Username**.
2. In **Password/API Key**, create a new password or API key or enter an existing one. For **API Key**, use a [Harness Text Secret](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/Security/add-use-text-secrets).
  

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="adfs" label="ADFS Client Credentials with Certificate">
```

To use ADFS credentials for authentication:
  
1. Select an existing secret or create one that has the resource identifier of ServiceNow configured in ADFS as its value for the **Resource ID** field.
2. Select an existing secret or create one that has the application (client) id assigned to your application by AD FS for the **Client ID** field.
   
```mdx-code-block
<img src={adfs_clientid} alt="adfs-clientid" height="150" width="400"/>
```

3. Select an existing encrypted file or create one that has the certificate for the **Certificate** field. This is a `X509` format certificate used for signing JWT tokens by your application.
4. In **Private Key**, create a new secret or choose an existing one that has the AD FS private key as the value. This key is the private RSA key corresponding to certificate uploaded in the **Certificate **field.
5. In **ADFS URL**, enter the base AD FS URL.
  
```mdx-code-block
<img src={adfs_settings} alt="adfs-settings" height="350" width="600"/>
```
  
```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```
3. Click **Continue**.
