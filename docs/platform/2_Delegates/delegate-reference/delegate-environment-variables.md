| `NEXT_GEN` | Indicates that this Delegate will register in [Harness NextGen](https://docs.harness.io/article/ra3nqcdbaf-compare-first-gen-and-next-gen).If it set to false, the Delegate will attempt to register in Harness FirstGen. | `- name: NEXT_GEN``value: "true"` |

| `DELEGATE_PROJECT_IDENTIFIER` | The Harness Project [Identifier](../../20_References/entity-identifier-reference.md) where the Delegate will register.Delegates at the account or Org-level do not have a value for this variable. | `- name: DELEGATE_PROJECT_IDENTIFIER``value: "myproject"` |
