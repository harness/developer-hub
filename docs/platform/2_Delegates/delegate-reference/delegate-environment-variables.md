| `DELEGATE_NAME` | The name of the Delegate. This is the name that will appear in Harness when the Delegate is registered.You can automate Delegate creation by omitting the name, and then have a script copying the Delegate YAML file and add a unique name to value for each new Delegate you want to register.See [Automate Delegate Installation](../delegate-guide/automate-delegate-installation.md). | `- name: DELEGATE_NAME``value: qa` |
| `NEXT_GEN` | Indicates that this Delegate will register in Harness NextGen(`true`) or FirstGen(`false`). | `- name: NEXT_GEN``value: "true"` |
