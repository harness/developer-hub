This topic describes how to delete a delegate from your Kubernetes cluster and Harness installation.

### Identify the delegate type

Harness Delegate is installed as a Kubernetes [Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/workload-resources/deployment-v1/) object**.** A legacy delegate, on the other hand, is installed as a Kubernetes [StatefulSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/workload-resources/stateful-set-v1/) object. This means that the process used to delete a legacy delegate differs from the process used to delete Harness Delegate.

You can verify the delegate you're using by looking at its manifest file or by running `kubectl get all -n harness-delegate-ng`.

To delete a legacy delegate, skip to the "Delete a legacy delegate" section.

### Delete a delegate

Use the following process to delete a delegate.

#### Step 1: Delete the deployment for the delegate

To delete a delegate from your Kubernetes cluster, you delete the **Deployment** object that represents its deployment.

`kubectl delete deployment -n harness-delegate-ng <Deployment name>`

Use the following command to retrieve a list of deployments:

`kubectl get deployments`

The deployment name is specified in the `metadata.name` field of the Kubernetes manifest you used to install the delegate.

```yaml
...  
apiVersion: apps/v1  
kind: Deployment  
metadata:  
  labels:  
    harness.io/name: doc-demos  
  name: doc-demos  
  namespace: harness-delegate-ng  
...
```
In this example, the `name` field is specified as `doc-demos.`

Next, delete the Updater **CronJob**:

`kubectl delete cronjob -n harness-delegate-ng <Deployment name>-upgrader-job`

For example, if the **Deployment** name is `quickstart-delegate`:

`kubectl delete cronjob -n harness-delegate-ng quickstart-delegate-upgrader-job`

#### Step 2: Delete the delegate in Harness

Locate the delegate in the Harness account/Project/Org, click more options (⋮), and then click **Delete**.

### Delete replica pods

Deleted replica pods unregister and clear out during shutdown after they complete all running tasks if the graceful shutdown period is sufficient. The grace period is configurable. For more information on graceful shutdown, go to [Graceful delegate shutdown](/docs/platform/2_Delegates/delegate-concepts/graceful-delegate-shutdown-process.md).

If you do not delete the delegate in the UI, Harness automatically removes it after six hours. 

### Delete a legacy delegate

Use the following process to delete a Legacy Delegate.

#### Step 1: Delete the StatefulSet for the delegate

To delete a legacy delegate from your Kubernetes cluster, you delete the **StatefulSet** object that represents its deployment.

A **StatefulSet** resource is ensures that the desired number of pods are running and available at all times. If you delete a pod that belongs to a **StatefulSet** without deleting the **StatefulSet** itself, the pod is recreated.

For example, you can use the following command to delete the **StatefulSet** that created a delegate pod named `quickstart-vutpmk-0`:

`$ kubectl delete statefulset -n harness-delegate-ng quickstart-vutpmk`

The name of the delegate pod includes the name of the **StatefulSet** followed by the pod identifier `-0`.

#### Step 2: Delete the delegate in Harness

Locate the delegate in the Harness account/Project/Org, click more options (⋮), and then click **Delete**.
