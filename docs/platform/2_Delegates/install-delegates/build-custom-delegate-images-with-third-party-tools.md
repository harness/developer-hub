title: Build custom delegate images with third-party tools
description: This document explains how to build and host custom delegate images that include the tools you select.

---

Harness Manager installs and configures delegates with the binaries that most CI/CD pipelines require. In some cases, however, a preconfigured image isn’t the right fit. For example, preconfigured images can:

* Introduce the vulnerabilities of the binaries they include.
* Restrict you to the use of the included third-party tools and versions.

This document explains how you can:

* Build and host a custom delegate image that includes the tools you select.
* Use your custom delegate in CI/CD pipelines.

:::info note
Delegates with an immutable image type (image tag `yy.mm.xxxxx`) include non-root user privileges and are compatible with OpenShift. For information on delegate types, go to [Delegate image types](/docs/platform/delegates/delegate-concepts/delegate-image-types).
:::

### Select the delegate image

You can build on either of the following Harness-provided images.

| **Image** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Harness Delegate Docker image | A publicly available Docker image providing Harness Delegate. |
| Harness Minimal Delegate Docker image | A minimal delegate image available in Docker Hub at <https://hub.docker.com/r/harness/delegate/tags>. |

Use the last published `yy.mm.xxxxx` version of the minimal image from the Docker repository.

### Build the delegate image

When you build a custom delegate image, you modify the image you select with user privileges and binaries. This section explains the build script used for the process. In this example, the script builds a custom image for deployment by Kubernetes and by Terraform.

The first lines of the script provide information about the base image and user privileges. This example uses the minimal image with delegate minor version 77029.


```
FROM harness/delegate:22.10.77029.minimal  
USER root
```
The delegate container is granted root user privileges.

The first `RUN` block installs or updates the `unzip` and `yum-utils` tools. The `--nodocs` option prevents the installation of documentation on the image.


```
RUN microdnf update \  
  && microdnf install --nodocs \  
    unzip \  
    yum-utils
```
The second `RUN` block uses the `yum` utility to create a configuration file for the HashiCorp repository, and then uses the `microdnf` package manager to install the required Terraform components:


```
RUN yum-config-manager --add-repo https://rpm.releases.hashicorp.com/RHEL/hashicorp.repo \  
  && microdnf install -y terraform   
```
The final `RUN` block retrieves the Kubernetes `kubectl` command-line tool that is required to manipulate clusters. The Linux `chmod +x` instruction makes the utility executable:


```
RUN mkdir /opt/harness-delegate/tools && cd /opt/harness-delegate/tools \  
  && curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl> -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl" && chmod +x kubectl 
```
  

The `ENV` instruction defines the Linux `$PATH` environment variable that provides the location of the tools to be installed:


```
ENV PATH=/opt/harness-delegate/tools/:$PATH
```

The final instruction switches the user back to `harness` to ensure the custom image does not run as root:

```
USER harness
```
The complete script is as follows:

```
FROM harness/delegate:22.10.77029.minimal  
USER root  
  
RUN microdnf update \  
  && microdnf install --nodocs \  
    unzip \  
    yum-utils  
  
RUN yum-config-manager --add-repo https://rpm.releases.hashicorp.com/RHEL/hashicorp.repo \  
  && microdnf install -y terraform     
  
RUN mkdir /opt/harness-delegate/tools && cd /opt/harness-delegate/tools \  
  && curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl" && chmod +x kubectl   
  
ENV PATH=/opt/harness-delegate/tools/:$PATH  

USER harness
```
### Upload the image to Docker Hub

The next step is to upload your custom image to Docker Hub. For information on working with Docker repositories, go to [Manage repositories](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/repos/) in the Docker documentation.

### Modify the delegate manifest

Before you can deploy a delegate, you must:

* Update the image path to the repository location of the custom image.
* Suspend delegate auto-upgrade functionality.

Delegate auto-upgrade is not compatible with custom images.

### Upgrade the image path

Open the delegate manifest file and locate the container `spec` (`spec.containers`). Change the image path to reflect the repository location of your uploaded image as shown in the following YAML.


```
 spec:  
     terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 600  
     restartPolicy: Always  
     containers:  
     - image: example/org:custom-delegate  
       imagePullPolicy: Always  
       name: delegate  
       securityContext:  
         allowPrivilegeEscalation: false  
         runAsUser: 0   
```
   

For purposes of this example, the image was uploaded to `example/org:custom-delegate`.

### Suspend delegate auto-upgrade

Before you deploy a custom delegate, you must suspend its auto-upgrade functionality. This step prevents your image from being automatically upgraded and the installed binaries removed. 

To suspend auto-upgrade, in the delegate manifest, locate the `CronJob` resource. In the resource `spec`, set the `suspend` field to `true` as shown in the following YAML:


```
apiVersion: batch/v1beta1  
kind: CronJob  
metadata:  
 labels:  
   harness.io/name: custom-del-upgrader-job  
 name: custom-del-upgrader-job  
 namespace: harness-delegate-ng  
spec:  
 suspend: true  
 schedule: "0 */1 * * *"  
 concurrencyPolicy: Forbid  
 startingDeadlineSeconds: 20  

```
### Example manifest file

For the complete file, expand the following example.

### Deploy the delegate

You can deploy the delegate from Harness Manager or by applying the modified delegate manifest file to your cluster.

![](./static/build-custom-delegate-images-with-third-party-tools-08.png)

You can confirm the successful deployment and registration of the delegate in Harness Manager. Check the delegate information to ensure that auto-upgrade is not enabled.

### Create pipelines

You can use your registered delegate to run Kubernetes and Terraform pipelines.

For information about creating a Kubernetes pipeline, go to [Kubernetes deployment tutorial](/docs/continuous-delivery/deploy-srv-diff-platforms/kubernetes/kubernetes-cd-quickstart).

For information about creating a Terraform Plan, go to [Provision with the Terraform Apply Step](/docs/continuous-delivery/cd-infrastructure/terraform-infra/run-a-terraform-plan-with-the-terraform-apply-step/).
