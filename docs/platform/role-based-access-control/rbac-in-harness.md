Role-based access control (RBAC) lets you control who can access your resources and what actions they can perform on the resources. To do this, a Harness account administrator assigns resource-related permissions to members of user groups.

Using RBAC helps you:

- Ensure users can only access the information and resources necessary to perform their tasks. This reduces the risk of security breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive data.
- Create systematic, repeatable permissions assignments. RBAC saves time and increases efficiency for administrators who otherwise have to manage access for individual user accounts. You can quickly add and change roles, as well as implement them across APIs.
- Increase accountability by clearly defining who has access to which resources and information. This makes it easier to track and audit user activities, helping to identify and prevent misuse or abuse of access privileges.
- More effectively comply with regulatory and statutory requirements for confidentiality and privacy. It helps you enforce privacy and data protection policies.

Before configuring RBAC in Harness, you should have an understanding of:

* [Harness' key concepts](../../get-started/key-concepts.md)
* [Creating organizations and projects](../organizations-and-projects/create-an-organization.md)
* The functionality of the modules in your Harness account.

The video below gives an overview of RBAC in Harness.

## Permissions hierarchy (scopes)

The Harness Platform has a three-level hierarchical structure. The three levels, or scopes, are **Account**, **Organization** (Org), and **Project**.

You can configure permissions for each scope. This helps you delegate responsibilities to different teams and efficiently organize and manage your resources by providing granular access control that is flexible, scalable, and easy to manage.

The **Account** scope is the highest level. It is your Harness account and it encompasses all the resources within your Harness subscription. It provides a way to manage billing, user authentication, and global settings for all the organizations and projects within the account. Users with account-level permissions can manage the account-level settings, including billing, subscription, and SSO configuration. Resources, such as connectors, created at the account scope are available for use in all the organizations and projects within that account.

The **Organization** scope contains related projects, resources, and users within a specific domain or business unit. It provides a way to manage resources and permissions specific to a particular organization, as separate from other areas of the account. Users with org-level permissions can manage organization-level settings, including the creation of projects and user groups in the org, and assigning access policies to those user groups. Resources created at the organization scope are available for use in all projects within that organization, but aren't available outside that org.

The **Project** scope contains related resources, such as apps, pipelines, and environments. It provides a way to manage resources and permissions specific to a particular project, as separate from the larger org (business unit) and account. Users with project-level permissions can manage project-level settings, including the creation of pipelines, environments, and infrastructure definitions. Resources created at the project scope are only available in that project.

```mermaid

    A[Account] --> B(Organization)
    A[Account] --> C(Organization)
    B --> D[Project]
    B --> E[Project]
    C --> F[Project]
    C --> G[Project]
```

The scope at which you create resources depends on the level of control and visibility you require. For example, if you create a connector at the account scope, it is available to all organizations and projects within the account. However, if you create a connector at the organization scope, it is only available to that organization and any projects under that organization. It is not available at the account scope or to other organizations. This lets you control access to your resources more effectively and prevent unauthorized access.

To learn about organizations and projects, go to [Create Organizations and Projects](/docs/platform/organizations-and-projects/create-an-organization.md).

## RBAC components

Harness RBAC uses **Principals**, **Resource Groups**, and **Roles** to control access.

* [Principals](#principals) are entities taking action in the system. These include users, user groups, and service accounts.
* [Resource groups](#resource-groups) define what objects can be acted on. Objects include organizations, projects, pipelines, connectors, users, and more.
* [Roles](#roles) define what actions can be taken on objects. Actions include view, create, edit, delete, and so on.

You [assign roles and resource groups to principals](#role-binding). Roles and resource groups assigned to user groups are inherited by the users in those user groups.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Roles & Resource groups]-->C[User groups]
    A--->B
    A--->E[Service accounts]
    C-->B[Users]
```

### Principals

Principals are entities taking action in the system. You assign permissions and access, through roles and resource groups, to principals. Permissions define what actions a principal can take. Access defines which objects they can act on.

Principals include:

* [Users](/docs/platform/role-based-access-control/add-users): Individual users in Harness. Each user can belong to many user groups. You can assign roles and resource groups directly to users, or they can inherit these from user groups that they belong to.
* [User Groups](/docs/platform/role-based-access-control/add-user-groups): User groups contain multiple Harness users. Roles and resource groups are assigned to groups. The permissions and access granted by the assigned roles and resource groups are applied to all group members. You can create user groups at all [scopes](#permissions-hierarchy-scopes).
* [Service Accounts](/docs/platform/role-based-access-control/add-and-manage-service-account): Service accounts are like API users. You assign roles and resource groups to service accounts. Service accounts also have one or more [API keys](/docs/platform/automation/api/add-and-manage-api-keys), which authenticate and authorize remote services attempting to perform operations in Harness through Harness APIs.

### Resource groups

A resource group is a set of Harness resources that a principal can access. You can create resource groups at all [scopes](#permissions-hierarchy-scopes). Resource groups are assigned along with [roles](#roles) to principals. Roles grant permissions (what actions can be taken) and resource groups grant access (what objects can be acted on).

Resource groups either include **All Resources** (all resources of a given type) or **Named Resources** (specific, individual resources).

Harness has built-in resource groups at each scope, and you can create custom resource groups. For more information, go to [Manage resource groups](/docs/platform/role-based-access-control/add-resource-groups).

### Roles

Roles are sets of [permissions](/docs/platform/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference) that allow or deny specific operations on objects (resources). Roles are applied together with [resource groups](#resource-groups) to create a complete set of permissions and access.

Harness includes some built-in roles, and you can create your own custom roles, which are useful for limited and fine-grained access control. For more information, go to [Manage roles](/docs/platform/role-based-access-control/add-manage-roles).

Roles are scope-specific and can be created at all [scopes](#permissions-hierarchy-scopes).

## Role binding

Role binding refers to the process of assigning [roles](#roles) and [resource groups](#resource-groups) to [principals](#principal) (users, user groups, and service accounts). Role binding can be configured at all scopes.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Roles & Resource groups]-->C[User groups]
    A--->B
    A--->E[Service accounts]
    C-->B[Users]
```

<details>
<summary>Built-in role binding configurations</summary>

The following table describes the role bindings (permissions and access) that result from some combinations of built-in [roles](#roles) and [resource groups](#resource-groups). This table doesn't include module-specific built-in roles, such as CET Admin or Chaos Admin.

| Role | Resource Group | Resulting role binding |
| - | - | - |
| Account Admin | Account - All Resources Including Child Scopes | All permissions on all resources in the account and resources in organizations and projects under the account. |
| Account Admin | All Account Level Resources | All permissions on all resources at the account level only. |
| Account Viewer | Account - All Resources Including Child Scopes | View resources in the account and resources in organizations and projects under the account. |
| Account Viewer | All Account Level Resources | View resources at the account level only. |
| Organization Admin | Org - All Resources Including Child Scopes | All permissions on all resources in a specific organization and all projects under that organization. |
| Organization Admin | All Organization Level Resources | All permissions on all resources in a specific organization only. |
| Organization Viewer | Org - All Resources Including Child Scopes | View resources in a specific organization and resources in projects under that organization. |
| Organization Viewer | All Organization Level Resources | View resources in a specific organization only. |
| Project Admin | All Project Level Resources | All permissions on all resources within a specific project. |
| Project Viewer | All Project Level Resources | View resources in a specific project. |
| Pipeline Executor | All Project Level Resources | <ul><li>View resource groups, projects, users, user groups, and roles.</li><li>View and access secrets, connectors, environments, and services.</li><li>View and execute pipelines.</li></ul> |

### RBAC is additive

RBAC is an additive model; therefore, role and resource group assignments in Harness are additive. The total expanse of a principal's permissions and access is the sum of all the roles and resource groups from all user groups they belong to, as well as any roles and resource groups assigned directly to them as an individual user or service account.

:::caution Least privilege

It is important to follow the principle of least privilege (PoLP). This is a security principle that means users are granted the absolute minimum access/permissions necessary to complete their tasks and nothing more.

While Harness includes some built-in roles and resource groups, it is a good idea to create your own roles and resource groups as needed to ensure the least privilege.

:::

For example, assume a user has these role and resource group assignments:

* **Account Admin** role with **All Resources Including Child Scopes**. This is the most permissive combination of role and resource group. It grants all permissions on all resources throughout the entire account.
* **Organization Viewer** role with **All Resources Including Child Scopes**. This combination, by itself, grants the ability to view resources in a specific organization and resources in the projects under that organization.

Because the **Account Admin** combination includes the **Org Viewer** combination (and more), the user is effectively an account admin throughout the entire account. Assigning the **Org Viewer** role makes no difference to this user's access.

To control this user's access, you could change the resource group for the **Account Admin** role to **All Account Level Resources**. This would limit the **Account Admin** permissions to the resources at the account level only and remove admin access to lower scopes.

### Extend RBAC with ABAC

For more fine-grained control over access to connectors and environments, you can use [Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)](/docs/platform/role-based-access-control/attribute-based-access-control) as an extension of RBAC on your resource groups.

ABAC provides highly refined control by using rules to restrict access based on combinations of attributes, such as connector and environment type.

## Configure RBAC in Harness

Before configuring RBAC in Harness, make sure you understand the [RBAC components](#rbac-components) and [role binding](#role-binding).

### Required permissions

To configure RBAC in Harness, you must be an admin in the relevant account, organization, or project.

If your Harness account is new, you might need to contact Harness Support to get the first admin provisioned in your account.

If you are not an admin, you can configure some aspects of RBAC if you have the required granular permissions:

* Users: Requires **View**, **Manage**, and **Invite** permissions for **Users**.
* User groups: Requires **View** and **Manage** permissions for **User Groups**.
* Resource groups: Requires **View**, **Create/Edit**, and **Delete** permissions for **Resource Groups**.
* Roles: Requires **View**, **Create/Edit**, and **Delete** permissions for **Roles**.

### RBAC workflow summary

To configure RBAC in Harness, you must:

1. [Create roles](/docs/platform/role-based-access-control/add-manage-roles).
2. [Create resource groups](/docs/platform/role-based-access-control/add-resource-groups) and, optionally, apply [ABAC](./attribute-based-access-control.md).
3. [Create user groups](/docs/platform/role-based-access-control/add-user-groups), [create service accounts](/docs/platform/role-based-access-control/add-and-manage-service-account), and [add users](/docs/platform/role-based-access-control/add-users).
4. [Assign roles and resource groups](#role-binding) to users, user groups, and service accounts.
5. If you have not already done so, [configure authentication](/docs/platform/Authentication/authentication-overview).

:::tip Automated provisioning

You can create users and user groups directly in Harness, and you can use automated provisioning, including:

* [Okta SCIM](./provision-users-with-okta-scim.md)
* [Azure AD SCIM](./provision-users-and-groups-using-azure-ad-scim.md)
* [OneLogin SCIM](./provision-users-and-groups-with-one-login-scim.md)
* [Just-in-time provisioning](./provision-use-jit.md)

With automated provisioning, users and user groups are imported from your IdP, and then you [assign roles and resource groups](#role-binding) to the imported [principals](#principals) in Harness. You manage group metadata, group membership, and user profiles in your IdP, and you manage role and resource group assignments in Harness.

You can also create users and user groups directly in Harness, but any users or groups imported from your IdP must be managed in your IdP. For imported users and group, you can only change their role and resource group assignments in Harness.

### RBAC workflow examples

These examples walk through two specific RBAC configuration scenarios.

<details>
<summary>Example: Configure RBAC for account-level pipeline ownership</summary>

This example walks through an RBAC configuration that allows full control of pipelines and related resources (connectors, templates, and so on) across the entire account. This configuration uses a custom user group called *Pipeline Owners*, a custom role called *Pipeline Admin*, and a custom resource group called *All Pipeline Resources*.

The *All Pipeline Resources* resource group exists at the account scope and allows access to pipelines, secrets, connectors, delegates, environments, templates, and variables at the account level and in all organizations and projects under the account.

The *Pipeline Admin* role has the following permissions:

* Pipelines: View, create/edit, delete, and execute
* Secrets: View, create/edit, and access
* Connectors: View, create/edit, delete, and access
* Delegates: View and create/edit
* Environments: View, create/edit, and access
* Templates: View, create/edit, and access
* Variables: View and create/edit

#### Create the Pipeline Admin role

1. In Harness, select **Account Settings**, and then select **Access Control**.
2. Select **Roles** in the header, and then select **New Role**.
3. For **Name**, enter `Pipeline Admin`. **Description** and **Tags** are optional.
4. Select **Save**.
5. Select the following permissions:

   * For **Pipelines**, select **View**, **Create/Edit**, **Delete**, and **Execute**.
   * For **Environments**, and then select **View**, **Create/Edit**, and **Access**.
   * Under **Shared Resources**, select the following:
      * For **Templates**, select **View**, **Create/Edit**, and **Access**.
      * For **Secrets**, select **View**, **Create/Edit**, and **Access**.
      * For **Connectors**, select **View**, **Create/Edit**, **Delete**, and **Access**.
      * For **Variables**, select **View** and **Create/Edit**.
      * For **Delegates**, select **View** and **Create/Edit**.

6. Select **Apply Changes**.

For more information about roles and permissions, go to [Manage roles](./add-manage-roles.md) and the [Permissions reference](/docs/platform/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference).

#### Create the custom resource group

1. In Harness, select **Account Settings**, and then select **Access Control**.
2. Select **Resource Groups** in the header, and then select **New Resource Group**.
3. For **Name**, enter `All Pipeline Resources`. **Description**, **Tags**, and **Color** are optional.
4. Select **Save**.
5. For **Resource Scope**, select **All (including all Organizations and Projects)**. This means the resource group grants access to the specified resources at the account level and in all organizations and projects under the account.

   ![](./static/set-up-rbac-pipelines-41.png)

6. For **Resources**, select **Specified**, and then select the following resources:

   * Environments
   * Variables
   * Templates
   * Secrets
   * Delegates
   * Connectors
   * Pipelines

   ![](./static/set-up-rbac-pipelines-42.png)

7. Select **Save**.

For more information about creating resource groups, go to [Manage resource groups](./add-resource-groups.md).

#### Create the Pipeline Owners user group

1. In Harness, select **Account Settings**, and then select **Access Control**.
2. Select **User Groups** in the header, and then select ***New User Group**.
3. For **Name**, enter `Pipeline Owners`. **Description** and **Tags** are optional.
4. In **Add Users**, select users to add to the group.
5. Select **Save**.

For more information about user groups and users, go to [Manage user groups](./add-user-groups.md) and [Manage users](./add-users.md).

:::tip Automated provisioning

You can create user groups and users directly in Harness, and you can use automated provisioning, including:

* [Okta SCIM](./provision-users-with-okta-scim.md)
* [Azure AD SCIM](./provision-users-and-groups-using-azure-ad-scim.md)
* [OneLogin SCIM](./provision-users-and-groups-with-one-login-scim.md)
* [Just-in-time provisioning](./provision-use-jit.md)

When you use automated provisioning, users and user groups are imported from your IdP, and then you assign roles and resource groups to the imported [principals](#principals) in Harness. For imported users and groups, you manage group metadata, group membership, and user profiles in your IdP, and you manage their role and resource group assignments in Harness. You can also create users and user groups directly in Harness, but any users or groups imported from your IdP must be managed in your IdP.

For example, if you use Okta as your IdP, you could create a Pipeline Owners group in Okta and assign users to that group in Okta. When the Pipeline Owners group is first imported into Harness, the group and the group members are not associated with any roles or resource groups. You would [create the pipeline admin role](#create-the-pipeline-admin-role) and [create the custom resource group](#create-the-custom-resource-group) in Harness, and then [assign roles and resource groups](#assign-the-role-and-resource-group-to-the-user-group) to the user group. The group members inherit permissions and access from the role and resource group that is assigned to the user group.

:::

#### Assign the role and resource group to the user group

1. Harness, select **Account Settings**, and then select **Access Control**.
3. Select **User Groups** in the header, locate the **Pipeline Owners** group, and select **Manage Roles**.
4. Under **Role Bindings**, select **Add**.
5. For **Role**, select the **Pipeline Admin** role.
6. For **Resource Groups**, select the **All Pipeline Resources** group.
7. Select **Apply**.

For more information about assigning roles and resource groups, go to [Role binding](#role-binding).

<summary>Example: Configure RBAC to run pipelines in a specific project</summary>

This example walks through an RBAC configuration that provides only the ability to run pipelines in a specific project. This configuration uses a custom user group called *Project Pipeline Runners*, custom role called *Pipeline Runner*, and a custom resource group called *All Project Pipelines and Connectors*.

Because pipelines involve multiple resources, such as connectors, secrets, and variables, the *Pipeline Runner* role requires the following permissions:

* **Execute** permission for pipelines.
* **Access** permission for any resource types used in pipelines.

The *All Project Pipelines and Connectors* resource group exists at the project scope, and it only includes pipelines and resources related to pipelines (such as connectors). This restricts access to these specific resources within a specific project only.

#### Create the Pipeline Runner role

1. In Harness, go to the project where you want to configure RBAC.

   To configure RBAC for a specific project, you must navigate to that project first.

2. Select **Project Setup**, and then select **Access Control**.
3. Select **Roles** in the header, and then select **New Role**.
4. For **Name**, enter `Pipeline Runner`. **Description** and **Tags** are optional.
5. Select **Save**.
6. Select the following permissions:

   * For **Pipelines**, select **Execute**.
   * Under **Shared Resources**, select **Access** for **Connectors** and any other shared resources relevant to your pipelines, such as **Templates**, **Secrets**, **Variables**, or **Delegates**.

7. Select **Apply Changes**.

For more information about roles and permissions, go to [Manage Roles](./add-manage-roles.md) and the [Permissions reference](/docs/platform/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference).

#### Create the project resource group

1. In the same Harness project where you [created the Pipeline Runner role](#create-the-pipeline-runner-role), select **Project Setup**, and then select **Access Control**.
2. Select **Resource Groups** in the header, and then select **New Resource Group**.
3. For **Name**, enter `All Project Pipelines and Connectors`. **Description**, **Tags**, and **Color** are optional.
4. Select **Save**.
5. For **Resources**, select **Specified**, and then select **Pipelines**, **Connectors**, and any other shared resources relevant to your pipelines.

   After selecting resources, you can customize access further by configuring specific access for each resource type. For example, you can limit access to specific pipelines or connectors only.

6. Select **Save**.

In this example, the **Resource Scope** is locked to **Project only**, which means the resource group can only access the selected resources within this project. If your pipelines use connectors or other resources at a higher scope, you would need to configure RBAC at the account or org scope and then refine access by project. Similarly, if you wanted to create a user group that could run any pipeline in an organization or account, you would need to create the role, resource group, and user group at the account scope (by navigating to **Account Settings** and then selecting **Access Control**). Note that some refinement options, such as selecting specific pipelines, aren't available at higher scopes.

For more information about creating resource groups, go to [Manage resource groups](./add-resource-groups.md).

#### Configure the user group

1. In the same Harness project where you [created the Pipeline Runner role](#create-the-pipeline-runner-role), select **Project Setup**, and then select **Access Control**.
2. Select **User Groups** in the header, and then select ***New User Group**.
3. For **Name**, enter `Project Pipeline Runners`. **Description** and **Tags** are optional.
4. In **Add Users**, select users to add to the group.
5. Select **Save**.
6. Next to the **Project Pipeline Runners** group, select **Manage Roles**
7. Under **Role Bindings**, select **Add**.
8. For **Role**, select the **Pipeline Runner** role.
9. For **Resource Groups**, select the **All Project Pipelines and Connectors** group.
10. Select **Apply**.

For more information about user groups, users, and role/resource group assignments, go to [Manage user groups](./add-user-groups.md), [Manage users](./add-users.md), and [Role binding](#role-binding).
