The **Mark as Failed** button in the pipeline execution details page is used to mark any running pipeline as failed. Selecting this button sends a failure interrupt to all currently executing stages of the pipeline, triggering their failure strategies.

## Requirements

- You must have `Execute` pipeline permission to be able to mark a pipeline as failed.
- You must enable `Allow users to mark a running Step as failure` in your Harness account's [default settings](/docs/platform/settings/default-settings).
- This feature is behind the feature flag `CDS_MARK_PIPELINE_AS_FAILURE`. Contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io) to enable the feature.

## Marking a pipeline as failed

You can use the **Mark as Failed** option to mark a running pipeline as failed.

After marking a pipeline as failed, Harness fails `running` and `queued` stages. Completed stages aren't marked as failed.

:::info note
If a pipeline is configured with failure strategy like `Ignore Failure` or `Retry`, the execution might continue even after `Mark as Failure` is sent.

## Difference between marking a stage as failed and marking a pipeline as failed

You can mark an entire pipeline or a single stage as failed. 

Here's the difference between these options:

- If there is only one stage running when you mark either the stage or pipeline as failed, both options have the same impact.
- If parallel stages are running, then marking the *pipeline* as failed stops all running parallel stages. Marking one *stage* as failed only stops that stage.
