:::note

Currently, this feature is behind the feature flag `PL_ALLOW_TO_SET_PUBLIC_ACCESS`. Contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io) to enable the feature.

:::

Harness provides an option to allow public access to pipeline executions. When you activate this setting, you can then set your pipelines to public view. Pipeline executions for pipelines marked for public view will be accessible without the need to sign in to Harness. You can then share pipeline execution URLs.

:::info

When you mark a pipeline for public view, console logs for the pipeline's steps are also available.
