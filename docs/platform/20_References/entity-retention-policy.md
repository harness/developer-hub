This topic lists the Harness entity retention policy.

### Retention Policy Defaults

All Harness entities share the same retention policy. You can change the retention policy.

The default retention policy for deleted entities is 6 months. This includes entity Ids. 

### Reduce the Retention Policy

You can’t reduce the retention policy below the default of 6 months.

You can reduce a policy that is greater than 6 months.

If you reduce the retention policy, it effects existing entities. If existing entities current timestamp is longer than the newly defined policy they are removed from Harness.

### Extend the Retention Policy

You can extend the retention policy by contacting Harness. 

If you extend the retention policy:

* The new retention policy applies on all entities. You can’t have different policies per Project, Pipeline, etc.
* The new retention policy will affect all existing entities and their retention will be extended by the new policy. An extended retention policy does not affect newly created entities only.
