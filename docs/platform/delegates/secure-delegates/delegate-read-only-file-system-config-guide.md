This guide provides detailed instructions on how to configure the Harness Delegate to operate on a read-only file system for both Kubernetes/Helm and Docker deployments.

The Harness Delegate requires write access to specific directories to function correctly. By default, the delegate writes to two key directories:

- Temporary Directory (default: /tmp)

- Working Directory (default: /opt/harness-delegate/)

When deploying the delegate on a read-only file system, neither of these two locations is writable, so writable alternatives must be provided for these directories. The most common solution is to mount writable volumes in these locations, /tmp can be mounted directly, but the working directory needs to mount to a non-existing location and configure WORKING_DIR to point to that location. 

:::info note

This setup requires specific configurations in both Kubernetes and Docker deployments. If you encounter issues, contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io) for assistance.

## Prerequisites

Before configuring the delegate to run on a read-only file system, ensure that you meet the following prerequisites:

- **Delegate Version**: You are using a delegate version that supports running on a read-only file system. This functionality is available in versions >= `24.08.83702` and `24.08.83702.minimal`.

- **Writable Directories**: You have identified the directories that must remain writable, such as `/tmp` and the working directory.

## Configuring the Delegate for a Read-Only File System

Use the steps below to configure the Harness Delegate to run on a read-only file system.

To configure the delegate in a Docker container with a read-only file system, follow these steps:

1. **Mount Writable Volumes**:

    The delegate requires writable volumes for the `/tmp` and working directories. You can mount these volumes as tmpfs to allow writing.

    - **/tmp**: Mount as a writable volume.

    - **Working Directory**: Mount a writable volume to a non-existing location and configure the `WORKING_DIR` environment variable to point to this location.

    **Example: Docker Command:**

    ```
    docker run -d --cpus=1 --memory=2g --read-only \
    --mount type=tmpfs,destination=/writable \
    --mount type=tmpfs,destination=/tmp \
    -e WORKING_DIR="/writable" \
    -e DELEGATE_NAME=docker-delegate-ro \
    -e NEXT_GEN="true" \
    -e DELEGATE_TYPE="DOCKER" \
    -e ACCOUNT_ID=<account_id> \
    -e DELEGATE_TOKEN=<token> \
    -e DELEGATE_TAGS="" \
    -e MANAGER_HOST_AND_PORT=https://app.harness.io harness/delegate:24.08.83702.minimal
    ```

    **Explanation:**

    - `--read-only`: Enables the read-only file system.

    - `-e WORKING_DIR="/writable"`: Configures the working directory for the delegate.

    - `--mount type=tmpfs,destination=/writable`: Mounts an empty space for the working directory.

    - `--mount type=tmpfs,destination=/tmp`: Mounts an empty space for the tmp directory.

2. **Set Environment Variables**

    Ensure all required environment variables are properly set. This includes:

    - `DELEGATE_NAME`: The name of your delegate.

    - `NEXT_GEN`: Set to "true" to enable the next-generation delegate features.

    - `ACCOUNT_ID`: Your Harness account ID.

    - `DELEGATE_TOKEN`: Your delegate token for authentication.

3. **Verify the Deployment**

    After running the Docker container, verify that the delegate is functioning correctly:

    - Check the logs using `docker logs <container_id>`.

    - Ensure there are no permission errors related to the read-only file system.

    - Confirm that the delegate is registered and active in your Harness account.

To configure the delegate in a Kubernetes cluster with a read-only file system, follow these steps:

1. **Create the Deployment YAML**

    Start by creating a Kubernetes deployment YAML file with the necessary configurations. Ensure the delegate has writable volumes for its working directory and  `/tmp`:

    **Example YAML Configuration:**

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
    labels:
        harness.io/name: k8s-ro
    name: k8s-ro
    namespace: harness-delegate-ng
    spec:
    replicas: 1
    minReadySeconds: 120
    selector:
        matchLabels:
        harness.io/name: k8s-ro
    template:
        metadata:
        labels:
            harness.io/name: k8s-ro
        annotations:
            prometheus.io/scrape: "true"
            prometheus.io/port: "3460"
            prometheus.io/path: "/api/metrics"
        spec:
        terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 600
        restartPolicy: Always
        containers:
        - image: harness/delegate:24.08.83702.minimal
            imagePullPolicy: Always
            name: delegate
            securityContext:
            allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
            readOnlyRootFilesystem: true

            requests:
                cpu: "0.5"
                memory: "2048Mi"

            initialDelaySeconds: 10
            periodSeconds: 10
            failureThreshold: 3
            startupProbe:

            volumeMounts:
            - name: work-dir
            mountPath: /opt/harness-delegate/writable/
            - name: tmp-dir
            mountPath: /tmp
        volumes:
        - name: work-dir
          emptyDir: {}
        - name: tmp-dir
          emptyDir:
            medium: "Memory"
    ```

2. **Configure Security Context**

    Ensure the `securityContext` settings enable the read-only file system and non-root execution.

    **Example:**

    ```yaml
    securityContext:
    allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
    readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
    runAsNonRoot: true
    runAsUser: 1001
    ```

3. **Mount Writable Volumes**

    Mount the writable volumes for the working directory and `/tmp` to ensure the delegate can write necessary files.

    **Example:**
    ```yaml
    volumeMounts:
    - name: work-dir
    mountPath: /opt/harness-delegate/writable/
    - name: tmp-dir
    mountPath: /tmp
    volumes:
    - name: work-dir
    emptyDir: {}
    - name: tmp-dir
    emptyDir:
        medium: "Memory"
    ```

4. **Configure Environment Variables**

    Ensure all required environment variables are properly set in the deployment YAML.

    **Example**:
    ```
    name: WORKING_DIR
    value: "/opt/harness-delegate/writeable/"
    ```

5. **Deploy the Delegate**
    
    Apply the deployment YAML to your Kubernetes cluster to deploy the delegate.
    
    **Example:**
    ```
    kubectl apply -f delegate-deployment.yaml
    ```

6. **Verify the Deployment**
    
    After deploying the delegate, verify that it is functioning correctly:
    
    - Check the logs using `kubectl logs <pod_name> -n <namespace>`.
    
    - Ensure there are no permission errors related to the read-only file system.
    
    - Confirm that the delegate is registered and active in your Harness account.

:::info note

Kubernetes mounts /tmp inside RAM memory as tmpfs by default. It is recommended to do the same when mounting by specifying medium: "Memory".
