description: How to set up mTLS support
# sidebar_position: 40
---

mTLS is part of the TLS protocol, which allows the server to verify the authenticity of the client. To achieve that, the client has to provide a client certificate during the TLS handshake, which is verified by the server using a previously configured CA certificate.

Due to security reasons, every customer must create their own CA certificate and signed client certificates, and Harness hosts a dedicated mTLS endpoint (subdomain) for every account that has mTLS enabled.

Harness supports the following mTLS modes:

- LOOSE: Both non-mTLS and mTLS delegates are accepted.

- STRICT: Only mTLS delegates are accepted. Any non-mTLS delegates are blocked. 

:::info note
mTLS is an advanced feature. Contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io) to enable it.
:::

## Create a CA certificate and a client certificate

Harness does not create or distribute the CA and client certificates that are used for mTLS. You must set up the certificates and explicitly provide them to the delegate by mounting a Kubernetes secret.

:::caution Important note
Project-level certificates are not supported for mTLS delegates.

:::

In the following examples, OpenSSL is used to create the required certificates. For the `Subject`, use the text of your choice. It does not have to match the mTLS DNS name or contain `harness.io`. 

### Create a CA certificate

- Use the following OpenSSL comment to create a test CA certificate with no password and 25+ years of validity. You must provide the public portion of the CA certificate (ca.crt) to Harness to enable mTLS.

    `openssl req -x509 -sha256 -nodes -days 9999 -newkey rsa:2048 \ -subj "/O=Example ORG/CN=CA Cert" -keyout "ca.key" -out "ca.crt"`

### Create a client certificate

1. Create the configuration used to create the client certificate:

   ```text
    cat << EOF > "client.cnf"
    [req]
    default_bits = 2048
    prompt = no
    default_md = sha256
    x509_extensions = v3_req
    distinguished_name = dn
    
    [dn]
    O = Example ORG
    CN = Client

    [v3_req]
    # empty
    EOF
   ```

2. After the configuration file has been created, create a new certificate signing request together with the key pair:

    `openssl req -new -config "client.cnf" -nodes -out "client.csr" -keyout "client.key"`

3. Using the previously created CA certificate with the certificate signing request, create the final signed client certificate:

    `openssl x509 -req -sha256 -days 9999 -extfile client.cnf -extensions v3_req \ -CAcreateserial -CA "ca.crt" -CAkey "ca.key" \ -in "client.csr" -out "client.crt"`
    
   :::info note
   You provide the client.crt and client.key to the delegate YAML when you install the delegate.
   :::

4. After you create the certificates, provide the public cert of the CA certificate to Harness support. 
5. Provide a unique API prefix to the location where your mTLS endpoint is hosted. You can set any prefix for your directory path, but it must be unique.

   :::info note
   After this, Harness will perform the steps to enable the mTLS.

## Move delegates to mTLS

You can move existing delegates with an immutable image type (image tag `yy.mm.xxxxx`) to mTLS.

### Prerequisites for delegate migration

Before you migrate an existing delegate to an mTLS-enabled delegate, make sure that you meet the following prerequisites.

- The delegate must have an immutable image type (image tag _`yy.mm.xxxxx`_). For information on delegate types, go to [Delegate image types](/docs/platform/delegates/delegate-concepts/delegate-image-types).

- You must have access to the delegate YAML.

### Migrate a delegate to an mTLS-enabled Docker delegate

To migrate an existing delegate for mTLS support, you run a Docker command.

To migrate a delegate for mTLS support, do the following:

1. Copy the following example command.

   ```
   docker run -d --cpus=1 --memory=2g -u root -v Path/To/client.crt:/etc/mtls/client.crt -v Path/To/client.key:/etc/mtls/client.key \
     -e DELEGATE_NAME=docker-delegate \
     -e NEXT_GEN="true" \
     -e DELEGATE_TYPE="DOCKER" \
     -e ACCOUNT_ID=[your account id] \
     -e DELEGATE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PATH=/etc/mtls/client.crt \
     -e DELEGATE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_KEY_PATH=/etc/mtls/client.key \
     -e DELEGATE_TOKEN=********** \
     -e LOG_STREAMING_SERVICE_URL=https://<YOUR_FQDN>.agent.harness.io/log-service/ \
     -e MANAGER_HOST_AND_PORT=https://<YOUR_FQDN>.agent.harness.io harness/delegate:yy.mm.verno
   ```

   `-v`: Mounts your `client.crt` and `client.key` files to the delegate Docker container.
2. Update the `DELEGATE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PATH` to the location of `client.crt` inside the container. In this example, it's `/etc/mtls/client.crt`.
3. Update the `DELEGATE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_KEY_PATH` to the location of `client.key` inside the container. In this example, it's `/etc/mtls/client.key`.
4. Update the `MANAGER_HOST_AND_PORT` value to `https://<YOUR_FQDN>.agent.harness.io`.
5. Update the `LOG_STREAMING_SERVICE_URL` value to `https://<YOUR_FQDN>.agent.harness.io/log-service/`.
6. Run the command.

### Migrate a delegate to an mTLS-enabled Kubernetes delegate

To migrate an existing delegate for mTLS support, you must update the delegate YAML. For an example Kubernetes manifest, go to [Sample Kubernetes manifest](https://github.com/harness/delegate-kubernetes-manifest/blob/main/harness-delegate.yaml).

To migrate a delegate for mTLS support, do the following:

1. In your delegate YAML, add the `client.crt` and `client.key` fields before the `Deployment` section.

   ```yaml
    
     ---

    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: PUT_YOUR_DELEGATE_NAME-account-token
      namespace: harness-delegate-ng
    type: Opaque
    data:
      # Replace the values below with base64 encoded PEM files or mount an existing secret.
      client.crt: "{CERT}"
      client.key: "{KEY}"
    
    ---
   ```

2. In the `Deployment` section, update the `name:` value from `MANAGER_HOST_AND_PORT` to `https://<YOUR_FQDN>.agent.harness.io`.

3. Update the `LOG_STREAMING_SERVICE_URL` value to `https://<YOUR_FQDN>.agent.harness.io/log-service/`

4. Add the two environment variables below.

   ```yaml
   - name: DELEGATE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PATH
     value: "/etc/mtls/client.crt"
   - name: DELEGATE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_KEY_PATH
     value: "/etc/mtls/client.key"
   ```

5. Add the `volumeMounts` and `volumes` sections under `containers`.

   ```yaml
      volumeMounts:
      - name: client-certificate
        mountPath: /etc/mtls
        readOnly: true
        value: "/etc/mtls/client.crt"
   volumes:
   - name: client-certificate
     secret:
       secretName: kubernetes-delegate-client-certificate
   ```

6. Add the client certificate and key section in the `ConfigMap` `upgrader-config`, then add your `managerHost` and port. 

   ```yaml
   ---

   apiVersion: v1
   kind: ConfigMap
   metadata:
     name: PUT_YOUR_DELEGATE_NAME-upgrader-config
     namespace: harness-delegate-ng
   data:
     config.yaml: |
       mode: Delegate
       dryRun: false
       workloadName: PUT_YOUR_DELEGATE_NAME
       namespace: harness-delegate-ng
       containerName: delegate
       clientCertificateFilePath: /etc/mtls/client.crt
       clientCertificateKeyFilePath: /etc/mtls/client.key
       delegateConfig:
         accountId: PUT_YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID
         managerHost: PUT_YOUR_MANAGER_ENDPOINT
   ---
   ```

7. In the `CronJob` section, add your certificate `volumes` and `volumeMount`.

   ```yaml
   ---

   apiVersion: batch/v1
   kind: CronJob
   metadata:
     labels:
       harness.io/name: upgrader-job
     name: PUT_YOUR_DELEGATE_NAME-upgrader-job
     namespace: harness-delegate-ng
   spec:
     schedule: "0 */1 * * *"
     concurrencyPolicy: Forbid
     startingDeadlineSeconds: 20
     jobTemplate:
       spec:
         template:
           spec:
             serviceAccountName: upgrader-cronjob-sa
             restartPolicy: Never
             containers:
             - image: harness/upgrader:latest
               name: upgrader
               imagePullPolicy: Always
               envFrom:
               - secretRef:
                   name: PUT_YOUR_DELEGATE_NAME-upgrader-token
               volumeMounts:
                 - name: config-volume
                   mountPath: /etc/config
                 - name: client-certificate
                   mountPath: /etc/mtls
                   readOnly: true
             volumes:
               - name: config-volume
                 configMap:
                   name: PUT_YOUR_DELEGATE_NAME-upgrader-config
               - name: config-certificate
                 secret:
                   secretName: kubernetes-delegate-client-certificate
   ```

8. Save and deploy the manifest.
