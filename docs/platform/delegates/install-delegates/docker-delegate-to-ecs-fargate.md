# Deploy a Docker delegate to Amazon ECS or AWS Fargate

Harness Delegate carries out the tasks in your Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) pipelines. The delegate is a software component that installs in your environment and registers with Harness Manager. The delegate connects to Harness Manager for the assignment and completion of CI/CD tasks.

You can use Harness NextGen to deploy a Docker delegate to Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) or AWS Fargate. This tutorial steps through the process of installing the delegate into an ECS cluster as an ECS service. The installed delegate connects to your AWS resources.

:::info note
Delegate scope for a delegate for Amazon ECS is based on the token you use.

## Deploy a delegate to Amazon ECS 

Use the following steps to deploy a delegate to an Amazon ECS cluster. This process requires a delegate an immutable image. For more information, go to [Delegate image types](/docs/platform/Delegates/delegate-concepts/delegate-image-types).

:::info note
You can also use a Terraform module to deploy a delegate. For more information, go to [Deploy a delegate using Terraform](#deploy-a-delegate-using-terraform).

### Create the cluster

Create an ECS cluster. Use an EC2 instance type with networking. 

For more information, go to [EC2 instance types](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/) in the AWS documentation.

### Create the task definition

1. Copy the following task `spec` into a file. Save the file as `task-spec.json`.

   ```json
     {
       "containerDefinitions": [
         {
           "cpu": 1,
           "environment": [
             {
               "name": "ACCOUNT_ID",
               "value": "<ACCOUNT_ID>"
             },
             {
               "name": "DELEGATE_TOKEN",
               "value": "<DELEGATE_TOKEN>"
             },
             {
               "name": "DELEGATE_TYPE",
               "value": "DOCKER"
             },
             {
               "name": "INIT_SCRIPT",
               "value": ""
             },
             {
               "name": "DEPLOY_MODE",
               "value": "KUBERNETES"
             },
             {
               "name": "MANAGER_HOST_AND_PORT",
               "value": "<MANAGER_HOST_AND_PORT>"
             },
             {
               "name": "DELEGATE_NAME",
               "value": "<DELEGATE_NAME>"
             },
             {
               "name": "LOG_STREAMING_SERVICE_URL",
               "value": "<LOG_STREAMING_SERVICE_URL>"
             },
            {
               "name": "DELEGATE_TAGS",
               "value": ""
             },
   
             {
               "name": "NEXT_GEN",
               "value": "true"
             }
            ],
           "memory": 2048,
           "image": "harness/delegate:22.12.77802",
           "essential": true,
           "hostname": "<DELEGATE_HOST>",
           "name": "<DELEGATE_NAME>"
         }
       ],
         "memory": "2048",
         "requiresCompatibilities": [
         "EC2"
       ],
     
       "cpu": "1024",
       "family": "harness-delegate-task-spec"
     }
   ```

2. Enter the fields of the task definition as follows:

   | **Field** | **Description** |
   | :-- | :-- |
   | `ACCOUNT_ID` | Your Harness account ID. |
   | `DELEGATE_TOKEN` | The delegate token stored in your Harness account. |
   | `MANAGER_HOST_AND_PORT` | Information about your manager host. This depends on the Harness production cluster you use: Prod1: https://app.harness.io, Prod2: https://app.harness.io/gratis, or Prod3: https://app3.harness.io. |
   | `DELEGATE_NAME` | The name you gave your delegate. This is usually the name you specified during delegate installation. |
   | `IMAGE` | Use the most recent delegate image from https://hub.docker.com/r/harness/delegate/\{tags}. The correct image uses an image tag in the following format: `harness/delegate:yy.mm.xxxxx`. |
   | `LOG_STREAMING_SERVICE_URL` | The URL of your log streaming service. This depends on the Harness production cluster you use: MANAGER_HOST_AND_PORT/log-service/ |

### Create your services

Use the following steps to create a service.

1. Open AWS CLI. Use the following instruction to create your AWS services:

   ```
   ecs create-service --service-name <SERVICE_NAME> --task-definition
   ```
   
   Replace `service-name` with the unique name of your service. Replace `task-definition` with the task definition that the service runs. 
   
   For information on the specification of ECS service parameters, go to [`create-service`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ecs/create-service.html).
   
2. Use the following instruction to increase the count of replica pods to the desired number:

   ```
   harness-delegate-task-spec --cluster <CLUSTER_NAME> --desired-count 1
   ```
   
## Deploy a delegate to Amazon Fargate

Use the following steps to deploy a delegate to an Amazon Fargate cluster. This process requires a delegate with an immutable image. For more information, go to [Delegate image types](/docs/platform/Delegates/delegate-concepts/delegate-image-types).

### Create the cluster 

Create a cluster on Amazon Fargate. Use an instance type with networking.

For more information, go to [EC2 instance types](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/) in the AWS documentation.

### Create the task definition

Use the following steps to create a task definition. For information about task definitions in Amazon ECS, go to [Task definition template](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-definition-template.html).

1. Copy the following task `spec` into a file. Save the file as `task-spec.json`.

   ```json
    {
      "containerDefinitions": [
        {
          "cpu": 1,
          "environment": [
           {
              "name": "ACCOUNT_ID",
              "value": "<ACCOUNT_ID>"
            },
            {
              "name": "DELEGATE_TOKEN",
              "value": "<DELEGATE_TOKEN>"
            },
            {
              "name": "DELEGATE_TYPE",
              "value": "DOCKER"
            },
            {
              "name": "LOG_STREAMING_SERVICE_URL",
              "value": "<LOG_STREAMING_SERVICE_URL>"
            },
            {
              "name": "DELEGATE_TAGS",
              "value": ""
            },
            {
              "name": "INIT_SCRIPT",
              "value": ""
            },
            {
              "name": "DEPLOY_MODE",
              "value": "KUBERNETES"
            },
            {
              "name": "MANAGER_HOST_AND_PORT",
              "value": "<HOST>"
            },
            {
              "name": "DELEGATE_NAME",
              "value": "<DELEGATE_NAME>"
            },
            {
              "name": "NEXT_GEN",
              "value": "true"
            }
          ],
         "memory": 2048,
         "image": "harness/delegate:22.12.77802",
         "essential": true,
         "name": "ecs-delegate-im"
        }
      ],
      "executionRoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::<ACC_ID>:role/ecsTaskExecutionRole",
      "memory": "6144",
      "requiresCompatibilities": [
        "FARGATE"
      ],
      "networkMode": "awsvpc",
      "cpu": "1024",
      "family": "harness-delegate-task-spec"
    }
    ```

2. Edit the fields of the task definition as follows.

   | **Field** | **Description** |
   | :-- | :-- |
   | `ACCOUNT_ID` | Your Harness account ID. |
   | `DELEGATE_TOKEN` | The delegate token stored in your Harness account. |
   | `MANAGER_HOST_AND_PORT` | Information about your manager host. This depends on the Harness production cluster you use: Prod1: https://app.harness.io, Prod2: https://app.harness.io/gratis, or Prod3: https://app3.harness.io. |
   | `DELEGATE_NAME` | The name you gave your delegate. This is usually the name you specified during delegate installation. |
   | `IMAGE` | Use the most recent delegate image from https://hub.docker.com/r/harness/delegate/\{tags}. The correct image uses an image tag in the following format: `harness/delegate:yy.mm.xxxxx`. |
   | `LOG_STREAMING_SERVICE_URL` | The URL of your log streaming service. This depends on the Harness production cluster you use: MANAGER_HOST_AND_PORT/log-service/ |

### Create the service

1. Edit the `service.json` file as follows:

   ```json
   {
      "launchType": "FARGATE",
      "cluster": "<CLUSTER_NAME>",
      "serviceName": "<SERVICE_NAME>",
      "taskDefinition": "harness-delegate-task-spec",
      "desiredCount": 1,
      "loadBalancers": [],
      "networkConfiguration": {
        "awsvpcConfiguration": {
          "subnets": [
            "<SUBNET>"
          ],
          "securityGroups": [
            "SEC_GROUP"
          ],
          "assignPublicIp": "ENABLED"
        }
      },
      "platformVersion": "LATEST",
      "schedulingStrategy": "REPLICA",
      "enableECSManagedTags": true
    }
   ```
   
 2. After the service is created and modified, use the JSON files to register the task and service definitions.
 
 3. From AWS CLI, use the following instruction to register the task definition:
 
    ```
    aws ecs register-task-definition --cli-input-json file://task-spec.json
    ```
    
 4. Then register the service definition:
 
    ```
    aws ecs create-service --cli-input-json file://service.json
    ```

## Deploy a delegate using Terraform

The above steps to [deploy a delegate to ECS](#deploy-a-delegate-to-amazon-ecs) are also available in a Terraform module that you can reference directly or use as a starting point for your own automation. You can use an existing ECS cluster (EC2- or Fargate-based) or let the module create one for you.

To access the module, go to [Harness Community GitHub](https://github.com/harness-community/terraform-aws-harness-delegate-ecs-fargate).

```terraform
module "delegate" {
  source                    = "git::https://github.com/harness-community/terraform-aws-harness-delegate-ecs-fargate.git"
  name                      = "ecs"
  harness_account_id        = "<Harness account Id>"
  delegate_token_secret_arn = "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:012345678901:secret:harness/delegate-zBsttc"
  delegate_policy_arns      = [
    aws_iam_policy.delegate_aws_access.arn
  ]
  security_groups = [
    module.vpc.default_security_group_id
  ]
  subnets = module.vpc.private_subnets
}

module "vpc" {
  source  = "terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws"
  version = "~> 3.0"

  name = "this"
  cidr = "10.0.0.0/16"

  azs             = ["us-west-2a", "us-west-2b"]
  private_subnets = ["10.0.1.0/24", "10.0.2.0/24"]
  public_subnets  = ["10.0.4.0/24", "10.0.5.0/24"]

  enable_nat_gateway   = true
  single_nat_gateway   = true
  enable_dns_hostnames = true

  public_subnet_tags = {
    "type"                         = "public"
  }

  private_subnet_tags = {
    "type"                            = "private"
  }
}

resource "aws_iam_policy" "delegate_aws_access" {
  name        = "delegate_aws_access"
  description = "Policy for harness delegate aws access"

  policy = <<EOF
{
   "Version": "2012-10-17",
   "Statement": [
       {
           "Sid": "GetArtifacts",
           "Effect": "Allow",
           "Action": [
               "s3:*"
           ],
           "Resource": [
              "${aws_s3_bucket.this.arn}",
              "${aws_s3_bucket.this.arn}/*"
           ]
       }
   ]
}
EOF
}
```

## Limitations

This section details the specific limitations associated with using ECS-configured Docker delegates in Harness. Review these limitations to ensure seamless and secure deployment of your applications and services.

**ECS-configured Docker delegates do not auto-update**

If you are using a delegate configured through ECS, auto-update of the delegate is not supported.

**Concerns with auto-upgrading the delegate**

The convenience of automatic updates is obvious, but it raises certain security concerns. As delegates are updated, new binaries and tools may be introduced. There is no way to scan these additions, which can lead to potential vulnerabilities. Due to these concerns, Harness recommends using custom delegates for production use.

If you use the Docker delegate on AWS ECS Fargate, Harness recommends that you manually update the delegate on a regular cadence, either every 3 or 6 months. This ensures a balance between security and feature updates.

**Limitations with Docker delegate on an AWS ECS Fargate-backed instance**

When operating ECS delegates on AWS Fargate, it's critical to note that AWS Fargate will terminate the delegate if the tasks running on the delegate exceed the infrastructure's specified limits. This is a limitation inherent in using infrastructure not owned by the customer. Harness Delegate cannot circumvent this restriction. However, ECS delegates operating on an EC2 instance do not have this issue.

To avoid this limitation, consider using Kubernetes delegates. In this setup, the infrastructure and associated YAML definitions address these issues.
