Harness Manager installs and configures delegates with the binaries that most CI/CD pipelines require. In some cases, however, a preconfigured image isn't the right fit. For example, preconfigured images can:

* Introduce the vulnerabilities of the binaries they include.
* Restrict you to the use of the included third-party tools and versions.

This document explains how you can:

* Build and host a custom delegate image that includes the tools you select.
* Use your custom delegate in CI/CD pipelines.

:::info
Delegates with an immutable image type (image tag `yy.mm.xxxxx`) include non-root user privileges and are compatible with OpenShift. For information on delegate types, go to [Delegate image types](/docs/platform/delegates/delegate-concepts/delegate-image-types).

## About the Harness Delegate minimal image

Harness recommends that you use the Harness Delegate minimal image (*`yy.mm.xxxxx.minimal`*) when you set up the Harness Platform for production use. This image has been thoroughly scanned and is free of any high or critical vulnerabilities. Users focused on security tend to prefer this option.

However, the minimal delegate image lacks some binaries that are required for Continuous Delivery (CD) steps to function properly and remain vulnerability-free from third-party tools. Consequently, using the minimal delegate image requires you to configure your delegates and install necessary binaries. For information on delegate types, go to [Delegate image types](/docs/platform/delegates/delegate-concepts/delegate-image-types).

The Harness Delegate minimal image (*`yy.mm.xxxxx.minimal`*) is a lighter, more secure version of the default Harness Delegate image. Its main purpose is to provide an enhanced security profile for users, especially those who prioritize their systems' security. The Harness Delegate minimal images includes the following features.

- **Security Scanned:** The image undergoes rigorous scanning processes to ensure that it is devoid of any high-risk or critical vulnerabilities. This makes it an optimal choice for organizations or users who have stringent security requirements. Harness aims to minimize critical/high vulnerabilities within this image. Achieving complete mitigation isn't always possible due to the continual discovery of vulnerabilities in third-party libraries/tools without immediate remediation. 

- **Limited Binaries:** Unlike the standard delegate, the minimal image does not include all of the default binaries. While this contributes to its lightweight nature and security, it also means that users have additional responsibilities. They must manually configure and add any necessary binaries to make their setup functional.

- **User Responsibilities:** Because the minimal delegate image is devoid of the default binaries, users are in charge of tailoring it to their needs. This includes installing specific binaries essential for their CD steps. This level of control also allows users to maintain an updated environment. By installing the latest versions of necessary binaries, they can ensure that the delegate remains free from potential vulnerabilities found in outdated third-party tools.

- **Preferred by Security-Conscious Users:** Due to its clean security slate, many users who prioritize system security gravitate towards the minimal delegate image. By starting with a minimal setup and adding only what is necessary, they can maintain a tighter control over the software and tools present, thus minimizing potential security risks.

## Use the delegate minimal image to create a custom delegate image

### Select the delegate minimal image

You can build on either of the following Harness-provided images.

| **Image** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Harness Delegate Docker image | A publicly available Docker image providing Harness Delegate. |
| Harness Minimal Delegate Docker image | A minimal delegate image is available in Docker Hub at [https://hub.docker.com/r/harness/delegate/tags](https://hub.docker.com/r/harness/delegate/tags). |

Use the last published `yy.mm.xxxxx` version of the minimal image from the Docker repository.

### Build the delegate image

When you build a custom delegate image, you modify the image you select with user privileges and binaries. This section explains the build script used for the process. In this example, the script builds a custom image for deployment by Kubernetes and by Terraform.

The first lines of the script provide information about the base image and user privileges. This example uses the minimal image with delegate minor version 77029.

```
FROM harness/delegate:24.04.82804.minimal
USER root
```

The delegate container is granted root user privileges.

The first `RUN` block installs or updates the `unzip` and `yum-utils` tools. The `--nodocs` option prevents the installation of documentation on the image.

```
RUN microdnf update \
  && microdnf install --nodocs \
    unzip \
    yum-utils
```

The second `RUN` block uses the `yum` utility to create a configuration file for the HashiCorp repository, and then uses the `microdnf` package manager to install the required Terraform components:

```
RUN yum-config-manager --add-repo https://rpm.releases.hashicorp.com/RHEL/hashicorp.repo \
  && microdnf install -y terraform
```

The final `RUN` block retrieves the Kubernetes `kubectl` command-line tool that is required to manipulate clusters. The Linux `chmod +x` instruction makes the utility executable:

```
RUN mkdir /opt/harness-delegate/tools && cd /opt/harness-delegate/tools \
  && curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl> -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl" && chmod +x kubectl
```

The `ENV` instruction defines the Linux `$PATH` environment variable that provides the location of the tools to be installed:

```
ENV PATH=/opt/harness-delegate/tools/:$PATH
```

The final instruction switches the user back to `harness` to ensure the custom image does not run as root:

```
USER harness
```

The complete script is as follows:

```
FROM harness/delegate:24.04.82804.minimal
USER root

RUN microdnf update \
  && microdnf install --nodocs \
    unzip \
    yum-utils

RUN yum-config-manager --add-repo https://rpm.releases.hashicorp.com/RHEL/hashicorp.repo \
  && microdnf install -y terraform

RUN mkdir /opt/harness-delegate/tools && cd /opt/harness-delegate/tools \
  && curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl" && chmod +x kubectl

ENV PATH=/opt/harness-delegate/tools/:$PATH

USER harness
```

The following example Dockerfile adds all the tools necessary for the Harness platform that are not part of the base image to the minimal delegate. You can remove tools for features you don't use or update versions for your requirements.

### Upload the image to Docker Hub

The next step is to upload your custom image to Docker Hub. For information on working with Docker repositories, go to [Manage repositories](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/repos/) in the Docker documentation.

### Modify the delegate manifest

Before you can deploy a delegate, you must:

* Update the image path to the repository location of the custom image.
* Suspend delegate auto-upgrade functionality.

Delegate auto-upgrade is not compatible with custom images.

#### Upgrade the image path

Open the delegate manifest file and locate the container `spec` (`spec.containers`). Change the image path to reflect the repository location of your uploaded image as shown in the following YAML.

```yaml
 spec:
     terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 600
     restartPolicy: Always
     containers:
     - image: example/org:custom-delegate
       imagePullPolicy: Always
       name: delegate
       securityContext:
         allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
         runAsUser: 0
```

For purposes of this example, the image was uploaded to `example/org:custom-delegate`.

#### Suspend delegate auto-upgrade

Before you deploy a custom delegate, you must suspend its auto-upgrade functionality. This step prevents your image from being automatically upgraded and the installed binaries removed.

To suspend auto-upgrade, in the delegate manifest, locate the `CronJob` resource. In the resource `spec`, set the `suspend` field to `true` as shown in the following YAML:

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1beta1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
 labels:
   harness.io/name: custom-del-upgrader-job
 name: custom-del-upgrader-job
 namespace: harness-delegate-ng
spec:
 suspend: true
 schedule: "0 */1 * * *"
 concurrencyPolicy: Forbid
 startingDeadlineSeconds: 20
```

### Deploy the delegate

You can deploy the delegate from Harness Manager or by applying the modified delegate manifest file to your cluster.

![](./static/build-custom-delegate-images-with-third-party-tools-08.png)

You can confirm the successful deployment and registration of the delegate in Harness Manager. Check the delegate information to ensure that auto-upgrade is not enabled.

## Use your custom delegate image in pipelines

You can use your registered delegate to run Kubernetes and Terraform pipelines. It is a good idea to run a pipeline to validate the delegate image. Harness steps in your pipelines use the installed tooling on the delegate to perform builds or deployments.

For information about creating a Kubernetes pipeline, go to [Kubernetes deployment tutorial](/docs/continuous-delivery/deploy-srv-diff-platforms/kubernetes/kubernetes-cd-quickstart).

For information about creating a Terraform Plan, go to [Provision with the Terraform Apply Step](/docs/continuous-delivery/cd-infrastructure/terraform-infra/run-a-terraform-plan-with-the-terraform-apply-step/).
