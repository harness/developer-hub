## Image type comparison

Harness gives you the option to select delegate images with or without third-party client tools. The use of a delegate packaged with third-party binaries speeds the construction of a CD pipeline; Harness CI and STO do not make use of these libraries. The inclusion of third-party binaries, however, increases attack vectors. Consider security as well as ease of use, in your choice of delegate images. 

Harness rigorously scans delegate images for vulnerabilities. Harness cannot, however, guarantee the elimination of CVEs from delegate images that include third-party client tools. The vulnerabilities that third-party client tools introduce in delegate images cannot be eliminated until the vulnerabilities are repaired in the third-party tools.

The following table differentiates between delegate images based on key features and recommended use. For those images distributed with auto-upgrade enabled, Harness recommends accepting the auto-upgrade setting.

| | Third-party client tools | Minimum CVEs | Auto-upgrade enabled | Disable auto-upgrade | Notes |
| --- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | --- |
| DELEGATE <br /><br />**Base image**: RedHat Universal Base Image (redhat/ubi8)<br />**Recommended use**: Quick deployment of a pipeline | &#x2713; | x | &#x2713;| &#x2713; | Installed as a Kubernetes Deployment resource.<br /><br />Renamed from "immutable delegate." |
| DELEGATE-MINIMAL<br /><br />**Recommended use**: To minimize attack vectors, in the enterprise, or when you want to select and install different tools at build time or runtime | x | &#x2713; | x | &#x2713; | |
| DELEGATE-LEGACY<br /><br />**Deprecated**: Not recommended for use in new Harness accounts | &#x2713; | x | &#x2713; | x | |

## Docker pull commands

The following table provides instructions for retrieval of delegate images.

| Delegate | Docker command |
| --- | --- |
| DELEGATE | `docker pull harness/delegate:` *`<yy.mm.xxxxx>`* |
| DELEGATE-MINIMAL | `docker pull harness/delegate:` *`<yy.mm.xxxxx>.minimal`* |
