This topic lists supported delegate images and their status. Six months after a delegate image is released, the delegate reaches End of Support (EOS). Eight months after a delegate image is released, the delegate is End of Life (EOL). If delegates are past their EOS date, Harness does not support them. For more information, go to [Delegate expiration policy](/docs/platform/delegates/install-delegates/delegate-upgrades-and-expiration#delegate-expiration-policy).

## Delegate support status definitions

### End of support (EOS)

EOS means the following:

- Harness Support will no longer accept support requests for the delegate in both Harness FirstGen and Harness NextGen.

- Security fixes will still be addressed.

- Product defects will not be addressed.

- If delegates are past their EOS date, Harness does not support them. Expired delegates might not work as intended. For issues with expired delegates, Harness Support will request that you upgrade your delegate(s).

### End of life (EOL)

EOL means the following:

- In addition to the EOS clauses, security fixes will not be addressed.

## Supported versions

Supported versions EOS and EOL are based on when the delegate image was pushed to [Harness Delegate Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/harness/delegate/tags).
