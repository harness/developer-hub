The following environment variables are available for use in the Docker delegate manifest. Some of these variables are included in the YAML by default; you can specify others based on use case.

### ACCOUNT_ID

The Harness account ID for the account with which this delegate registers.

```
- ACCOUNT_ID = XXXXXXxxxxxxxxxx
```

### DELEGATE_TOKEN

The Harness account token that is used to register the delegate.

```
- DELEGATE_TOKEN = XXXXXXxxxxxxxxxx
```

### MANAGER_HOST_AND_PORT

The Harness SaaS manager URL. `https` indicates port 443.

```
- MANAGER_HOST_AND_PORT = https://app.harness.io
```

### DELEGATE_NAME

The name of the delegate. This is the name that appears in Harness when the delegate is registered.

You can automate delegate creation by omitting the name and using a script to copy the delegate YAML file, giving a unique name to the `value` of the delegate name for each newly created delegate you want to register.

For more information, go to [Automate delegate installation](/docs/platform/delegates/install-delegates/automate-delegate-installation.md).

```yaml
- name: DELEGATE_NAME
  value: qa
```

### NEXT_GEN

Indicates whether the delegate registers in Harness NextGen (`true`) or FirstGen (`false`).

```yaml
- name: NEXT_GEN
  value: "true"
```

### DELEGATE_DESCRIPTION

The description that is given to the delegate in Harness Manager or YAML before the delegate registers. The description appears on the delegate details page in Harness Manager.

```yaml
- name: DELEGATE_DESCRIPTION
  value: ""
```

### DELEGATE_TYPE

The type of the delegate.

```yaml
- name: DELEGATE_TYPE
  value: "DOCKER"
```

### DELEGATE_TAGS

The tags that were added to the delegate in Harness Manager or YAML before delegate registration.

Harness generates tags based on the delegate name. You can add others. The tags appear on the delegate details page in Harness Manager.

For more information, go to [Tags reference](/docs/platform/references/tags-reference.md) and [Select delegates with tags](/docs/platform/delegates/manage-delegates/select-delegates-with-selectors.md).

```yaml
- name: DELEGATE_TAGS
  value: ""
```

### DELEGATE_TASK_LIMIT

The maximum number of tasks the delegate can perform at one time. Delegate operations are categorized as different types of tasks.

```yaml
- name: DELEGATE_TASK_LIMIT
  value: "50"
```

### PROXY_MANAGER

Indicates whether to use Harness Manager or a proxy. A value of `true` indicates an outbound proxy of traffic to Harness.

The default value is `true`.

```yaml
- PROXY_MANAGER = true
```

### INIT_SCRIPT

You can use this environment variable to run scripts on the delegate. For example, you can add a script to `INIT_SCRIPT` to install software on the delegate pod. The software is installed after you apply the delegate YAML.

A multiline script must follow the YAML spec for [literal scalar style](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2-old/spec.html#id2795688).

For more information, go to [Build custom delegate images with third-party tools](/docs/platform/delegates/install-delegates/build-custom-delegate-images-with-third-party-tools.md).

```yaml
- INIT_SCRIPT =  echo hello world!
```
