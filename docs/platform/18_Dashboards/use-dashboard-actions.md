This topic describes how to use different dashboard actions. The document uses [AWS Cost Dashboard](../../cloud-cost-management/3-use-ccm-cost-reporting/6-use-ccm-dashboards/aws-dashboard.md) as an example. You can use **Dashboard actions** in the same way for other **By Harness Dashboards** too. For example, [GCP Cost Dashboard](../../cloud-cost-management/3-use-ccm-cost-reporting/6-use-ccm-dashboards/gcp-dashboard.md), [Azure Cost Dashboard](../../cloud-cost-management/3-use-ccm-cost-reporting/6-use-ccm-dashboards/azure-cost-dashboard.md), [Cluster Cost Dashboard](../../cloud-cost-management/3-use-ccm-cost-reporting/6-use-ccm-dashboards/cluster-cost-dashboard.md), and so on.

### Step: Use Dashboard Actions

Perform the following steps to use Dashboard actions:

1. In Harness, click **Dashboards**.
2. In **All Dashboards**, select **By Harness** and click **AWS Cost Dashboard**.
3. In AWS Cost Dashboard, click **Dashboard actions** (3-dot menu to the right of the filter button).![](./static/use-dashboard-actions-33.png)

		<p>Updates the time zone of the dashboard. The time zone applied to your dashboard can affect the results shown, because of slight differences in the exact hours used for time-based data. If you are interested in the data as it applies to a different region, change the time zone of your dashboard to reflect that region.</p>
		<p>You can choose one of the following options:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Choose <b>Each tileâ€™s time zone</b> to run all tiles in the time zone in which they were saved.</li>
			<li>Choose <b>Viewer time zone</b> to run all tiles in the time zone selected in your account settings.</li>
			<li>Choose any of the time zones listed in the drop-down to run all tiles in that time zone.</li>
		</ul>
		    After you select your time zone, click <b>Update</b> in the dashboard time zone window; the dashboard will update for the new time zone.Once you navigate away from the dashboard, the dashboard will return to its default time zone setting.
