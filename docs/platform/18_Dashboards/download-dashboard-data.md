This page describes how to download content, visualizations or data, from the **Dashboards**. You can download data using the following options:

* Download Data from a Dashboard
* Download Data from a Dashboard Tile

### Before you begin

* [Create Dashboards](create-dashboards.md)
* [Create Visualizations and Graphs](create-visualizations-and-graphs.md)

### Download Data from a Dashboard

Perform the following steps to download data from a Dashboard.

1. To download the entire dashboard, select **Download** from the dashboard’s three-dot menu.![](./static/download-dashboard-data-20.png)
2. Select PDF or CSV as your download format.

#### Download a Dashboard as a PDF

You can download your entire dashboard as a PDF. The PDF contains the dashboard title, any dashboard filters, all the dashboard tiles, and the time zone the dashboard was run in. The PDF also includes a timestamp showing when the dashboard was downloaded.

1. In **Download AWS Cost Dashboard**, in **Format**, select **PDF**.

2. Select an option from the **Paper Size** drop-down menu. The **Fit Page to Dashboard** option is the default; it sizes the PDF to match the layout of the dashboard on the screen. Other paper size options size the PDF to match a standard paper size and fit the dashboard within it.  
  
   Depending on the layout of the dashboard, large visualizations or groups of overlapping tiles may need to be resized to fit on given page size.

3. If you select something other than **Fit Page to Dashboard** in the **Paper Size** drop-down, an **Orientation** option appears. You can choose to orient the dashboard in portrait or landscape position.
4. Do not select **Expand tables to show all rows**. This option is relevant only for the table visualizations. If selected, the PDF will show all the rows available in the table visualization, not just the rows displayed in the dashboard tile thumbnail.
5. Select or leave unselected **Arrange dashboard tiles in a single column**. If you select this option, the PDF displays dashboard tiles in a single vertical column. If you do not select this option, the dashboard tiles appear as they are arranged in the dashboard.
6. Click **Open in Browser** to see an image of the PDF in a new tab of your browser. This also downloads a PDF in the Download folder.
7. Click **Cancel** if you no longer want to download the dashboard.
8. Click **Download** to initiate the download. A new tab in your browser will open, showing the status of your download.!
