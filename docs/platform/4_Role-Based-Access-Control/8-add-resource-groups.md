A Resource Group is a set of Harness resources that the permission applies to. Permissions given to a user or user group as part of a Role, apply to the set of resources that are part of the Resource Group.

This topic will explain the steps to create and manage Resource Groups within Harness System.

### Before you begin

* [Learn Harness' Key Concepts](../../getting-started/learn-harness-key-concepts.md)
* Make sure you have **Create/Edit/Delete** Permissions for Resource Groups.

### Visual Summary

Here is a quick overview of Resource Groups at various scopes:

* **Account Only** - To include all the resources within the scope of the Account. This does not include resources within the scope of Org or Project.
* **All (including all Organizations and Projects)** - To include all the resources within the scope of the Account, as well as those within the scope of the Orgs and Projects in this Account.
* **Specified Organizations (and their Projects)** - To include all the resources within the scope of specific Organizations and their Projects.

### Review: Resource Groups and Scopes

A Resource Group can contain any of the following:

* All or selected resources from the list of resources in the Resource Group's scope - For example, a Resource Group RG1 created within Account Acc1 can contain all or selected resources created within the same Account Acc1.
* All or selected resources in the scope in which it is defined. For example, all Account level resources, all Account Level Secret Managers, all Connectors in Org A.
* All or specific resources for the entire account - For example, a Resource Group RG1 within Account Acc1 can contain all or selected resources created within Acc1, Organizations within Acc1, Projects within Organizations in Acc1.![](./static/add-resource-groups-33.png)

Harness includes the following built-in Resource Groups at the Account, Org, and Project scope:



|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scope | Resource Group | Description |
| Account | **All Resources Including Child Scopes** | Includes all the resources within the scope of the Account, as well as those within the scope of the Orgs and Projects in this Account. |
| Account | **All Account Level Resources** | Includes all the resources within the scope of the Account. This does not include resources within the scope of Org or Project. |
| Org | **All Resources Including Child Scopes** | Includes all the resources within the scope of the Org, as well as those within the scope of all the Projects created within this Org. |
| Org | **All Organization Level Resources** | Includes all the resources within the scope of the Org. This does not include resources within the scope of Projects. |
| Project | **All Project Level Resources** | Includes all the resources within the scope of the Project. |
