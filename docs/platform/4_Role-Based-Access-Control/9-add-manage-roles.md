Roles are a group of permissions you can assign to a Harness User Group. These permissions determine what operations a User Group can perform on a specific Harness Resource.

This topic will explain the steps to create and manage Roles within Harness.


### Before you begin

* [Learn Harness' Key Concepts](../../getting-started/learn-harness-key-concepts.md)
* Make sure you have Create/Edit/Delete Permissions for Roles.

The **Account Admin** Role has permissions for all the resources within the Account scope as well as its child scope (Organizations and Projects within this Account).

### Step: Add a New Role

This topic assumes you have a Harness Project set up. If not, seeÂ [Create Organizations and Projects](../organizations-and-projects/create-an-organization.md).

You can add a Role in Project/Organization/Account scope. To do this, go to Project SETUP, Organization, or Account Settings. This topic explains how to create a role in the Account scope.

Select your **Project/Org/Account**, and click **Access Control**.

Click **Roles**.

Click **New Role**. The **New Role** settings appear.

Enter a **Name** for your **Role**.

Enter optional **Description** and **Tags** for your **Role**.

Click **Save**.

### Step: Delete Role

Click the **Roles** tab under **Access** **Control**.

Click **Delete** in the top right corner to delete a specific role.

### Step: Manage Role

Click the **Roles** tab under **Access Control**.

Click on the role you want to edit. The **Update Role Permissions** page appears.
