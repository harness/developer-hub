Connect Harness to monitoring and logging systems by adding a verification provider Connector.

You can add a verification provider Connector inline when developing your pipeline, or separately in your Account/Org/Project's resources. Once you add the Connector, it is available in Pipelines of the same Account/Org/Project.


### Monitoring and Logging Systems Scope

You can add a verification provider Connector at the Account/Org/Project scope.

This topic explains how to add a verification provider Connector at the Project scope. The process is same for Org and Account.

5. Click **Continue**.
6. In the **URL** field, enter the URL for accessing the REST API on the Splunk server. Include the port number in the format **https://<deployment-name>.cloud.splunk.com:8089.</deployment-name> ** The default port number is 8089, which is required for hosted Splunk, also. For example: **https://mycompany.splunkcloud.com:8089**.
   
   ![](../static/connect-to-monitoring-and-logging-systems-20.png)
   

Splunk APIs require that you authenticate with a non-SAML account. To access your Splunk Cloud deployment using the Splunk REST API and SDKs, submit a support case requesting access on the Support Portal. For managed deployments, Splunk Support opens port 8089 for REST access. You can specify a range of IP addresses to control who can access the REST API. For self-service deployments, Splunk Support defines a dedicated user and sends you credentials that enable that user to access the REST API. For information see [Using the REST API with Splunk Cloud](http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/7.2.0/RESTTUT/RESTandCloud).

Ensure that the Splunk user account used to authenticate Harness with Splunk is assigned to a role that contains the following REST-related capabilities:

* Search.
* Access to the indexes you want to search.

In the following example we've created a new Splunk role named **Harness User**, and assigned it search capability:

![](../static/connect-to-monitoring-and-logging-systems-22.png)

We've given this role access to **All non-internal indexes**. However, we could restrict the access to only the few relevant indexes:

![](../static/connect-to-monitoring-and-logging-systems-23.png)

1. In the **Username** field, enter the username of your Splunk account.
2. In **Password** field, you can choose **Create or Select a secret.**


:::info note
For secrets and other sensitive settings, select or create a new [Text Secret.](/docs/platform/secrets/add-use-text-secrets)

:::

1. Click **Connect and Save**. The Setup Delegates settings appear.
2.  You can choose **Connect via any available delegate** or **Connect only via delegates which has all of the following tags.** If you select a Delegate, Harness will always use that Delegate for this Connector.
3.  Click **Save and Continue**.
4.  Once the Test Connection succeeds, click **Finish**. Splunk is listed under the list of Connectors.
