Harness cloud provider connectors integrate your cloud platforms with Harness. You set up connectors with the connection information and credentials you need to perform tasks in Harness, such as deploying services.

You can add a cloud provider connector at the account, org, or project scope.

If you plan to use a cloud provider connector with [Harness Cloud build infrastructure](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/set-up-build-infrastructure/use-harness-cloud-build-infrastructure), the **Connectivity Mode** must be **Connect through Harness Platform**.

For instructions and information about the Harness cloud provider connectors, go to:

- [Platform agnostic Kubernetes cluster connector](add-a-kubernetes-cluster-connector.md)
