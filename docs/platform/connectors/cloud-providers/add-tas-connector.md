This topic describes how to set up the Harness Delegate in your TAS environment and add the cloud provider used to connect to your Tanzu cloud for deployment.

## Install the Harness Delegate

Harness Delegate is a service you run in your local network or VPC to connect your artifacts, TAS infrastructure, and any other providers with the Harness Manager.

Expand the following section to learn how to install the Harness Delegate.

<details>
<summary>Use the delegate installation wizard</summary>

1. In your Harness project, select **Project Setup**.
2. Select **Delegates**.
3. Select **Install a Delegate**.
4. Follow the instructions in the delegate installation wizard.

Use this [delegate installation wizard video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLMCxs3onH8) to guide you through the process.

</details>

import DelegateInstall from '/tutorials/platform/install-delegate.md';

<details>
<summary>Use the terminal</summary>
<DelegateInstall />
</details>

## Install the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI) on your Harness Delegate

After the delegate pods are created, you must edit your Harness Delegate YAML to install CF CLI v7, `autoscaler`, and `Create-Service-Push` plugins.

1. Open `delegate.yaml` in a text editor.
2. Locate the environment variable `INIT_SCRIPT` in the `Deployment` object.
   ```
   - name: INIT_SCRIPT
   value: ""
   ```
3. Replace `value: ""` with the following script to install CF CLI, `autoscaler`, and `Create-Service-Push` plugins.

   :::info

   Harness Delegate uses Red Hatâ€“based distributions such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) or Red Hat Universal Base Image (UBI). Hence, we recommend that you use `microdnf` commands to install CF CLI on your delegate. If you are using a package manager in Debian-based distributions such as Ubuntu, use `apt-get` commands to install CF CLI on your delegate.

   Make sure to use your API token for pivnet login in the following script.

4. Apply the profile to the delegate profile and check the logs.

   The output for `cf --version` is `cf version 7.2.0+be4a5ce2b.2020-12-10`.

   Here is the output for `cf plugins`.

   ```
   App Autoscaler        2.0.295   autoscaling-apps              Displays apps bound to the autoscaler

   Create-Service-Push   1.3.2     create-service-push, cspush   Works in the same manner as cf push, except that it will create services defined in a services-manifest.yml file first before performing a cf push.
   ```

   :::note
   The CF Command script does not require `cf login`. Harness logs in by using the credentials in the TAS cloud provider set up in the infrastructure definition for the workflow executing the CF Command.

## Add the Harness TAS provider

You can connect Harness to a TAS space by adding a TAS connector.

Perform the following steps to add a TAS connector.

1. Open a Harness project, and then select **Connectors** under **Project Setup**.
2. Select **New Connector**, and select **Tanzu Application Service** under **Cloud Providers**.
3. Enter a connector name, enter an optional description and tag, and then select **Continue**.

   Harness automatically creates an **[ID](/docs/platform/References/entity-identifier-reference)** for the connector. The ID is based on the connector's name.

4. Enter the TAS **Endpoint URL**. For example, `https://api.system.tas-mycompany.com`.
5. In **Authentication**, select one of the following options:
   - **Plaintext** - Enter the username and password. For password, you can either create a new secret or use an existing one.
   - **Encrypted** - Enter the username and password. You can create a new secret for your username and password or use exiting ones.
6. Select **Continue**.
7. In **Connect to the provider**, select **Connect through a Harness Delegate**, and then select **Continue**.

   We don't recommend using the **Connect through Harness Platform** option here because you'll need a delegate later for connecting to your TAS environment. Typically, the **Connect through Harness Platform** option is a quick way to make connections without having to use delegates.

8. In **Set Up Delegates**, select the **Connect using Delegates with the following Tags** option, and then enter the name of the [delegate](#install-the-harness-delegate) you created earlier.
9. Select **Save and Continue**.
10. Once the test connection succeeds, select **Finish**.

    The connector now appears in the **Connectors** list.

### Refresh Token Support

:::note

Currently, Refresh token authentication support is behind the feature flag `CDS_CF_TOKEN_AUTH`. Contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io) to enable the feature. Harness Delegate version 23.12.81804 or later is required to use this feature.

:::

Harness provides the option to use a Refresh token to authenticate with the Tanzu connector. This Refresh token is used by Harness to verify your Tanzu instance. However, you still need to provide a username and password to authenticate with Tanzu. These credentials are used to obtain a new Refresh token. Once the Refresh token is provided in the connector, Harness uses it to authenticate and perform each task. Harness will authenticate with the Refresh token before executing each Tanzu step defined in the pipeline.

You can retrieve the Refresh token via the `config.json` file you receive when authenticating with the CF client. You can pass the Refresh token as a secret stored in the Harness Secrets Manager or your secrets manager of choice.
