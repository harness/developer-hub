This topic provides settings and permissions for the Docker connector.

:::info Important notes

* **Docker registry rate limits:** Harness is restricted by the limits of the Docker repo, such as [Docker Hub limits](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/download-rate-limit/) for pulling Docker images from Docker repos.
* **Docker Registries in Cloud Platforms:** The Docker connector is platform-agnostic and can be used to connect to any Docker container registry. Harness also provides first class support for registries in AWS and GCR through [AWS connectors](../../../connectors/cloud-providers/add-aws-connector.md) and [Google Cloud Platform (GCP) connectors](../../../connectors/cloud-providers/connect-to-google-cloud-platform-gcp.md).

:::

## Create a Docker connector

1. In Harness, go to the module and project where you want to create the connector, and select **Connectors** (under **Project Setup**). You can also create connectors at the account level.
2. Select **New Connector**, and then select **Docker Registry**.
3. Configure the Docker connector settings as described in the sections below.
4. Select **Save and Continue**, wait for the connectivity test to run, and then select **Finish**.
5. In the list of connectors, make a note of your Docker connector's ID. Use the ID in your pipeline YAML, such as `connectorRef: docker_connector_ID`.

## Connector metadata settings

* **Name:** Enter a name for this connector. Harness creates and **Id** ([Entity Identifier](../../../references/entity-identifier-reference.md)) based on the name.
* **Description:** Optional text string.
* **Tags:** Optional. Go to the [Tags reference](../../../references/tags-reference.md).

## Docker Registry URL

The URL of the Docker registry. This is usually the URL used for your [docker login](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/) credentials.

To connect to a public Docker registry like Docker Hub, use `https://index.docker.io/v2/`.

To connect to a private Docker registry, use `https://registry.hub.docker.com/v2/`.

## Provider type

Select the Docker registry platform, such as Docker Hub, Harbor, Quay, and so on.

## Authentication

You can authenticate anonymously or by username and password.

```mdx-code-block
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
```
```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="unpw" label="Username and password" default>
```

* **Username:** Enter the username for your Docker registry account.
* **Password:** In your Docker registry, create a personal access token with **Read, Write, Delete** permissions. Then, create a [Harness secret](/docs/platform/secrets/add-use-text-secrets) for your Docker registry personal access token.

:::info Docker registry permissions

Make sure the connected user account has *read permission for all repositories* as well as access and permissions to *pull images* and *list images and tags*.

For more information, go to the Docker documentation on [Docker Permissions](https://docs.docker.com/datacenter/dtr/2.0/user-management/permission-levels/).

:::

```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="anonymous" label="Anonymous">
```

If you use anonymous access for a Kubernetes deployment, make sure `imagePullSecrets` is removed from the container specification. This is standard Kubernetes behavior and not related to Harness specifically.

```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

## Select connectivity mode

You can connect through a delegate or the Harness Platform. If you plan to use this connector with Harness Cloud build infrastructure, you must select **Connect through Harness Platform**.
