Harness Cloud Cost Management (CCM) monitors and provides visibility into the cloud costs of your Amazon Web Services (AWS) across your cloud infrastructure and AWS services, such as EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda, and so on. CCM also allows you to optimize your instances, auto-scaling groups (ASGs), and EKS clusters using intelligent cloud AutoStopping rules.

You can set up CCM for your AWS resources in a simple two-step process:

1. Create a Cost and Usage Report (CUR) — Harness CCM uses a secure, cross-account role with a restricted policy to access the cost and usage reports and resources for cost analysis.
2. Create a Cloudformation stack to provision IAM Roles and corresponding policies to grant access for the required features.

> **☆ NOTE —** After enabling CCM, it takes about 24 hours for the data to be available for viewing and analysis.### AWS Connector requirements

* The same connector cannot be used in NextGen and FirstGen. 
* For CCM, AWS connectors are available only at the Account level in Harness.
* You can create multiple connectors per AWS account. 
* Review the AWS connector requirements for different CCM features:
	+ **Cost Visibility**: You can create an AWS connector for the master or linked account. CCM requires one connector per AWS account (master or linked) for cost visibility.
	+ **AWS ECS and Resource Inventory Management**: You need to create an AWS connector for each linked account. For inventory management, CCM requires a connector for all the linked accounts.
	+ **AWS Resource Optimization Using AutoStopping Rules**: You need to create an AWS connector for each linked account. For resource optimization using AutoStopping Rules, CCM requires a connector for all the linked accounts.

## Cost and Usage Reports (CUR) and CCM requirements

* If you have a [consolidated billing process](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/useconsolidatedbilling-procedure.html) enabled, then CCM needs read-only access to the cost and usage reports (CUR) stored in the S3 bucket in the master or payer account. This gives access to the cost data for all the accounts (linked/member) in the organization.
* If you don't have consolidated billing enabled at the organization level then you can create the CUR at a linked account level.
* If you have provided CUR access to the master account then you do not need to provide billing details for each linked account. CCM requires one connector per AWS account (master or linked).  
  It is recommended to create a CUR at the master account to avoid the CUR creation step for each linked account.
* If you do not have access to the master account, you can create an AWS connector in the linked account for which you have the required access.
* If you have created a billing report for your [AWS account ID](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/console_account-alias.html#FindingYourAWSId) once, then you can use the same CUR again for the AWS connector. You do not need to create CUR again for the same account.

## AWS access permissions

CCM requires the following permissions:

> **☆ NOTE —** If you don't have access to create a cost and usage report or run a CloudFormation template, contact your IT or security teams to provide the required permissions.

### Cost Visibility

The cost visibility policy performs the following actions:

* List CUR reports and visibility into the organization's Structure
* Get objects from the S3 bucket configured in the CUR
* Put objects into the Harness S3 bucket
```
  HarnessBillingMonitoringPolicy:  
    Type: 'AWS::IAM::ManagedPolicy'  
    Condition: CreatingHarnessBillingMonitoringPolicy  
    Properties:  
      Description: Policy granting Harness Access to Collect Billing Data    
      PolicyDocument:  
        Version: 2012-10-17  
        Statement:  
          - Effect: Allow  
            Action:  
              - 's3:GetBucketLocation'  
              - 's3:ListBucket'  
              - 's3:GetObject'  
            Resource:  
              - !Join  
                - ''  
                - - 'arn:aws:s3:::'  
                  - !Ref BucketName  
              - !Join

                    - - 'arn:aws:s3:::'  
                      - !Ref BucketName  
                  - '*'  
          - Effect: Allow  
            Action:  
              - 's3:ListBucket'  
              - 's3:PutObject'  
              - 's3:PutObjectAcl'  
            Resource:  
              - 'arn:aws:s3:::ce-customer-billing-data-prod*'  
              - 'arn:aws:s3:::ce-customer-billing-data-prod*/*'  
          - Effect: Allow  
            Action:   
              - 'cur:DescribeReportDefinitions'  
              - 'organizations:Describe*'  
              - 'organizations:List*'  
            Resource: "*"  
      Roles:  
        - !Ref HarnessCloudFormationRole
```

If the `cur:DescribeReportDefinitions`, `organizations:Describe`, and `organizations:List*` permissions are too wide, you can modify these to the following:


```
{  
    "Version": "2012-10-17",  
    "Statement": [  
        {  
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",  
            "Effect": "Allow",  
            "Action": [  
                "organizations:ListAccounts",  
                "organizations:ListTagsForResource"  
            ],  
            "Resource": "*"  
        }  
    ]  
}
```
* `organizations:ListAccounts`: fetches a list of all the accounts present in the organization, and also fetches the accountID to Account Name mapping.
* `organizations:ListTagsForResource`: fetches the AWS Account level tags. Harness supports account tags within CCM that can be used for reporting and analysis.

### AWS ECS and Resource Inventory Management

The inventory management policy performs the following actions:

* ECS Visibility - For Granular Cluster Cost Breakdown
* EC2, EBS, RDS Visibility - Inventory Management  

```
HarnessEventsMonitoringPolicy:  
  Type: 'AWS::IAM::ManagedPolicy'  
  Condition: CreateHarnessEventsMonitoringPolicy  
  Properties:  
    Description: Policy granting Harness Access to Enable Event Collection  
    PolicyDocument:

              - 'rds:DescribeDBSnapshotAttributes'  
          Resource: '*'  
    Roles:  
      - !Ref HarnessCloudFormationRole
```

### Insight into RDS instances

This feature provides visibility into your EC2, EBS volumes, and ECS costs. The insights provided by inventory management can be consumed by finance teams to understand resource utilization across the board.

* Breakdown by ECS cluster cost, Service, Task, and Launch Type (EC2, Fargate).
* Insight into EC2 instances and their utilization.
* Access to AWS EC2 Inventory Cost and EBS Volumes and Snapshots inventory dashboards. For more information, see [View AWS EC2 Inventory Cost Dashboard](/docs/cloud-cost-management/2-use-cloud-cost-management/8-ccm-dashboards-and-access-control/ccm-dashboards-by-harness/view-aws-ec-2-inventory-cost-dashboard.md), [Orphaned EBS Volumes and Snapshots Dashboard](/docs/cloud-cost-management/2-use-cloud-cost-management/8-ccm-dashboards-and-access-control/ccm-dashboards-by-harness/orphaned-ebs-volumes-and-snapshots-dashboard.md), and [View AWS EC2 Instance Metrics Dashboard](/docs/cloud-cost-management/2-use-cloud-cost-management/8-ccm-dashboards-and-access-control/ccm-dashboards-by-harness/view-aws-ec-2-instance-metrics.md).
