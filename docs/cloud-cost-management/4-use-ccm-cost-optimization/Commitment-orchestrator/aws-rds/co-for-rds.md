# Commitment Orchestrator for RDS

Commitment Orchestrator for RDS helps you optimize your Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) costs by automatically managing your Reserved Instance (RI) commitments. It analyzes your RDS usage patterns and recommends the most cost-effective combination of Reserved Instances.

## Key Features

- **Automated RI Management**: Automatically purchases and exchanges RDS Reserved Instances based on your usage patterns
- **Multi-Account Support**: Manages RDS commitments across all your AWS accounts from a single master account
- **Smart Coverage Optimization**: Intelligently determines the optimal coverage percentage for your RDS instances
- **Flexible Instance Family Support**: Supports various RDS instance families and database engines

## Prerequisites

Before setting up Commitment Orchestrator for RDS, ensure you have:

1. A Harness account with CCM module enabled
2. AWS master account with appropriate permissions
3. Necessary IAM roles and policies configured

## Setting up Commitment Orchestrator for RDS

### Step 1: Configure Master Account

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="existing" label="Using Existing Connector">
Select an existing connector that is already configured for your master account. Ensure it has the necessary permissions for RDS Commitment Orchestrator.

**Required Permissions**:
- `rds:DescribeReservedDBInstances`
- `rds:DescribeDBInstances`
- `rds:PurchaseReservedDBInstancesOffering`
- `ce:GetReservationUtilization`
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="new" label="Creating New Connector">
Create a new connector specifically for your master account with the required RDS permissions.

:::note
The connector must be created at the Master Account level. Commitment Orchestrator will not be visible in child account connectors.
:::
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Step 2: Configure Instance Exclusions

You can exclude specific RDS instances or entire child accounts from Commitment Orchestrator management:

1. Navigate to the Exclusions section
2. Select the accounts or instances you want to exclude
3. Save your exclusion preferences

:::important
Excluded instances will not be considered for RI purchase calculations, but existing RIs may still be applied to these instances based on AWS's standard matching rules.
:::

### Step 3: Set Coverage Parameters

Define your RDS commitment strategy by configuring:

1. **Coverage Percentage**: Set the percentage of your RDS compute spend to be covered by Reserved Instances
2. **Commitment Term**: Choose between 1-year or 3-year commitments
3. **Payment Options**: Select from All Upfront, Partial Upfront, or No Upfront payment options

### Step 4: Review and Activate

1. Review your configuration settings
2. Verify the estimated cost savings
3. Activate Commitment Orchestrator for RDS

## Monitoring and Management

### Dashboard Overview

The RDS Commitment Orchestrator dashboard provides:

- Current RI coverage and utilization metrics
- Cost savings analysis
- Active commitments summary
- Upcoming RI expiration alerts
- Purchase recommendations

### Optimization Reports

Access detailed reports showing:

- RI utilization patterns
- Cost comparison (On-Demand vs RI)
- Savings achieved
- Optimization opportunities

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Review**: Monitor your RDS usage patterns and adjust coverage settings as needed
2. **Instance Family Selection**: Consider future database requirements when selecting instance families
3. **Commitment Terms**: Balance between longer terms for higher discounts and flexibility needs
4. **Multi-Region Strategy**: Consider region-specific usage patterns when setting up coverage

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Insufficient Permissions**
   - Verify IAM roles and policies
   - Ensure master account has necessary permissions

2. **Coverage Gaps**
   - Check exclusion settings
   - Verify instance family compatibility

3. **Utilization Issues**
   - Review instance matching criteria
   - Check for any mismatched instance types



## Native User Approval
With this feature, users can approve the recommendations generated by the orchestrator. This feature enhances the functionality of the orchestrator by enabling user actions such as approval or rejection of recommendations generated by the engine. 

### Supported actions:

The Commitment Orchestrator supports six action states currently:

* **APPROVED**: You can approve the recommendation, allowing the action to proceed.
* **REJECTED**: You can choose to reject the recommendation, preventing the action from taking place.
* **APPROVAL_PENDING**: The action is pending approval by the user. This is the default state for all recommendations and any pending actions will expire in 24 hours.
* **EXPIRED**: The recommended action has expired.
* **ERROR**: The approval process encounters an error.
* **COMPLETED**: The approved recommendation has been successfully completed.

### Action Center UI

In the Action Center UI, you can:

- View a list of all recommendations generated by the engine, categorized by day and recommendation type.
- Approve or reject recommendations individually, in subsets, or all at once.
- Perform actions on different master accounts and regions.

:::info
You can change and select the mode (either automatic approval or manual approval) during the setup flow.
