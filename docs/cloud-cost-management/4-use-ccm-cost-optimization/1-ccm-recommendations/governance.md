## Before you begin

- Connect your cloud account in Harness and set up CCM for cost management. For more information: - For AWS, go to: [Set up cost visibility for AWS](../../get-started/onboarding-guide/set-up-cost-visibility-for-aws.md) - For GCP, go to: [Set up cost visibility for GCP](../../get-started/onboarding-guide/set-up-cost-visibility-for-gcp.md) - For Azure, go to: [Set up cost visibility for Azure](../../get-started/onboarding-guide/set-up-cost-visibility-for-azure.md)

- To obtain governance recommendations, configure a Harness CCM connector with the **Cloud Governance** feature enabled.
- Make sure that you have added the required permissions in your Cloud account.

## View your cost governance recommendations

1. In **Harness**, go to the **Cloud Costs** module.
2. Click **Recommendations**.
3. There are two tabs present on the window - "Open Recommendations" and "Applied Recommendations". Open Recommendation tab shows all the recommendations that are currently available for applying and the potential monthly savings that the user can achieve if they are applied. On the other hand, Applied Recommendations show all the recommendations that have already been applied and the total savings achieved with their application.
4. The recommendations window allows you to put filters on the recommendations to see the result as per convenience. Kindly choose "Governance" in "Recommendation Type" filter for all governance recommendations. Currently, these are filters supported:
