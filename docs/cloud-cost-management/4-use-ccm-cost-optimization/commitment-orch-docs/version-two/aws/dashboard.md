Post setting up Commitment Orchestrator, navigate to Commitments > Click on "View Details" in Orchestrator you want to view details for. The dashboard will show:

-----

- **Savings Breakdown**: This provides information about total savings through Savings Plans and Reserved Instances, as well as savings orchestrated by Harness. You can also see a graph for saving trends and details where you will see all commitment types and aggregate savings with variance compared to the last period.

------

- **Spend Breakdown**: This represents the percentage of your EC2 compute usage covered by Reserved Instances or Savings Plans. It shows coverage by cost/hrs and displays how much you've spent on-demand as the total average coverage. It also shows average coverage by purchase options (On-Demand, Savings Plans, Reserved Instances, and Spot Instances) along with a graph for trend and breakdown. You can view compute coverage either by cost or by hours. When viewing by hours, it shows you the commitment hours and the coverage by purchase option in hours. 

    **Important**: Both net amortized and unblended costs are now displayed, allowing you to view your spend in the format that best suits your needs.

- **Actions**: The Actions tab enables users to review and manage recommendations generated by the Commitment Orchestrator. You can view all the details regarding the pending approvals and executed actions categorized by day and type, then approve or reject them individually, in subsets, or all at once across different master accounts and regions. The Commitment Orchestrator supports six action states currently:

        - **Completed**: The approved recommendation has been successfully purchased in AWS.

        - **Error**: The commitment purchase encounters an API error in AWS.

        - **Approved**: You have approve the recommendation, allowing the action to proceed.

        - **Rejected**: The recommendation has been rejected, preventing the action from taking place.

        - **Expired**: The recommended action has expired.

        - **Queued**: The action is in the queue and waiting to be processed.

- **Inventory**: With the new look of Commitment Orchestrator, Harness has introduced the inventory feature where you can see all purchases along with their status (expired, expiring soon, or active). This unified inventory eliminates the need for separate AWS views or manual exports, giving you complete visibility directly inside Harness. You can select between Reserved Instances and Savings Plans to view their status and type.
    
    **Inventory for RI**: Includes information about Reserved Instances purchased and details about instances managed by Harness, categorized by status (expired, expiring soon, or active). You can filter by status and instance type, with additional filters including:

    - **Instance family**: Filter by EC2 instance family (e.g., t2, m5, c5).
    - **Platform**: Filter by operating system platform (Linux, Windows).
    - **Tenancy**: Filter by instance tenancy type (Default, shared).
    - **Payment Option**: Filter by payment structure (All Upfront, No Upfront).
    - **Term**: Filter by commitment duration (1-year or 3-year terms).
    - **RI Type**: Filter by Reserved Instance type (Standard or Convertible).

    **Inventory for SP**: Includes details about Savings Plans purchased and plans managed by Harness along with their status. You can filter according to status and apply additional filters for deeper analysis. The supporting filters are:

    - **Payment Option**: Filter by payment structure (All Upfront, No Upfront).
    - **Term**: Filter by commitment duration (1-year or 3-year terms).
    - **SP Type**: Filter by Savings Plan type.

    The inventory table shows you all the details about the ID of the Savings Plan or RI, type, region, commitment amount, start date, and expiry date.
