Post set-up, you can view your dashboard with all the information required. You can manipulate the information shown according to filters such as **Instances** and **Regions** and see all the information related to **Computer Coverage**, **Savings**, **Commitment Utilization** along with **Log History**. This way, the dashboard allows you to easily keep track of your commitments and make informed decisions.

- **Savings Breakdown**: This provides information about total savings through Savings Plans and Reserved Instances, as well as savings orchestrated by Harness. You can also see a graph for saving trends and details where you will see all commitment types and aggregate savings with variance compared to the last period.

- **Spend Breakdown**: This shows total compute spend and average daily spend along with spend by purchase options which can be On-Demand, Savings Plans, Reserved Instances, Spot Instances, and your new commitments. We also provide a graph showing your spend across different instance types along with the variance. 

**Important**: Both net amortized and unblended costs are now displayed, allowing you to view your spend in the format that best suits your needs.

- **Compute Coverage**: This represents the percentage of your EC2 compute usage covered by Reserved Instances or Savings Plans. It shows coverage by cost and displays how much you've spent on-demand as the total average coverage. It also shows average coverage by purchase options (On-Demand, Savings Plans, Reserved Instances, and Spot Instances) along with a graph for trend and breakdown. You can view compute coverage either by cost or by hours. When viewing by hours, it shows you the commitment hours and the coverage by purchase option in hours.

- **Commitment Utilization**: This represents the percentage of your purchased Reserved Instances and Savings Plans that are actively being used. It shows the commitment utilization by purchase options. You can view utilization for all your commitments, including Savings Plans and Reserved Instances, as well as the utilization orchestrated by Harness. A graph displays the trend and details for compute utilization and variance over time.

- **Actions**: The Active Actions feature enables users to review and manage recommendations generated by the Commitment Orchestrator. You can view all recommendations categorized by day and type, then approve or reject them individually, in subsets, or all at once across different master accounts and regions.

    **Supported Actions**:
    The Commitment Orchestrator supports six action states currently:

    - **APPROVED**: You can approve the recommendation, allowing the action to proceed.
    - **REJECTED**: You can choose to reject the recommendation, preventing the action from taking place.
    - **APPROVAL_PENDING**: The action is pending approval by the user. This is the default state for all recommendations and any pending actions will expire in 24 hours.
    - **EXPIRED**: The recommended action has expired.
    - **ERROR**: The approval process encounters an error.
    - **COMPLETED**: The approved recommendation has been successfully completed.

- **Inventory**: With the new look of Commitment Orchestrator, Harness has introduced the inventory feature where you can see all purchases and managed instances along with their status (expired, expiring soon, or active). This unified inventory eliminates the need for separate AWS views or manual exports, giving you complete visibility directly inside Harness. You can select between Reserved Instances and Savings Plans to view their status and type.

    **Inventory for RI**: Includes information about Reserved Instances purchased and details about instances managed by Harness, categorized by status (expired, expiring soon, or active). You can filter by status and instance type, with additional filters including:

    - **Instance family**: Filter by EC2 instance family (e.g., t2, m5, c5).
    - **Platform**: Filter by operating system platform (Linux, Windows).
    - **Tenancy**: Filter by instance tenancy type (Default, shared).
    - **Payment Option**: Filter by payment structure (All Upfront, No Upfront).
    - **Term**: Filter by commitment duration (1-year or 3-year terms).
    - **RI Type**: Filter by Reserved Instance type (Standard or Convertible).

    **Inventory for SP**: Includes details about Savings Plans purchased and plans managed by Harness along with their status. You can filter according to status and apply additional filters for deeper analysis. The supporting filters are:

    - **Payment Option**: Filter by payment structure (All Upfront, No Upfront).
    - **Term**: Filter by commitment duration (1-year or 3-year terms).
    - **SP Type**: Filter by Savings Plan type.

    The inventory table shows you all the details about the ID of the Savings Plan or RI, type, region, commitment amount, start date, and expiry date.
