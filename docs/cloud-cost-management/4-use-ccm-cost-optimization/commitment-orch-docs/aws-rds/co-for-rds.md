# Commitment Orchestrator for RDS

Commitment Orchestrator for RDS helps you optimize your Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) costs by automatically managing your Reserved Instance (RI) commitments. It analyzes your RDS usage patterns and recommends the most cost-effective combination of Reserved Instances.

## Key Features

- **Automated RI Management**: Automatically purchases and exchanges RDS Reserved Instances based on your usage patterns
- **Multi-Account Support**: Manages RDS commitments across all your AWS accounts from a single master account
- **Smart Coverage Optimization**: Intelligently determines the optimal coverage percentage for your RDS instances
- **Flexible Instance Family Support**: Supports various RDS instance families and database engines

1. A Harness account with CCM module enabled

## Native User Approval
With this feature, users can approve the recommendations generated by the orchestrator. This feature enhances the functionality of the orchestrator by enabling user actions such as approval or rejection of recommendations generated by the engine. 

### Supported actions:

The Commitment Orchestrator supports six action states currently:

* **APPROVED**: You can approve the recommendation, allowing the action to proceed.
* **REJECTED**: You can choose to reject the recommendation, preventing the action from taking place.
* **APPROVAL_PENDING**: The action is pending approval by the user. This is the default state for all recommendations and any pending actions will expire in 24 hours.
* **EXPIRED**: The recommended action has expired.
* **ERROR**: The approval process encounters an error.
* **COMPLETED**: The approved recommendation has been successfully completed.
