# Setting Up AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB)

## Overview

An AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) serves as the entry point for HTTP/HTTPS traffic to your AutoStopping-managed resources. It intelligently routes requests and works with AutoStopping to start and stop resources based on traffic patterns.

## How AWS Load Balancer Works with AutoStopping

![AWS Load Balancer Architecture](./static/create-load-balancer-aws-14.png)

A Harness load balancer in AWS consists of two primary components:

1. **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**: Routes HTTP/HTTPS traffic based on application-level information
2. **Lambda Function**: Manages resource warm-up and displays progress pages during startup

### Key Benefits

- **Centralized Traffic Management**: Direct traffic to multiple AutoStopped resources
- **Reuse Across Rules**: One load balancer can serve multiple AutoStopping rules
- **Path-Based Routing**: Route different paths to different resource groups
- **Seamless User Experience**: Users access resources through familiar URLs

### DNS Configuration

Each load balancer requires a domain name (e.g., `*.autostopping.example.com`) that points to the load balancer. This is typically configured as:

```
*.autostopping.example.com → Load balancer DNS address
```

## Setup Process

### Prerequisites

- An active AWS account with appropriate permissions
- A domain name you can configure (either in Route 53 or another DNS provider)
- [AWS Connector configured in Harness](/docs/cloud-cost-management/get-started/onboarding-guide/set-up-cost-visibility-for-aws)

### Creating a Load Balancer from the AutoStopping Homepage

<DocImage path={require('./static/as-lb-aws.png')} width="100%" height="100%" title="Click to view full size image" />

1. In the AutoStopping overview page, click **Load Balancers** in the top right
2. Enter a name and select **AWS** in **Cloud Provider**
3. Choose a cloud connector or create a [new one](/docs/cloud-cost-management/get-started/onboarding-guide/set-up-cost-visibility-for-aws). 
4. Enter **Load Balancer Configuration**.
   - Choose access type as **Internal** or **External**
   - Select the AWS region for deployment
   - Choose an SSL certificate
   - Select the VPC for deployment
   - Choose appropriate security groups

7. Click **Save Load Balancer**


Your load balancer is now ready to use with AutoStopping rules.

:::note DNS Configuration
If using **Route 53**, Harness automatically creates the necessary DNS record:
```
A record: *.autostopping.yourdomain.com → [ALB DNS address]
```

If using **another DNS provider**, you'll need to manually create a CNAME record:
1. Go to your DNS provider's management console
2. Create a wildcard CNAME record: `*.autostopping.yourcompany.com → [ALB DNS address]`
3. For detailed instructions, see [AWS DNS CNAME documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/managedservices/latest/ctexguide/ex-dirserv-cname-record-add-col.html)

## Updating the Lambda Function

The AWS Load Balancer uses a Lambda function to manage traffic and handle resource warm-up. You may need to update this function to the latest version.

```

### Step 1: Locate the Lambda Function

1. Go to the AWS Console and navigate to the EC2 service
2. Select **Load Balancers** and find your AutoStopping ALB
3. Go to the **Listeners** tab
4. Find the default rule and note the target group
5. The target group contains the Lambda function that needs updating

### Step 2: Update the Function Code
