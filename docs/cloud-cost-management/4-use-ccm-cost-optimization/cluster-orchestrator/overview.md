Harness’ Cloud Cost Management is centered on three key pillars: Cost Visibility, Cost Optimization and Cost Governance.
Currently AutoStopping, Recommendations and Commitment Orchestrator (in beta) are present under cost optimisation. Harness CCM has added Cluster Orchestrator for EKS (Beta) to enhance workload-driven autoscaling and intelligent management of AWS Spot instances, contributing to overall cost efficiency. 

## AWS Spot Instances and challenges 

Amazon EC2 provides a range of purchase options catering to diverse computing needs, including On-Demand Instances, Reserved Instances, and Spot Instances. While On-Demand Instances offer flexibility with pay-as-you-go pricing, Reserved Instances provide significant cost savings with long-term commitments. Spot Instances, on the other hand, allow users to bid for unused EC2 capacity at lower prices, making them ideal for fault-tolerant, flexible and stateless workloads. However, Spot Instances come with challenges such as potential interruptions and the risk of termination within just 2 minutes of a notice if capacity becomes unavailable.

#### 1. Dynamic Workload Balancing ✓ SOLVED

Traditional clusters struggle with fluctuating workload demands, leading to either over-provisioning (wasted resources) or under-provisioning (performance issues).

**Cluster Orchestrator Solution**: AI-driven predictive scaling that anticipates workload changes before they occur, maintaining optimal performance while minimizing costs through real-time resource allocation adjustments.

#### 2. Cost Visibility & Allocation ✓ SOLVED

Organizations struggle to gain comprehensive visibility into cluster costs across pods and nodes due to diverse consumption patterns.

**Cluster Orchestrator Solution**: Granular cost attribution with team/project tagging capabilities and customizable dashboards that provide real-time cost insights down to the pod level, enabling accurate chargeback models.

#### 3. Resource Optimization ✓ SOLVED

Persistent overprovisioning of workloads and nodes leads to significant cloud waste, while choosing between instance types adds complexity.

**Cluster Orchestrator Solution**: Intelligent bin-packing algorithms that maximize node utilization and automatically select the optimal mix of On-Demand, Reserved, and Spot instances based on workload characteristics and business priorities.

#### 4. Pod-to-Node Orchestration ✓ SOLVED

Kubernetes' native horizontal (HPA) and vertical (VPA) pod autoscaling often create mismatches with available node resources.

**Cluster Orchestrator Solution**: Seamless coordination between pod autoscaling and node provisioning through workload-aware node groups that ensure pods always have the right infrastructure, eliminating pending pods and reducing deployment disruptions by 95%.

## Harness Cluster Orchestrator for Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)

The **Harness Cluster Orchestrator** for Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), a component of the Harness Cloud Cost Management (CCM) module, is designed to tackle the obstacles listed above. It **intelligently scales EKS cluster nodes** according to actual workload requirements. Additionally, by leveraging CCM's **distributed Spot orchestration capability**, you can **save up to 90% on cloud costs** with Amazon EC2 Spot Instances.

It also facilitates **workload-driven autoscaling**, dynamically adjusting cluster resources to match workload demands while optimizing the utilization of AWS Spot instances. This approach ensures **efficient resource allocation** and **cost-effective cluster management**. Harness' Cluster Orchestrator for Amazon EKS **distinguishes itself** from other solutions in the market because of additional features like **distributed spot orchestration**.

> ### AWS Service Ready Partner
