Fallback policies in Cluster Orchestrator define how your workloads respond when AWS Spot Instances are interrupted. These policies ensure continuous application availability while maximizing cost savings through intelligent instance management.

## How Fallback Works

When AWS issues a Spot Instance interruption notice (typically with a two-minute warning), Cluster Orchestrator implements a fallback strategy:

1. **Interruption Detection**: The system detects the AWS interruption signal
2. **Replacement Search**: It immediately searches for alternative Spot Instances
3. **On-Demand Fallback**: If suitable Spot capacity isn't available, it automatically provisions On-Demand instances
4. **Workload Migration**: Application workloads are gracefully migrated to the new instances

This process happens automatically, ensuring your applications remain available even when Spot Instances are reclaimed by AWS.

The diagram illustrates how Cluster Orchestrator handles Spot Instance interruptions, from detection to workload migration, ensuring continuous application availability.

## Reverse Fallback

Cluster Orchestrator doesn't stop at fallback, it continues to optimize costs through reverse fallback:

- When Spot nodes are interrupted, they are automatically replaced with On-Demand nodes to maintain application stability
- Once Spot capacity becomes available again, the system performs a reverse fallback, replacing the On-Demand node with a Spot node
- Users can select the retry interval to define how often the system checks for Spot capacity and performs the reverse fallback

## Configuring Fallback Policies

### Retry Interval Settings

The retry interval determines how frequently Cluster Orchestrator checks for available Spot capacity after falling back to On-Demand instances. You can configure this interval based on your cost optimization goals and workload characteristics:

- **Short intervals** (e.g., 15-30 minutes): More aggressive cost optimization, with more frequent attempts to return to Spot Instances
- **Medium intervals** (e.g., 1-3 hours): Balanced approach that reduces API calls while still seeking cost savings
- **Long intervals** (e.g., 12-24 hours): More conservative approach that prioritizes stability over frequent instance changes

### Fallback Instance Types

You can also configure which instance types Cluster Orchestrator should consider when falling back to On-Demand instances:

- **Same instance family**: Ensures consistent performance characteristics
- **Equivalent performance**: Allows for flexibility across instance families with similar capabilities
- **Custom selection**: Specify exactly which instance types are acceptable for fallback
