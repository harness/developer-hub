  <TabItem value="Granular permissions support for AWS Autostopping">We have introduced Granular permissions support for AWS Autostopping. With this update, users can now select the specific AWS resource types they want to enable for Autostopping such as EC2, ASG, or RDS. Based on the selected resource types, only the minimal required set of permissions will be requested.  </TabItem>

## What Are AutoStopping Rules?

**AutoStopping Rules** are dynamic, intelligent orchestrators designed to manage non-production cloud workloads efficiently. They automatically shut down idle resources and seamlessly restart them when needed including running workloads on **spot instances** without worrying about interruptions.

## Why Use AutoStopping Rules?

AutoStopping Rules help ensure you're only **paying for resources when they're actually in use**. Here's what they bring to your cloud cost optimization strategy:

- **No More Cloud Waste**: Automatically shut down or terminate idle cloud resources.
- **Save Up to 70%** on Non-Production Cloud Costs.
- **Run on Spot Instances** without risk — full orchestration ensures reliability.
- **Auto-Resume Access**: Resources remain accessible using familiar methods (DNS, SSH, RDP), even after being stopped or terminated.
- **No Manual Intervention**: Once configured, everything works automatically — no need to remember to shut things off.

## Key Problems Solved

AutoStopping Rules address the most common challenges teams face with idle resources:

- ❌ Manually predicting idle time is inaccurate and inefficient.
- ❌ Forceful shutdowns make machines inaccessible — blocking workflows.
- ❌ Basic start/stop automation doesn't optimize cloud spend or compute usage.
- ✅ **AutoStopping handles all of the above, intelligently and seamlessly.**

## Benefits of AutoStopping Rules

- **Real savings**: Cut cloud bills by over 70%.
- **Set-and-forget automation**: Zero manual overhead after initial setup.
- **No more forgotten VMs**: Enforces policies so idle resources don’t keep burning money.
- **Easy integration** with Terraform or existing provisioning workflows.
- **Access preserved**: Continue using DNS links, SSH, RDP — even after resources restart.

## Where Can You Use AutoStopping Rules?

| Cloud Provider | Supported Resources |
|----------------|---------------------|
| **AWS**        | EC2, Auto Scaling Groups, Kubernetes (EKS), ECS Services, RDS Instances |
| **Azure**      | On-demand VMs, Kubernetes Clusters (AKS) |
| **GCP**        | GCE VMs, Kubernetes Clusters (GKE) |

> **Note:**  
> - There's **no limit** on the number of dependencies a rule can manage.  
> - **RDS warm-up time** depends on cluster/instance size (~25 minutes).  
> - Other resources warm up in under 2 minutes (max 5 minutes).
