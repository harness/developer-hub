## Prerequisites
   * You must provide the required permissions to Harness to create an instance in your GCP account.
   * You must provide the required permissions to read the secrets and fetch the certificates stored in the secret for TLS-based flows.
   * Ensure that you reserve some IPs if you intend to allocate elastic IP while creating an AutoStopping proxy.

## Creating an AutoStopping Rule for RDS

1. In Harness, navigate to **Cloud Costs** module -> **AutoStopping Rules**
2. Click **New AutoStopping Rule**
3. Select **GCP** as your cloud provider. Choose an existing GCP connector or click **New Connector** to [create one](/docs/cloud-cost-management/get-started/onboarding-guide/set-up-cost-visibility-for-gcp). 

After this, there are 3 simple steps to set up your AutoStopping rule:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="configuration" label="Step 1: Configuration">

1. Enter a **Name** for your rule
2. Set the **Idle Time** - how long an instance should be inactive before stopping
3. In the **Resources to be managed by the AutoStopping rules** section, select "Compute Engine VM(s)". 
4. Click on **+ Add an instance**. Add the instances that you want to manage by this rule.
5.  Set up Advanced Configuration: 
    - Hide Progress Page: This is especially useful when the service is invoked by an automation system, as it prevents misinterpretation of the progress page as the intended response from a service that is onboarded to AutoStopping.
    - Dry-Run: Toggle the button if you wish to evaluate this feature without terminating your cloud resources. For more information, go to Evaluate AutoStopping rules in dry-run mode.
    - Dependencies: Link your rule to other AutoStopping rules when resources depend on each other.
    - Fixed Schedules: Create fixed schedules to automatically start or stop your instances at specific times.

Choose how users will access your VM instances:

#### **Setup Access for TCP workload or SSH/RDP**

Setting up access for TCP workload or SSH/RDP allows AutoStopping to detect activity and idleness, and ensure that the database is up and running only when you need it. Use the AutoStopping Proxy URL (IP/Hostname of the Proxy and a unique autogenerated port number) for this AutoStopping Rule when you connect to the RDS database using any database client. The Proxy URL is generated when you save the AutoStopping Rule. If you need to access the resources managed by this AutoStopping rule using TCP or SSH/RDP HTTPS URL, you need to perform the following steps:

- Choose an AutoStopping Proxy from the Specify AutoStopping Proxy dropdown list to set up access.
- Toggle SSH or RDP to specify the listening ports. The port number is autopopulated based on the security group.
- Specify the source port numbers and the target TCP ports your application is listening to. If the source port is not specified, a random port will be generated at the backend. This auto-generated port will continue to be used as long as the target port remains unchanged or unless the user explicitly modifies the source port.
- Click Next.

#### Set up access for HTTP/HTTPS workload

If you need to access the resources managed by this AutoStopping rule using an HTTP or HTTPS URL, you need to perform the following steps:

Choose an AutoStopping Proxy from the dropdown list to set up access.

#### SSH/RDP Access (AutoStopping Proxy)

<details>
<summary>Click to expand SSH/RDP access configuration details</summary>

#### Enter Routing Configuration and Health Check Details

1. If the security groups are configured for the selected instances, then the routing information is auto-populated for those instances.  
   You can edit or delete the routing information. However, it is mandatory to have at least one port listed.

   This is the load balancer routing configuration for the underlying application that is running on the cloud resources managed by this AutoStopping rule.


2. Click **Add** if you wish to add more ports. The following are some points to consider:  
   - If you are forwarding the same action to different ports, then specify the server name and/or path match.  
   - If you specify the server name, then the host uses the custom URL to access the resources. You cannot use an auto-generated URL to access the resources.

3. Toggle the **Health check** button to configure the health check. Health check status should be successful for the AutoStopping rules to come into effect. Set a health check for the underlying application that is running on the cloud resources managed by this AutoStopping rule. The load balancer periodically sends requests as per the settings below to the application. If your application does not support health check, or you do not have any application running, you can disable the health check.

   By default, the health check is turned on.

4. In Protocol, select **http** or **https**.
5. Enter Path, port, and timeout details. For example, if you have configured port 80 and the timeout as 30 seconds for your instance, then the AutoStopping rule checks these specified parameters before bringing AutoStopping Rule into effect.

#### Specify the URL to access the resources

You can use either of the following methods:

- Auto-generated URL
- Custom URL

**Auto-generated URL**

Every AutoStopping rule has an auto-generated URL. This URL is a subdomain to the domain name specified for the load balancer. Since the load balancer configures a wildcard domain such as `*.autostopping.yourcompany.com`, the auto-generated URL works automatically and point to the correct load balancer.

Select **Use the auto-generated URL to access the resources managed by this AutoStopping Rule**.

**Custom URL**

AutoStopping rule can use multiple custom domains. In such a case, it should be configured in the DNS provider. AutoStopping Rules also allows you to use custom domains or change the root of your site's URL from the default, like,`autostop.harness.io`, to any domain you own. To point your site's default domain to a custom domain, you can set it up in your DNS provider.

Enter the custom URL currently used to access the instances. The domain name should be entered without prefixing the scheme. A rule can have multiple URLs. You can enter comma-separated values into a custom URL to support multiple URLs.

In Review, verify all the configuration details and click **Save Rule**. To edit any of the configuration settings, click **EDIT** and modify the settings.

Your AutoStopping rule is listed under the AutoStopping Rules dashboard.

## Use the Harness CLI to access resources through SSH/RDP 


SSH/RDP allows you to access the resources managed by the AutoStopping rule via SSH or RDP HTTPS URL. Select this option if the underlying applications running on the resources managed by AutoStopping Rule are accessed via SSH or RDP.


1. In **Setup Access**, select **SSH/RDP**.
2. Select your operating system to download the Harness CLI for your system.

3. Click **Download CLI**.
4. You can connect using SSH or RDP.

#### SSH commands


To connect to remote servers via SSH/RDP, such as PuTTY, use the Harness CLI `connect` command. The `connect` command opens a proxy connection in your machine which can be used from other applications.




```
harness connect --host hostname --port <ssh/rdp port>
```
You can simply copy the hostname from the AutoStopping Rule dashboard view. Click on the AutoStopping Rule that you want to connect and copy the hostname.


![](./static/create-auto-stopping-rules-for-gcp-30.png)


 For example:




```
harness connect --host default-test-ssh-1.abc1000test.lightwingtest.com --port 22 -- -i ~/.ssh/ry-jupyter.pem
```
Here is the output:




```
Proxy listening details: 
   Rule name:           Test SSH 1 
   Listen address:      127.0.0.1 
   Port forwarding:     14527 => 22 
   Protocol:            tcp 
   Started at:          2021-05-19 21:53:38.320943 +0530 IST m=+48.950643931
```
Harness `connect` created a secure tunnel from your computer to the given port after bringing up the VM. Now open the RDP/SSH client and use the hostname and port information provided above to connect.


```
harness ssh --host default-test-ssh-1.abc1000test.lightwingtest.com --user ubuntu --config lwc.toml -- -i ~/.ssh/ry-jupyter.pem
```
#### RDP commands

For RDP run the following command:

```
harness rdp --host default-test-rdp-1.abc1000test.lightwingtest.com
```
Run the following command to connect via private IP:




```
harness rdp --host default-test-rdp-1.abc1000test.lightwingtest.com --internal-ip
```
