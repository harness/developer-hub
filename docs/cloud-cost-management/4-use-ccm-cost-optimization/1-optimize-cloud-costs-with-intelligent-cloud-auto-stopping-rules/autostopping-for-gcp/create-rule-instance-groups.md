## Prerequisites

   * You must provide the required permissions to Harness to create an instance in your GCP account.
   * You must provide the required permissions to read the secrets and fetch the certificates stored in the secret for TLS-based flows.
   * Ensure that you reserve some IPs if you intend to allocate elastic IP while creating an AutoStopping proxy.


## Creating an AutoStopping Rule for RDS

1. In Harness, navigate to **Cloud Costs** module -> **AutoStopping Rules**
2. Click **New AutoStopping Rule**
3. Select **GCP** as your cloud provider. Choose an existing GCP connector or click **New Connector** to [create one](/docs/cloud-cost-management/get-started/onboarding-guide/set-up-cost-visibility-for-gcp). 

After this, there are 3 simple steps to set up your AutoStopping rule:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="configuration" label="Step 1: Configuration">

1. Enter a **Name** for your rule
2. Set the **Idle Time** - how long an instance should be inactive before stopping
3. In the **Resources to be managed by the AutoStopping rules** section, select "Instance groups". 
4. Click on **+ Add an Instance group**. Add the instance group that you want to manage by this rule.
5. Choose to convert the selected instance(s) to spot or remain on-demand.
6.  Set up Advanced Configuration: 
    - Hide Progress Page: This is especially useful when the service is invoked by an automation system, as it prevents misinterpretation of the progress page as the intended response from a service that is onboarded to AutoStopping.
    - Dry-Run: Toggle the button if you wish to evaluate this feature without terminating your cloud resources. For more information, go to Evaluate AutoStopping rules in dry-run mode.
    - Dependencies: Link your rule to other AutoStopping rules when resources depend on each other.
    - Fixed Schedules: Create fixed schedules to automatically start or stop your instances at specific times.

<TabItem value="access" label="Step 2: Setup Access">

1. InÂ **Setup Access**, select **Proxy** from drop-down list or [create a new one](docs/cloud-cost-management/use-ccm-cost-optimization/optimize-cloud-costs-with-intelligent-cloud-auto-stopping-rules/autostopping-for-aws/autostopping-proxy).
2. Click on Next.

In Review, verify all the configuration details and click **Save Rule**. To edit any of the configuration settings, click **EDIT** and modify the settings.

Your AutoStopping rule is listed under the AutoStopping Rules dashboard.
