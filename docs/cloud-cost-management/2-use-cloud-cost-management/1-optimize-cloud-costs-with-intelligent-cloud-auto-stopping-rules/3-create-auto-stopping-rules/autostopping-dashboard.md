AutoStopping Rules make sure that your non-production resources run only when used, and never when idle. It also allows you to run your workloads on fully orchestrated spot instances without any worry of spot interruptions.

AutoStopping dashboard allows you to view a summary of all the AutoStopping rules you have created in a simple and intuitive interface. The following are the key features of the AutoStopping Rules dashboard:

* View total savings in your setup after AutoStopping rules are created
* View total spend in your setup after AutoStopping rules are created
* Number of instances managed using AutoStopping rules
* State of the instances where AutoStopping rules are applied
* Number of active AutoStopping rules in your setup

You can also perform the following actions from the AutoStopping dashboard view:

* Start the instances that are in a stopped state
* Edit or delete an AutoStopping rule
* Enable or disable an AutoStopping rule

### View the AutoStopping Rules Dashboard

The **AutoStopping Summary of Rules dashboard** displays data as a chart and table. You can view, understand, and analyze your usage and cost data using either of them. However, the table allows you to view granular details.

1. In **AutoStopping Rules**, in **Summary of Rules**, click the instance for which you want to view the details.

2. In **Spend vs Saving**, view the spend and savings data of seven days for the selected rule. The savings are calculated as the following:

* The actual and potential costs of the VM are used to calculate savings.
	+ Your actual hourly cost multiplied by 24 equals your potential daily cost.
	+ The actual cost is the amount paid to the cloud provider for the number of hours actually used. This information comes from the AutoStopping usage records.  
	  
	
	```
	Potential cost = Actual hourly cost * 24
	```
	  
	With potential and actual cost, the savings are calculated.  
	  
	
	```
	Savings = Potential cost - Actual cost
	```
