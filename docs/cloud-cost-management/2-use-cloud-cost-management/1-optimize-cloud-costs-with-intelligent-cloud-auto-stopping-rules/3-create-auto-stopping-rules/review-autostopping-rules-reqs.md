This topic covers the requirements for creating [AutoStopping Rules](../1-add-connectors/1-auto-stopping-rules.md) on all supported cloud platforms. Before you begin creating AutoStopping Rules, make sure you've reviewed the following:

* Prerequisites
* Questionnaire about your cloud setup and resources

### AWS: EC2 VMs and Auto Scaling Groups

Review the following prerequisites and set up related questions.

#### Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are needed:

* Ensure that you have AWS EC2 VMs or Auto Scaling Groups created
* Ensure that you have access to CUR. See [Review: Cost and Usage Reports (CUR) and CCM Requirements](https://ngdocs.harness.io/article/80vbt5jv0q-set-up-cost-visibility-for-aws#review_cost_and_usage_reports_cur_and_ccm_requirements)
* Permissions to create a cross-account role. See [AWS Access Permissions](https://ngdocs.harness.io/article/80vbt5jv0q-set-up-cost-visibility-for-aws#aws_resource_optimization_using_auto_stopping_rules)

#### Questionnaire





* How are the VMs accessed?
  1. DNS link
  2. SSH
  3. RDP
 
* What is the protocol used for accessing these VMs?
  1. HTTP/HTTPS
  2. TCP (SSH, RDP, etc.)
 
* Do you use a load balancer like ALB for non-prod workloads? 
* Do you use Route53 to manage DNS? 
* What is the life cycle of these VMS?
  1. Short-lived and dynamically created (ephemeral instances, created via deployment scripts, etc..)
  2. Long-lived static environments
 |
* Do you use AWS Gov Cloud? 
* Are these VMs shut down during non-working hours? 
* Do you use Reserved instances for non-prod workloads? 
* Do you use Spot instances? 
* What is the platform type that you use?
  1. Windows
  2. Linux
 
* How many developers access the instances? 
* What is the number of instances? 

### Amazon ECS

Review the following prerequisites.

#### Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are needed:
* See [Set up cost visibility for AWS](../../../1-onboard-with-cloud-cost-management/set-up-cloud-cost-management/set-up-cost-visibility-for-aws.md) for the following topics:
	* Access to CUR. See Cost and Usage Reports (CUR) and CCM Requirements.
	* Permissions to create a cross-account role. See AWS Access Permissions.
	* Permissions for AWS ECS and Resource Inventory Management. See AWS ECS and Resource Inventory Management.
	* Permissions for AWS Resource Optimization Using AutoStopping Rules. See AWS Resource Optimization Using AutoStopping Rules.
* HTTP/HTTPS-based applications running on ECS
* ECS running on EC2 nodes or Fargate

### Azure

Review the following prerequisites and set up related questions.

#### Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are needed:

* Ensure that you have Azure on-demand VMs created
* Make sure that you have the **Application Administrator** role assigned for your Azure AD. Users in this role can create and manage all aspects of enterprise applications, application registrations, and application proxy settings. See [Application Administrator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#application-administrator)
* Many Azure CLI commands act within a subscription. Ensure that you have selected the right subscription before executing the commands. If you need to switch the subscription, use the following command:  
`az account set -s <`*`subs id/name`*`>`  
For more information, see [Manage Subscriptions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/manage-azure-subscriptions-azure-cli)
* Permissions to create an application gateway:
	+ A dedicated subnet with no other resources
	+ A public IP belonging to the same VPN as the application gateway
		- SKU: Basic for V1 Application gateway and Standard for V2 application gateway
		- Type: Static or Dynamic
* Permissions to create Azure function and a dedicated storage account
* SSL certificate in **\*.pfx** format to support HTTPS traffic if required. You can use a wild card certificate or specific to the domain certificate

#### Questionnaire




* How are the VMs accessed?
  1. DNS link
  2. SSH
  3. RDP
 
* What is the protocol used for accessing these VMs?
  1. HTTP/HTTPS
  2. TCP (SSH, RDP, etc.)
 
* Do you use an ApplicationGateway or WAF for non-prod workloads? 
* Are the VMs publicly accessible? 
* What DNS provider do you currently use? 
* What is the life cycle of these VMS?
  1. Short-lived and dynamically created (ephemeral instances, created via deployment scripts, etc..)
  2. Long-lived static environments
 
* Are these VMs shut down during non-working hours? 
* Do you use Reserved Instances for non-prod workloads? 
* Do you use Spot instances? 
* What is the platform type that you use?
  1. Windows
  2. Linux
 
* How many developers access the instances? 
* What is the number of instances? 

### Kubernetes Clusters

Review the following prerequisites and set up related questions.

#### Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are needed:

* Ingress controller installed. For more information, go to [Supported Ingress Controllers for Kubernetes AutoStopping](https://docs.harness.io/article/1e536z41av-supported-platforms-and-technologies#cloud_cost_management).
* Ensure that you have Cluster Autoscaler enabled for EKS with managed node groups
* For EKS:
	+ Ensure that you have access to (Cost Usage Report) CUR. See [Review: Cost and Usage Reports (CUR) and CCM Requirements](../../../1-onboard-with-cloud-cost-management/set-up-cloud-cost-management/set-up-cost-visibility-for-aws.md)
	+ Permissions to create a cross-account role. See [AWS Access Permissions](../../../1-onboard-with-cloud-cost-management/set-up-cloud-cost-management/set-up-cost-visibility-for-aws.md)
