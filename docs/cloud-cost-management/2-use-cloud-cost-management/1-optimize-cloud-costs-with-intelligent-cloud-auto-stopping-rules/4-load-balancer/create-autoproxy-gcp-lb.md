An AutoStopping proxy load balancer automatically distributes user traffic across multiple instances of your applications coupled with the capabilities of the CCM AutoStopping feature that makes sure that your non-production resources run only when used. Load balancing reduces the chances of performance issues in your applications by spreading the load.

You can create a custom load balancer using the AutoStopping proxy option. This feature allows you to launch a VM with the load balancer. 

Perform the following steps to create an AutoStopping proxy for your resources in GCP:  

1. In **Harness**, go to the **Cloud Costs** module.
2. Under **Setup**, click **Load Balancers**.
3. Click **Create New Load Balancer**.
4. Select **GCP**.
5. Choose an existing connector or [create a new one](/docs/cloud-cost-management/2-use-cloud-cost-management/1-optimize-cloud-costs-with-intelligent-cloud-auto-stopping-rules/1-add-connectors/create-a-gcp-connector-for-auto-stopping-rules.md).
6. Click **Create AutoStopping Proxy**.
7. In the **Create a new AutoStopping Proxy** window, enter the following information:
    1. Provide a name for the AutoStopping Proxy.
    2. Enter the URL to specify the domain. Make sure that you have updated the DNS mapping in your DNS provider.
    3. Click **Continue**.

8. Select the region where you have your cloud resources hosted.
9. Select the zone from the dropdown list.
10. Select the **VPC** and **Subnet** to which the resource belongs.
11. Select the **Network tags** to enable ports on the proxy VM which would be receiving traffic or which would be used to access the proxy.
12. Select the **Virtual Network**.
13. In the **Machine type** dropdown list, select the instance type.
14. **TLS Certificate Secret Version**: Create a secret in your GCP account. Go to [Create a secret](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager/docs/creating-and-accessing-secrets). Enter the **Resource ID** displayed in the **Overview** tab.


:::note
Ensure that the file uploaded in the Secret value field is not encrypted or encoded. It must be a plaintext certificate.

15. **TLS Private Key Secret Version**: Create another secret for private key and enter the resource ID in this field.
16. **API Key**: Enter a valid NG API key. Choose **No Expiration** in the Expiration dropdown list while creating this API key. Go to [Create an API Key](/docs/platform/16_APIs/api-quickstart.md) for more information.

17. Enable **Allocate Static IP** if you need to assign an elastic IP address to make the VM publicly accessible. Update the DNS route to point to the public IP. You don't need to enable this field it is pointing to a private IP provided the DNS resolves. For example, when the DNS resolution is done within the VPC.
18. Click **Save Load Balancer**.
