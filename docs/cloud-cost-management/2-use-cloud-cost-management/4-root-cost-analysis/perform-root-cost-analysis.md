Most cost reporting tools provide a high-level view of resource consumption that is useful for seeing the big picture. But these tools are not helpful when you want to see the low-level, root causes of your cloud costs.

Harness Cloud Cost Management (CCM) lets you drill down to see which clusters, namespaces, nodes, tasks, workloads, labels, storage, and Harness components are costing you the most money.

With CCM, you can find the low-level root cause of your cloud costs and reduce unnecessary consumption.

### Option: Root Cost Analysis for Clusters

Perspectives provide deep insights into your total, idle, utilized, and unallocated cluster costs. You pick a cluster to analyze and then drill down into its components to see where you're spending money.

Each of the cluster's components is exposed, along with its costs.

The following steps take you through the process.

1. Navigate to **Cloud Cost Management** module and click **Perspectives.**
2. Click the Perspective with your clusters as Data Sources, for which you want to analyze the cost**.** Perspectives provide a single-pane view of the costs for different products, for example, clusters, applications, AWS, GCP, and Azure. See [Create Cost Perspectives](/docs/cloud-cost-management/2-use-cloud-cost-management/2-ccm-perspectives/1-create-cost-perspectives.md).
   
     ![](./static/perform-root-cost-analysis-24.png)
3. Select the **date range** for the costs you want to analyze. You can either click **Select custom range** to customize the date range or select an option from the pre-defined list.
   
     ![](./static/perform-root-cost-analysis-25.png)
4. In **Group by**, select one of the following options to view the costs:
	* **Cluster Name**: Total cost, Cost trend, Idle cost, Unallocated cost, and efficiency score for each cluster name.
	* **Namespace**: The cost of each Kubernetes namespace in the cluster. This does not apply to ECS clusters.
	* **Namespace ID**: The cost of each Kubernetes namespace Id in the cluster.
	* **Workload**: The cost of each Kubernetes workload or ECS service. You can see the workload type also. Workloads identified by Pod as Kubernetes pods or ECS tasks.
	* **Workload ID**: The cost of each Kubernetes workload ID.
	* **Node**: The cost of each Kubernetes node or ECS instance.
	* **Storage**: These are the cost of the persistent volumes present in your Kubernetes cluster. For more information, see [Persistent Volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/).
	* **Application**: These are the sum of your Harness Application costs. The supported Group by filters are, Application, Service, Environment, Tag, and Cloud Provider.
	* **Environment**: Environments organize and name the deployment infrastructures in your cloud platforms, such as Dev, QA, Stage, Production, etc. These are your cloud platform infrastructures costs, grouped by team, department, and so on.
	* **Service**: Services represent your microservices and applications. These are your microservice costs.
	* **Cloud Provider**: These are your cloud platform costs. Cloud Providers describe your public or private cloud or physical infrastructures, like AWS and Kubernetes.
	* **ECS Service**: The cost of an ECS service that specifies the number of task definition instances running in an Amazon ECS cluster. For a detailed description of ECS services, see [Services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html) from AWS.
	* **ECS Launch Type:** The cost of an Amazon ECS launch type. An Amazon ECS launch type determines the type of infrastructure on which your tasks and services are hosted. There are two types:
		+ Fargate - Run containers without having to manage servers or clusters of Amazon EC2 instances.
		+ EC2 - Run containers on a cluster of Amazon EC2 instances that you manage.
	* **Region**: Each Cluster region you are currently running services in.
	* **Product**: Each of your active products with its cloud costs.
	* **Label**: Each label that you assign to your Cluster resources. You can select a label name to get further granular details of your label.
