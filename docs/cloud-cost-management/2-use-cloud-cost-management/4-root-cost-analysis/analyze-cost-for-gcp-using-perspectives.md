Harness Cloud Cost Management (CCM) allows you to view your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) costs, understand what is costing the most, and analyze cost trends. CE displays data for all your GCP products (such as Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, BigQuery, and so on), projects, SKUs, location, and labels and also provides details on:

* GCP cloud cost spending trends
* The GCP products costing the most in a selected time range. For example, how much Compute Engine cost last week
* Primary cost contributors, such as product, project, SKUs, or region
* GCP spendings by region, such as us-west1 or us-east4

Time periods in the GCP Cloud Billing report use the Pacific Time Zone (PST) and observe daylight saving time shifts. However, Harness CCM explorer uses the UTC time zone. You may notice some cloud cost differences between Harness CCM explorer and the GCP Cloud Billing report due to the time zone difference.

### Before You Begin

3. You can use the following options to Group By:
	* **GCP**: Under AWS, you can Group by:
		+ **Products**: Each of your active products with their cloud costs is displayed.
		+ **Projects**: Each of your Cloud projects with their cloud costs is displayed.
		+ **SKUs**: Each [SKU](https://cloud.google.com/skus) you are using.
	* **Region**: Each GCP region you are currently running services in.
	* **Product**: Each of your active products with its cloud costs.
	* **Label**: Each [label](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-labels) that you are using to organize your Google Cloud instances.
