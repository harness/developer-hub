Harness CCM Budgets allow you to set custom budgets and receive alerts when your costs exceed (or are forecasted to exceed) your budget. Budgets are created on Perspectives. If you do not have a Perspective of the resources you would like to budget, [create a new Perspective](1-create-cost-perspectives.md) and then proceed to set a budget.

This topic describes how to create a new budget.

## Create a New Budget

:::note
You can add multiple budgets for a single Perspective.
:::
Perform the following steps to create a budget:
1. If you do not have a Perspective of the resources you would like to budget, [create a new Perspective](1-create-cost-perspectives.md) and then proceed to set a budget.
   After creating a Perspective, in **Perspective Builder**, click **Next**.
2. If you wish to set a budget for an existing Perspective, select the Perspective for which you want to set a budget, and click **Edit**.

6. Click **Continue**.
7. In **Set Budget Amount**, do the following:
	1. In **Budget Period**, select the period for which you want to set the budget.
	2. Use the date picker to set the start date for your budget.
   	3. In **Budget Type**, select a budget type.  
	
		* **Specified Amount**: Enter the amount that you want to set as the budget limit.
		* **Previous Month Spend**: Sets the previous month spent as your budget.
	4. To add growth rate to your budgeted amount, select the checkbox **Add growth rate to budget amount**. Growth rate refers to the percentage change of the budgeted amount within the specified time period. When you've decided to add growth rate to the budget amount, specify the growth rate percentage.  
	
		1. In **Specify Growth rate**, enter the percentage of the growth rate to the budget amount.  
		  
		You can view the increased amount of your budget in the graph. The graph displays the amount and budget period. The following example considers a 5% increase to the monthly budget amount.

7. Click **Continue**.
8. In **Configure Alerts**, set a threshold for the **Percentage of Budget** based on the **Actual Cost** or **Forecasted Cost**. Harness sends alerts when the Actual Cost or Forecasted Cost exceeds the threshold.  
  
Harness sends an alert to the specified email addresses and Harness User Groups when the actual or forecasted cost exceeds a percentage of your monthly budget.
9. In **Send report to**, add email addresses to receive budget notifications.
