### AutoStopping for Azure VMs: High-Level Overview

Harness manages the existing App Gateway within the customer environment. In cases where no App Gateway is present, Harness initiates the creation of a new one. Simultaneously, a freshly instantiated Proxy Manager comes into play, diligently tracking traffic directed towards the target resources.

#### Components and Flow:

1.  CCM Services:

-   A suite of CCM services collaborates seamlessly, orchestrating the AutoStopping mechanism tailored for Azure VMs. These services serve as the backbone, driving automation and intelligence.

2.  Customer Infrastructure:

-   The customer's infrastructure houses Azure VMs, subject to AutoStopping rules defined by CCM.

3.  App Gateway Management by Harness:

-   Harness takes charge of managing the existing App Gateway within the customer environment during the onboarding process.

-   If no App Gateway is found, Harness proactively creates a new one, establishing a crucial element for directing and managing traffic.

4.  Proxy Manager Creation:

-   A newly created Proxy Manager becomes an essential component, actively tracking traffic directed towards Azure VMs.

-   The Proxy Manager's role is central to detecting and analyzing traffic patterns for effective AutoStopping actions.
