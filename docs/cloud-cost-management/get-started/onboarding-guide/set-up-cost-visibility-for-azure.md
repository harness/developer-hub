Harness Cloud Cost Management (CCM) monitors the cloud costs of your Azure services. Connect your Azure account and set up Billing Export to get insights into your cloud infrastructure and Azure services such as Storage accounts, Virtual machines, Containers, and so on. CCM also allows you to optimize your instances and AKS clusters using intelligent cloud [AutoStopping rules](/docs/cloud-cost-management/use-ccm-cost-optimization/optimize-cloud-costs-with-intelligent-cloud-auto-stopping-rules/create-auto-stopping-rules/create-auto-stopping-rules-for-azure) 

> **☆ NOTE —** After enabling CCM, it takes about 24 hours for the data to be available for viewing and analysis.


## Azure Connector requirements

* The same connector cannot be used in NextGen and FirstGen. For information on creating an Azure connector in the FirstGen see [Set Up Cost Visibility for Azure](../../../first-gen/cloud-cost-management/setup-cost-visibility/set-up-cost-visibility-for-azure.md).
* For CCM, Azure connectors are available only at the Account level in Harness.
* You can create multiple Azure connectors for each Harness Account.
* You can create multiple Azure connectors per Azure Tenant with unique subscription IDs. 
* If you have separate billing exports for each of your subscriptions in your Azure account, set up separate connectors in Harness to view the cloud cost of all the subscriptions in CCM.

## Prerequisites

* Make sure that you have the **Application Administrator** role assigned to your Azure AD. Users in this role can create and manage all aspects of enterprise applications, application registrations, and application proxy settings. See [Application Administrator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#application-administrator).
* Many Azure CLI commands act within a subscription. Make sure that you have selected the right subscription before executing the commands. If you need to switch subscription, use the following command:  
`az account set -s <`*`subs id/name`*`>`  
For more information, see [Manage Subscriptions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/manage-azure-subscriptions-azure-cli).

## Connect CCM to your Azure Account

To enable CCM for your Azure services (such as storage accounts, virtual machines, containers, and so on), you need to connect Harness to your Azure account.

Perform the following steps to connect to your Azure account:
1. Create a new Kubernetes connector using one of the two options below:

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';



<Tabs queryString="tab-number">
<TabItem value="4" label="From Account Settings">

1. Go to **Account Resources** > **Connectors**.
2. Select **+ New Connector**.
3. Under **Cloud Costs**, select **Azure**.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="5" label="From Cloud Costs">

1. Go to **Setup** > **Cloud Integration**.  
2. Select on **New Cluster/Cloud account**.
3. Select **Azure**.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

2. Perform the following tasks in the **Azure Connector** wizard.

### Overview
	 
1. In the **Azure Connector** wizard, in the **Overview** section, enter the following details:
	1. **Connector name**: Enter a name for the connector.
	2. **Azure Tenant ID**: Enter the Tenant ID of your Azure AD account. A tenant represents an organization. It's a dedicated instance of Azure AD that an organization or app developer receives at the beginning of a relationship with Microsoft. Each Azure AD tenant is distinct and separate from other Azure AD tenants. To find your tenant ID, do the following:
		1. Launch Azure Active Directory.
		2. Copy the tenant ID from the Tenant information.
		
	<img src={tenant_info} alt="A screenshot." height="400" width="400" />

	 If you don't find the tenant ID in the Azure console, run the `az account show` command using the Azure CLI.

### Create Service Principal and Assign Permissions

Harness uses a multi-tenant app to sync billing export data from the source storage account to Harness and to perform cost optimization functions. This involves the following steps:

* Register the Harness CCM application into your Azure account.
* Grant read permissions to the storage account in which the billing data export is available and/or assign `contributor` role to the subscription if the AutoStopping feature is being utilized.

Create a service principal and assign permissions by running the following commands in the bash terminal or in the Azure cloud shell.

#### Register the Harness Application

Run the following **bash** commands using your **bash** terminal or Azure cloud shell:

`az ad sp create --id 0211763d-24fb-4d63-865d-92f86f77e908`  
See **Azure client application ID**  in **Harness Platform** > **Connectors** > **Add a Microsoft Azure Cloud Connector** for more information.
> **☆ NOTE —** If you encounter the following error message, proceed with assigning permissions to the storage account.  
  `Another object with the same value for property servicePrincipalNames already exists.`  
  The error means that your Harness CCM application is already registered into your Azure account.
  
  
#### Assign Permissions to the Storage Accounts
1. Run the following **bash** commands using your **bash** terminal or Azure cloud shell:


```
SCOPE=`az storage account show --name <storage account name> --query "id" | xargs`

```


Provides scope for your storage account. Each role assignment in Azure needs a scope on which the permissions or role is applied. The output of this command is used in the next step.

  **Required Parameter**
   
   --name

  **Response**
```
$ SCOPE=`az storage account show --name test --query "id" | xargs`  
  
$ echo $SCOPE  
/subscriptions/XXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX/resourceGroups/<resourcegroupname>/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/<storage account name>
```
2.  `az role assignment create --assignee0211763d-24fb-4d63-865d-92f86f77e908--role 'Storage Blob Data Reader' --scope $SCOPE`

  Provides Storage Blob Data Reader permission to the Harness application on the scope fetched in the previous step.  
  This is the ID of the Harness CCM client application. Use `0211763d-24fb-4d63-865d-92f86f77e908`.

3. `az role assignment create --assignee 0211763d-24fb-4d63-865d-92f86f77e908 --role 'Reader' --scope /subscriptions/<Subscription ID>`

  (Optional) Run this command if you have opted for **Azure Inventory Management** in the Choosing Requirements step.

4. `az role assignment create --assignee 0211763d-24fb-4d63-865d-92f86f77e908 --role 'Contributor' --scope /subscriptions/<Subscription ID>`

 (Optional) You need to run this command only if you have selected **Azure Optimization by AutoStopping** in the Choosing Requirements step.
 
5. Select **Continue** in Harness.

### Test Connection

The connection is validated and verified in this step. After successful validation, and verification, select **Finish**.

Your connector is listed in the **Connectors**.

![](static/set-up-cost-visibility-for-azure-13.png)

### Troubleshooting

If you get the `When using this permission, the backing application of the service principal being created must in the local tenant` error, check if you have the **Application Administrator** role assigned for your Azure AD. Users in this role can create and manage all aspects of enterprise applications, application registrations, and application proxy settings. For more information, see [Application Administrator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#application-administrator).
