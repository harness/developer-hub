# Set up CCM for AWS

## Overview

Harness Cloud Cost Management (CCM) offers comprehensive solutions to manage and optimize the cloud costs of your Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure. CCM provides visibility, governance, and optimization of AWS services such as EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda, and others. CCM provides recommendations to effectively right-size your cloud resources to match the workload demands and optimizes the auto-scaling groups (ASGs), and EKS clusters using intelligent cloud AutoStopping rules.

:::info
After enabling CCM, it takes about 24 hours for the data to be available for viewing and analysis.
:::

## Prerequisites

### AWS Connector requirements

- For CCM, AWS connectors are available only at the Account level in Harness.
- If you have multiple AWS accounts, you may need to create multiple AWS connectors depending on desired functionality:
  - **Cost Visibility**: You may need to create one or multiple AWS connectors depending on the availability of consolidated billing. Go to **Cost and Usage Reports (CUR)** for more information.
  - **Resource Inventory Management**: You need to create an AWS connector for each account.
  - **Optimization by AutoStopping**: You need to create an AWS connector for each account.

### Required- Cost and Usage Reports (CUR)

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs queryString="tab-number">
<TabItem value="1" label="Multiple Accounts with Consolidated Billing">

- If you have [consolidated billing process](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/useconsolidatedbilling-procedure.html) enabled, then you need to create only a single CUR for the management account. This provides cost data for all member accounts in the organization.

- For the Cost Visibility feature alone, you will only need a single AWS connector configured with the management account CUR.

- In order to take advantage of other features such as Inventory Management and AutoStopping, you need to create a connector for each member account:
  - If you are using the UI to create the additional connectors, configure all connectors with the same management account CUR.
  - If you are using the API to create the additional connectors, you can omit billing information altogether.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="2" label="Multiple Accounts">

- If you do not have [consolidated billing process](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/useconsolidatedbilling-procedure.html) enabled, then you need to create a CUR for each linked account.

- Create an AWS connector for each AWS account, configured with the CUR for that account.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="3" label="Single Account">

- Create a single CUR for your AWS account.

- Create a single AWS connector configured with the CUR for your account.

### Step 3: Choose Requirements

Select the Cloud Cost Management features that you would like to enable, and then select **Continue**.

> **☆ NOTE —** Selecting features will add the necessary permissions to the IAM role in the next step. Cost Visibility permissions are required by default.

<DocImage path={require('./static/aws-connector-features.png')} width="100%" height="100%" title="Click to view full size image" />

Details about each feature are provided below:

| **Feature** | **Status** | **Permissions Involved** | **Permissions** |
|------------|------------|-------------------------|----------------|
| **Cost Visibility** | Required | • AWS costs by services, accounts, etc.<br/>• Cost perspective by various constructs<br/>• Cost anomaly detection<br/>• Budgets and forecasts<br/>• Email and Slack alerts<br/>• Savings plans coverage & utilization details<br/>• RI coverage & utilization details | Default from the Cost and Usage Report created in the previous step. This cannot be deselected. Please see [required permissions](/docs/cloud-cost-management/get-started/onboarding-guide/set-up-cost-visibility-for-aws?tab-number=4#1-cost-visibility-permissions) |
| **Resource Inventory Management** | Optional | • Breakdown by ECS cluster cost, Service, Task, and Launch Type (EC2, Fargate)<br/>• Insight into EC2 instances and their utilization<br/>• Access to AWS EC2 Inventory Cost, EBS Volumes and Snapshots inventory dashboards | Adding [these permissions](/docs/cloud-cost-management/get-started/onboarding-guide/set-up-cost-visibility-for-aws?tab-number=4#2-resource-inventory-management-permissions) to an IAM role in the next step. |
| **Optimization by AutoStopping** | Optional | • Orchestrate VMs and ASGs based on idleness<br/>• Run on fully orchestrated spot instances<br/>• Set dependencies between VMs<br/>• Granular savings visibility<br/>• Simple one-time setup | Adding [these permissions](/docs/cloud-cost-management/get-started/onboarding-guide/set-up-cost-visibility-for-aws?tab-number=4#4-autostopping-rules-permissions) to an IAM role in the next step. Also, if this option is selected, you can set up **Granular AutoStopping Permissions** in the next step. Please see [details here](/docs/cloud-cost-management/get-started/onboarding-guide/set-up-cost-visibility-for-aws#granular-permissions-for-autostopping). |
| **Cloud Governance** | Optional | • Asset Management (EC2, EBS, RDS, S3)<br/>• Automated Actions | Adding [these permissions](/docs/cloud-cost-management/get-started/onboarding-guide/set-up-cost-visibility-for-aws?tab-number=4#5-cloud-asset-governance-permissions) to an IAM role in the next step. |

### Step 4: Authentication (Conditional)

If you have selected **Optimization by AutoStopping**, **Cloud Governance** or **Commitment Orchestration**, in previous step, you can set up Authentication using OIDC. If not selected, this step will not be prompted.

You can enable authentication for your AWS account via

- Cross Account Role: Created with custom permissions
- OIDC Authentication: Federated access with no stored credentials

#### OIDC Authentication

:::info 
This feature is behind a Feature Flag `CCM_ENABLE_OIDC_AUTH_AWS`. Contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io) to enable it.
:::

<DocImage path={require('./static/oidc-aws.png')} width="100%" height="100%" title="Click to view full size image" />

OIDC authentication allows secure access your billing data and perform cost optimization without storing credentials. 

To use OIDC, you need to create an [OIDC identity provider in AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_oidc.html). 

Use the following Harness OIDC provider endpoint and OIDC audience settings to create your OIDC identity provider:

- Harness OIDC provider endpoint: `https://app.harness.io/ng/api/oidc/account/<ACCOUNT_ID>`
- OIDC audience: `sts.amazonaws.com`

Follow the steps on the **Authentication** page to complete OIDC authentication:

- Launch the CloudFormation Template on the AWS console. You can also preview the template [here](https://continuous-efficiency.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/setup/v1/ng/HarnessAWSOidcTemplate.yaml).
- Login to your AWS account if not logged in already.
- Follow [the instructions to create the Cross Account Role](https://docs.harness.io/article/80vbt5jv0q-set-up-cost-visibility-for-aws#step_4_create_cross_account_role)
- Enter Cross Account Role ARN and Region in the input boxes on the UI.

### Step 5: Create Cross Account Role

Harness uses the secure cross-account role to access your AWS account. The role includes a restricted policy based on the features selected above.

1. In **Create Cross Account Role**, select **Launch Template on AWS console**.

Perform the following steps in the AWS Console.

2. In **Quick create stack**, in **Capabilities**, select the acknowledgment, and then select **Create stack**.
   > **☆ NOTE** - The values on this page are based on your previous selections. Do not modify any values before creating the stack.
3. In the stack's page, go to the **Outputs** tab and copy the **Value** of **CrossAccountRoleArn Key**.

   ![](./static/set-up-cost-visibility-for-aws-36.png)

4. In the Harness connector dialog, enter the following values, and then select **Save and Continue**.

<DocImage path={require('./static/aws-connector-four.png')} width="100%" height="100%" title="Click to view full size image" />

| **Field**                  | **Description**                                                                                                                            |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Cross Account Role ARN** | Enter the value that you copied in step 3.                                                                                                 |
| **External ID**            | Do not modify. If you intend to create multiple AWS connectors via API, be sure to copy this value as you will need to reference it later. |

### Step 5: Connection Test

The connection is validated, and verified in this step. After successful validation, select **Finish**.

:::important
Creating a new CUR (Cost and Usage Report) in AWS typically takes 6-8 hours. During this period, you might encounter an error message stating that Harness CCM is unable to find a CUR file.
:::

## Advanced Configuration

### Create Connectors for multiple AWS accounts

Harness CCM also provides the ability to create connectors via API using a StackSet configured at the management account. It involves the following steps:

- Create a Service Account and API Key in Harness
- Create a StackSet in AWS
- Create an AWS Connector via API (performed once for each AWS account)

> **☆ NOTE —** You should manually create a connector via the UI for the management account before using the API method described here to create connectors for the member accounts.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="step1" label="Step 1: Create a Service Account">

### Create a Service Account and API key in Harness

1. At the Account level, [create a service account](/docs/platform/role-based-access-control/add-and-manage-service-account) with the **Admin** role for **All Account Level Resources** or **All Resources Including Child Scopes**.
2. [Create a service account token](/docs/platform/automation/api/add-and-manage-api-keys#create-service-account-api-keys-and-tokens). Save the API Key, which will be used when creating AWS connectors via the API below.

### Enable EC2 recommendations

:::note
If you are an existing customer, you need to:

- Edit the IAM role used by the Harness AWS Connector corresponding to the AWS account.
- In the IAM role, add the `ce:GetRightsizingRecommendation` permission to the **HarnessEventsMonitoringPolicy**.
:::

Once you have the `ce:GetRightsizingRecommendation` permission added to the **HarnessEventsMonitoringPolicy** in the IAM role, perform the following tasks on your AWS console to enable recommendations.

1. On your AWS console, go to the **Cost Explorer** service.

<DocImage path={require('./static/ec2-recom-aws-screen-1.png')} width="50%" height="50%" title="Click to view full size image" />

2. Click **Preferences** on the left pane.
3. Enable the following recommendations:

- Receive Amazon EC2 resource recommendations
- Recommendations for linked accounts

<DocImage path={require('./static/ec2-recom-aws-screen-2.png')} width="50%" height="50%" title="Click to view full size image" />

4. Verify that you have enabled these recommendations correctly.

Open AWS CloudShell and run the following command:

```
  aws ce get-rightsizing-recommendation --service AmazonEC2
```

If the recommendations are not enabled, the following error message is displayed:

"An error occurred (AccessDeniedException) when calling the GetRightsizingRecommendation operation: Rightsizing EC2 recommendation is an opt-in only feature. You can enable this feature from the PAYER account’s Cost Explorer Preferences page. Normally it may take up to 24 hours in order to generate your rightsizing recommendations."

5. You must install the Amazon CloudWatch agent on your EC2 instance to enable memory metrics.

## Reference Information

## AWS access permissions

CCM requires the following permissions which are automatically created via a StackSet based on the features you select during configuration.

> **☆ NOTE —** If you don't have access to create a cost and usage report or run a CloudFormation template, contact your IT or security teams to provide the required permissions.

## Individual Feature Permissions

This section details the specific AWS permissions required for each CCM feature:

- [Cost Visibility Permissions](#1-cost-visibility-permissions)
- [Resource Inventory Management Permissions](#2-resource-inventory-management-permissions)
- [RDS Instance Visibility Permissions](#3-rds-instance-visibility-permissions)
- [AutoStopping Rules Permissions](#4-autostopping-rules-permissions)
- [Cloud Asset Governance Permissions](#5-cloud-asset-governance-permissions)
- [Commitment Orchestrator Permissions](#6-commitment-orchestrator-permissions)

## 1. Cost Visibility Permissions

The Cost Visibility feature provides insights into AWS costs by services, accounts, and other dimensions. It enables root cost analysis, anomaly detection, budgeting, and notifications.

#### Required Permissions

The cost visibility policy grants the following permissions:

- List CUR reports and visibility into the organization's Structure
- Get objects from the S3 bucket configured in the CUR
- Put objects into the Harness S3 bucket

<details>
<summary><b>Click to view Cost Visibility Policy</b></summary>

```yaml
  HarnessBillingMonitoringPolicy:
    "Type": "AWS::IAM::ManagedPolicy"
    "Condition": "CreatingHarnessBillingMonitoringPolicy"

      "PolicyDocument":
        "Version": "2012-10-17"
        "Statement":
          - "Effect": "Allow"
            "Action":
              - "s3:GetBucketLocation"
              - "s3:ListBucket"
              - "s3:GetObject"
            Resource:
              - !Join
                - ''
                - - 'arn:aws:s3:::'
                  - !Ref BucketName
              - !Join
                - /
                - - !Join

                    - - "arn:aws:s3:::"
                      - !Ref BucketName
                  - '*'
          - "Effect": "Allow"
            "Action":
              - "s3:ListBucket"
              - "s3:PutObject"
              - "s3:PutObjectAcl"
            "Resource":
              - "arn:aws:s3:::ce-customer-billing-data-prod*"
              - "arn:aws:s3:::ce-customer-billing-data-prod*/*"
          - "Effect": "Allow"
            "Action":
              - "cur:DescribeReportDefinitions"
              - "organizations:Describe*"
              - "organizations:List*"
            "Resource": "*"
      "Roles":
        - "!Ref HarnessCloudFormationRole"
```

</details>

If the `cur:DescribeReportDefinitions`, `organizations:Describe`, and `organizations:List*` permissions are too wide, you can modify these to the following:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "organizations:ListAccounts",
                "organizations:ListTagsForResource"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

- `organizations:ListAccounts`: fetches a list of all the accounts present in the organization, and also fetches the accountID to Account Name mapping.
- `organizations:ListTagsForResource`: fetches the AWS Account level tags. Harness supports account tags within CCM that can be used for reporting and analysis.

## 5. Cloud Asset Governance Permissions

For Cloud Asset Governance, add the [`ReadOnlyAccess`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/ReadOnlyAccess.html) policy to the IAM role or user used by Harness. This policy supplies the baseline read-only permissions needed.

:::info
Depending on your custom governance rules or automated actions, you may need to grant **additional permissions** beyond `ReadOnlyAccess`.
:::

## 6. Commitment Orchestrator Permissions

Step 1: Visibility

To enable visibility, in the master account connector, you need to add the following permissions.

```
"ec2:DescribeReservedInstancesOfferings",
"ce:GetSavingsPlansUtilization",
"ce:GetReservationUtilization",
"ec2:DescribeInstanceTypeOfferings",
"ce:GetDimensionValues",
"ce:GetSavingsPlansUtilizationDetails",
"ec2:DescribeReservedInstances",
"ce:GetReservationCoverage",
"ce:GetSavingsPlansCoverage",
"savingsplans:DescribeSavingsPlans",
"organizations:DescribeOrganization"
"ce:GetCostAndUsage"
```


Step 2: Setup flow (to enable actual orchestration)

```
"ec2:PurchaseReservedInstancesOffering",
"ec2:GetReservedInstancesExchangeQuote",
"ec2:DescribeInstanceTypeOfferings",
"ec2:AcceptReservedInstancesExchangeQuote",
"ec2:DescribeReservedInstancesModifications",
"ec2:ModifyReservedInstances"
"ce:GetCostAndUsage"
savingsplans:DescribeSavingsPlansOfferings
savingsplans:CreateSavingsPlan

```


## Troubleshooting

If you come across an error message indicating missing permissions, as displayed in the following screenshot, you need to add the missing permission [here](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home#/roles).

<DocImage path={require('./static/asset-governance-test-output-error.png')} width="50%" height="50%" title="Click to view full size image" />

1. Copy the role specified in the error message that requires permission to execute the rule.
2. Enter the role in IAM > Roles search box to filter the roles. The policies are displayed.

<DocImage path={require('./static/aws-missing-permission-role.png')} width="50%" height="50%" title="Click to view full size image" />

3. In the list of policies, select the policy to edit.
   <DocImage path={require('./static/aws-select-policy.png')} width="50%" height="50%" title="Click to view full size image" />

4. In the **Permissions** tab, select **Edit policy**, and then go to the **JSON** tab.

   <DocImage path={require('./static/aws-edit-json.png')} width="50%" height="50%" title="Click to view full size image" />

5. Add the missing permissions. You can use a wildcard (asterisk) to grant multiple permissions. For example, `s3:Get*` permission would allow multiple S3 actions that start with "Get".
6. Save changes.

For more information, go to [Editing IAM policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_manage-edit.html).

:::info 
- If you are using permission boundaries to enforce restrictions, ensure that Harness permissions are explicitly allowed to enable the connectors and functionalities to operate correctly.
