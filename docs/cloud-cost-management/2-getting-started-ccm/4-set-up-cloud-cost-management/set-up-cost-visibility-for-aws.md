# Set up CCM for AWS
Harness Cloud Cost Management (CCM) offers comprehensive solutions to manage and optimize the cloud costs of your Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure. CCM provides visibility, governance, and optimization of AWS services such as EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda, and others. CCM provides recommendations to effectively right-size your cloud resources to match the workload demands and optimizes the auto-scaling groups (ASGs), and EKS clusters using intelligent cloud AutoStopping rules.

> **☆ NOTE —** After enabling CCM, it takes about 24 hours for the data to be available for viewing and analysis.

## AWS Connector requirements

* The same connector cannot be used in NextGen and FirstGen. 
* For CCM, AWS connectors are available only at the Account level in Harness.
* If you have multiple AWS accounts, you may need to create multiple AWS connectors depending on desired functionality:
	+ **Cost Visibility**: You may need to create one or multiple AWS connectors depending on the availability of consolidated billing. Go to **Cost and Usage Reports (CUR)** for more information. 
	+ **Resource Inventory Management**: You need to create an AWS connector for each account.
	+ **Optimization by AutoStopping**: You need to create an AWS connector for each account.

## Cost and Usage Reports (CUR)

```mdx-code-block
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
```

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs queryString="tab-number">
<TabItem value="1" label="Multiple Accounts with Consolidated Billing">
```
* If you have [consolidated billing process](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/useconsolidatedbilling-procedure.html) enabled, then you need to create only a single CUR for the management account. This provides cost data for all member accounts in the organization.

* For the Cost Visibility feature alone, you will only need a single AWS connector configured with the management account CUR.

* In order to take advantage of other features such as Inventory Management and AutoStopping, you need to create a connector for each member account:
  * If you are using the UI to create the additional connectors, configure all connectors with the same management account CUR.
  * If you are using the API to create the additional connectors, you can omit billing information altogether.

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="2" label="Multiple Accounts">
```
* If you do not have [consolidated billing process](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/useconsolidatedbilling-procedure.html) enabled, then you need to create a CUR for each linked account.

* Create an AWS connector for each AWS account, configured with the CUR for that account.

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="3" label="Single Account">
```
* Create a single CUR for your AWS account.

* Create a single AWS connector configured with the CUR for your account.

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

:::


## Create Connectors for multiple AWS accounts

Harness CCM also provides the ability to create connectors via API using a StackSet configured at the management account. It involves the following steps:

* Create a Service Account and API Key in Harness
* Create a StackSet in AWS
* Create an AWS Connector via API (performed once for each AWS account)

> **☆ NOTE —** You should manually create a connector via the UI for the management account before using the API method described here to create connectors for the member accounts.

### Create a Service Account and API key in Harness

1. At the Account level, [create a Service Account](/docs/platform/User-Management/add-and-manage-service-account#create-a-service-account) with the **Admin** role for **All Account Level Resources** or **All Resources Including Child Scopes**.
2. [Create a Service Account Token](/docs/platform/User-Management/add-and-manage-service-account#create-a-service-account). Save the API Key, which will be used when creating AWS connectors via the API below.

### Create a StackSet in AWS

Perform the following steps to create a StackSet in AWS:

1. Select the following link to start creating the StackSet:  
<https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacksets/create>
2. In the **Choose a template** step, enter the following values, and then select **Next**.

| **Field** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Permissions** | Optional, configure if necessary based on your AWS policies. |
| **Prerequisite - Prepare template** | Select **Template is ready**. |
| **Specify template** | Select **Amazon S3 URL**. |
| **Amazon S3 URL** | Enter `https://continuous-efficiency-prod.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/setup/ngv1/HarnessAWSTemplate.yaml` |

3. In the **Specify StackSet details** step, enter the following values, and then select **Next**.

| **BillingEnabled** | Select **false**. |
| **BucketName** | Leave empty. |
| **EventsEnabled** | Select **true**. |
| **ExternalId** | The External ID value copied in step 4 of [Create Cross Account Role](#create-cross-account-role). |
| **GovernanceEnabled** | Select **true** to enable Governance. Otherwise, select **false**. |
| **LambdaExecutionRoleName** | Leave as is unless your AWS policies required a different naming convention. |
| **OptimizationEnabled** | Select **true** to enable AutoStopping. Otherwise, select **false**. |
| **PrincipalBilling** | Do not modify. |
| **RoleName** | Leave as is unless your AWS policies required a different naming convention. |
   
4. In the **Configure StackSet options** step, enter the following values and select **Next**

| **Field** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Managed execution** | Select **Active**. |
    
5. In the **Set deployment options** step, enter the following values, and then select **Next**.

### Create an AWS Connector via API

Use the Harness API's [Create a Connector](https://apidocs.harness.io/tag/Connectors#operation/createConnector) endpoint to create an AWS connector for each member account. Below is a sample cURL command to create an AWS connector. Replace the following placeholders with your values:

| **Placeholder** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **API TOKEN** | The API Key created in the [Create a Service Account and API Key in Harness](#create-a-service-account-and-api-key-in-harness) section. |
| **CONNECTOR NAME** | Enter any name. This will be visible in the UI, perspectives, dashboards, etc. |
| **CONNECTOR ID** | Enter a unique ID for the connector. The ID must meet the [Entity Identifier Reference](/docs/platform/references/entity-identifier-reference/) specification. |
| **CROSS ACCOUNT ROLE ARN** | The ARN value copied in step 3 of [Create Cross Account Role](#create-cross-account-role). |
| **EXTERNAL ID** | The External ID value copied in step 4 of [Create Cross Account Role](#create-cross-account-role). |
| **AWS ACCOUNT ID** | The ID of the AWS member account. |
| **FEATURES** | A comma separated list of features to enable. Enter `"VISIBILITY", "OPTIMIZATION", "GOVERNANCE"` removing any features that you do not want to enable. |


```
curl -i -X POST 'https://app.harness.io/gateway/ng/api/connectors' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'x-api-key: <API TOKEN>' \
  -d '{
  "connector":{
    "name":"<CONNECTOR NAME>",
    "identifier":"<CONNECTOR ID>",
    "type":"CEAws",
    "spec":{
      "crossAccountAccess":{
        "crossAccountRoleArn":"<CROSS ACCOUNT ROLE ARN>",
        "externalId":"<EXTERNAL ID>"
      },
      "awsAccountId":"<AWS ACCOUNT ID>",
      "curAttributes":{
        "reportName":"",
        "s3BucketName":""
      },
      "featuresEnabled":[
        <FEATURES>
      ]
    }
  }
}'
```

## Enable EC2 recommendations

:::note
If you are an existing customer, you need to:
* Edit the IAM role used by the Harness AWS Connector corresponding to the AWS account.
* In the IAM role, add the `ce:GetRightsizingRecommendation` permission to the **HarnessEventsMonitoringPolicy**.
:::

Once you have the `ce:GetRightsizingRecommendation` permission added to the **HarnessEventsMonitoringPolicy** in the IAM role, perform the following tasks on your AWS console to enable recommendations.

1. On your AWS console, go to the **Cost Explorer** service.

  <docimage path={require('./static/ec2-recom-aws-screen-1.png')} width="50%" height="50%" title="Click to view full size image" />

2. Click **Preferences** on the left pane.
3. Enable the following recommendations:
 * Receive Amazon EC2 resource recommendations 
 * Recommendations for linked accounts
  
  <docimage path={require('./static/ec2-recom-aws-screen-2.png')} width="50%" height="50%" title="Click to view full size image" />

4. Verify that you have enabled these recommendations correctly. 

  Open AWS CloudShell and run the following command: 

```
  aws ce get-rightsizing-recommendation --service AmazonEC2
```
 
 If the recommendations are not enabled, the following error message is displayed:

     
  "An error occurred (AccessDeniedException) when calling the GetRightsizingRecommendation operation: Rightsizing EC2 recommendation is an opt-in only feature. You can enable this feature from the PAYER account’s Cost Explorer Preferences page. Normally it may take up to 24 hours in order to generate your rightsizing recommendations."

5. You must install the Amazon CloudWatch agent on your EC2 instance to enable memory metrics.
   
## Reference - AWS access permissions

CCM requires the following permissions which are automatically created via a StackSet based on the features you select during configuration.

> **☆ NOTE —** If you don't have access to create a cost and usage report or run a CloudFormation template, contact your IT or security teams to provide the required permissions.

### Cost visibility

The cost visibility policy grants the following permissions:

* List CUR reports and visibility into the organization's Structure
* Get objects from the S3 bucket configured in the CUR
* Put objects into the Harness S3 bucket
```

            "Resource": "*"  
      "Roles":  
        - "!Ref HarnessCloudFormationRole"
```

If the `cur:DescribeReportDefinitions`, `organizations:Describe`, and `organizations:List*` permissions are too wide, you can modify these to the following:


```
{  
    "Version": "2012-10-17",  
    "Statement": [  
        {  
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",  
            "Effect": "Allow",  
            "Action": [  
                "organizations:ListAccounts",  
                "organizations:ListTagsForResource"  
            ],  
            "Resource": "*"  
        }  
    ]  
}
```
* `organizations:ListAccounts`: fetches a list of all the accounts present in the organization, and also fetches the accountID to Account Name mapping.
* `organizations:ListTagsForResource`: fetches the AWS Account level tags. Harness supports account tags within CCM that can be used for reporting and analysis.

### Resource inventory management

The inventory management policy performs the following actions:

* ECS Visibility - For Granular Cluster Cost Breakdown
* EC2, EBS, RDS Visibility - Inventory Management

### Cloud asset governance rules
Enable the following permissions in AWS to execute cloud governance rules:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "ec2:Describe*",
                "ec2:DeleteSnapshot",
                "ec2:DeleteVolume",
                "ec2:Get*",
                "ec2:ListImagesInRecycleBin",
                "ec2:ListSnapshotsInRecycleBin",
                "elasticbeanstalk:Check*",
                "elasticbeanstalk:Describe*",
                "elasticbeanstalk:List*",
                "elasticbeanstalk:Request*",
                "elasticbeanstalk:Retrieve*",
                "elasticbeanstalk:Validate*",
                "elasticloadbalancing:Describe*",
                "rds:Describe*",
                "rds:List*",
                "autoscaling-plans:Describe*",
                "autoscaling-plans:GetScalingPlanResourceForecastData",
                "autoscaling:Describe*",

                "s3:Get*",
                "s3:List*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*",

        }
    ]
}
```

:::info
* This is not an exhaustive list; you may require additional permissions to support custom rules.
* A yellow underline in a custom policy indicates that you need permission to support the underlined filters and/or actions.

#### Add permissions
If you come across an error message indicating missing permissions, as displayed in the following screenshot, you need to add the missing permission [here](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home#/roles). 


<docimage path={require('./static/asset-governance-test-output-error.png')} width="50%" height="50%" title="Click to view full size image" />

1. Copy the role specified in the error message that requires permission to execute the rule.
2. Enter the role in IAM > Roles search box to filter the roles. The policies are displayed. 

  <docimage path={require('./static/aws-missing-permission-role.png')} width="50%" height="50%" title="Click to view full size image" />

3. In the list of policies, select the policy to edit.
    <docimage path={require('./static/aws-select-policy.png')} width="50%" height="50%" title="Click to view full size image" />

4. In the **Permissions** tab, select **Edit policy**, and then go to the **JSON** tab.

      <docimage path={require('./static/aws-edit-json.png')} width="50%" height="50%" title="Click to view full size image" />

5. Add the missing permissions. You can use a wildcard (asterisk) to grant multiple permissions. For example, `s3:Get*` permission would allow multiple S3 actions that start with "Get". 
6. Save changes.
