Harness CCM Budgets provide comprehensive cost governance capabilities that help you proactively manage and control your cloud spending. 

**With Budgets, you can:**

- **Set Custom [Budget Limits](#step-2-set-budget-amount)**: Define spending thresholds for specific cloud resources, services, or entire projects based on your organizational needs
- **Receive Proactive [Alerts](#optional-step-3-configure-alerts)**: Get notified when your actual costs exceed or are forecasted to exceed your predefined budget limits
- **Monitor Multiple Time Periods**: Create budgets for various timeframes including monthly, quarterly, or yearly periods
- **Track Actual vs. Forecasted Costs**: Compare real-time spending against predicted costs to make informed financial decisions
- **Organize with [Budget Groups](/docs/cloud-cost-management/use-ccm-cost-governance/ccm-budgets/create-budget-group)**: Combine multiple budgets into hierarchical groups for better organization and cascading budget management

## Prerequisites

* [Create CCM Connector](/docs/cloud-cost-management/get-started/#aws): Create a CCM connector to connect to your cloud provider.
* [Create Cost Perspectives](/docs/cloud-cost-management/use-ccm-cost-reporting/ccm-perspectives/creating-a-perspective): Budgets are created on Perspectives. If you do not have a Perspective of the resources you would like to budget, first create a new Perspective and then proceed to set a budget.

## FAQs

### What is Forecasted Cost and how is it calculated?

Harness CCM displays a *Forecasted Cost* for every budget. It estimates how much you will spend **by the end of the current period** if your current pace continues.

#### Calculation 

Average Daily Spend = `(H + C) / Dₕ`

**Forecasted Cost**
- For Daily Budget: `(H + C) / Dₕ`
- For Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly, Yearly: `C + AverageDailySpend × R`

Where:
- **H**: Sum of Actual Cost across all completed periods
- **C**: Actual spend in the current period so far (start-day → yesterday)
- **Dₕ**: Days from the first history day **through yesterday** (inclusive)
- **R**: Calendar days remaining (today → last day of period)

#### Examples:

| Budget Period | Date Range | Today | H (Historical Spend) | Dₕ (Days of History) | C (Current Spend) | R (Days Remaining) | Average Daily Spend | Forecasted Cost |
|---------------|------------|-------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------------|--------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Weekly | Mon 8 Jan – Sun 14 Jan | Wed 10 Jan | $12,000 | 86 | $350 | 5 | $143 | $1,065 |
| Monthly | 1 Jan – 31 Jan | 10 Jan | $48,000 | 101 | $8,600 | 21 | $560 | $20,360 |
| Quarterly | 1 Apr – 30 Jun | 15 May | $400,000 | 409 | $160,000 | 46 | $1,369 | $222,974 |
| Yearly | 1 Jan 2025 – 31 Dec 2025 | 1 Aug 2025 | $1,800,000 | 577 | $1,150,000 | 152 | $5,106 | $1,927,000 |
