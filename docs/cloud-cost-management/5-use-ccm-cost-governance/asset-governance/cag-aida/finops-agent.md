Harness CCM Asset Governance now comes with FinOps Agent - a smart AI agent that analyses account data to create enforcements which can then be edited, customised and applied by users as per their needs. This agent shows all the recommended enforcements and the rules associated with them in an effort to maximize cost savings.

All Enforcements generated by the Agent are marked as "Draft Enforcements" and every draft enforcement can be edited by the user to customize them according to the user's needs. The user can accept the enforcement or choose to dismiss it. After accepting the draft enforcement, it will move to enforcements list.

Here is a brief walkthrough:
