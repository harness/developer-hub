Recommendations help kickstart your journey with governance. Essentially, Harness runs certain policies behind the scenes to generate recommendations for your governance-enabled Azure subscriptions. These policies not only help to cut costs but also increase the efficiency of your system. On the Governance Overview page, Harness showcases recommendations that will benefit you to save costs on associated resources. You can click on any recommendation to view its details. 

Listed below are the custodian policies which are used to generate recommendations that Harness offers for Azure. Along with each policy, you can also find their respective descriptions, the logic behind savings computation and the permissions required to generate or apply these recommendations.

### Recommendation: delete-low-utilised-cosmodb
**Description:** Delete low utilised CosmosDB based on total requests in last 72 hours.

**Policy Used:**
```yaml
policies:
  - name: delete-low-utilised-cosmodb
    resource: azure.cosmosdb
    description: |
      Delete low utilised CosmosDB based on total requests in last 72 hours
    filters:
      - type: metric
        metric: TotalRequests
        op: le
        aggregation: total
        threshold: 1000
        timeframe: 72
    actions:
      - type: delete    
```
**Savings Computed:** The policy identifies a list of resources on which potential savings are calculated by summing up cost of each resource for last 30 days.

**Permissions Required:** To execute the action section of the custodian policy, the Contributor Role is required, whereas the Reader Role suffices for generating recommendations.

### Recommendation: delete-unattached-disk
**Description:** Delete all unattached disks.
