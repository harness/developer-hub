Asset governance policies play a crucial role in governing and optimizing costs by enforcing governance rules. However, authoring these policies can be challenging and confusing at times. In such situations, Generative AI support can be extremely valuable in assisting with policy creation. Harness AI Copilot offers a user-friendly interface and serves as an excellent starting point for establishing the necessary policies. By leveraging this tool, organizations can streamline the process of policy development and ensure that the required policies are effectively implemented.

The Harness AI Copilot offers comprehensive support with the following functionalities:

* Assists in writing rules based on specific requirements: Helps users formulate rules tailored to their specific needs. By understanding the user's requirements, it generates customized rules to align with their governance objectives.
* Provides descriptions of existing rules: Offers detailed descriptions of pre-existing rules. This feature allows users to gain a clear understanding of the purpose, scope, and implications of each rule, facilitating informed decision-making during the policy creation process.
