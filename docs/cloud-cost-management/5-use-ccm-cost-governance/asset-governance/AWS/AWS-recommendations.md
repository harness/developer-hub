Recommendations help kickstart your journey with governance. Essentially, Harness run certain policies behind the scenes to generate recommendations for your governance-enabled AWS accounts. These policies not only help to cut costs but also increase the efficiency of your system. On the Governance Overview page, Harness showcases recommendations that will benefit you to save costs on associated resources. You can click on any recommendation to view its details. 

Listed below are the custodian policies which are used to generate recommendations that Harness offers for AWS. Along with each policy, you can also find their respective descriptions, the logic behind savings computation and the permissions required to generate or apply these recommendations.

### Recommendation: s3-lifecycle-configuration

**Description:** Configure lifecycle for S3 buckets wherever it is absent which would help to reduce storage spend

**Policy Used:**

```yaml
policies:
  - name: s3-lifecycle-configuration
    resource: aws.s3
    description: |
      Configure lifecycle for s3 buckets wherever it is absent which would help to reduce storage spend
    filters:
      - type : value
        key : Lifecycle
        value : absent
    actions:
      - type: configure-lifecycle
        rules:
          - ID: harness-default-lifecycle
            Status: Enabled
            Filter:
              Prefix: ''
            Expiration:
              ExpiredObjectDeleteMarker: True
            AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload:
              DaysAfterInitiation: 7
            NoncurrentVersionExpiration:
              NoncurrentDays: 30
              NewerNoncurrentVersions: 6
```

**Savings Computed**: 
To estimate the percentage cost savings from the given S3 lifecycle policies, we need to look at the specific actions and apply some reasonable assumptions. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. Abort Incomplete Multipart Uploads after 7 days:
- Assumption: 5% of all uploads are incomplete and are not cleaned up without this policy.
- Cost Impact: Each incomplete multipart upload that is aborted saves the storage cost of the data uploaded so far.

2. Expire Noncurrent Versions after 30 days (keeping 6 versions):
- Assumption: Each object has, on average, 10 noncurrent versions stored. Expiring noncurrent versions after 30 days, keeping only the latest 6, will delete 4 out of every 10 noncurrent versions.
- Cost Impact: Deleting 40% of noncurrent versions reduces the total storage used by these versions.

**Example Calculation**

Let's assume the following for a single S3 bucket:

**Total Storage Used**: 1 TB (1,024 GB) in the S3 Standard storage class.

**Storage Distribution:**
- Current versions: 50% (512 GB)
- Noncurrent versions: 40% (410 GB)
- Incomplete multipart uploads: 10% (102 GB)

### Recommendation: s3-intelligent-tiering-configuration

**Description:** Configure intelligent tiering for S3 buckets wherever it is disabled which would help to reduce storage spend.

**Policy Used:**

```yaml
policies:
  - name: s3-intelligent-tiering-configuration
    resource: aws.s3
    description: |
      Configure intelligent tiering for s3 buckets wherever it is disabled which would help to reduce storage spend.
    filters:
      - not:
          - type: intelligent-tiering
            attrs:
              - Status: Enabled
    actions:
      - type: set-intelligent-tiering
        Id: harness-default
        IntelligentTieringConfiguration:
          Id: harness-default
          Status: Enabled
          Tierings:
            - Days: 90
              AccessTier: ARCHIVE_ACCESS
            - Days: 180
              AccessTier: DEEP_ARCHIVE_ACCESS
```

**Savings Computed:** 
- **Frequent Access Tier:** This tier is equivalent in cost to the standard S3 storage, so no savings here.
- **Infrequent Access Tier:** Data not accessed for 30 days moves here, saving approximately 45% compared to standard S3 storage​.
- **Archive Instant Access Tier:** Data not accessed for 90 days moves here, with savings of up to 68% compared to standard storage​.
- **Archive Access Tier:** If configured, data not accessed for 90 days can move here, offering around 71% savings​.
- **Deep Archive Access Tier:** Data not accessed for 180 days can be moved to this tier, providing up to 95% savings.

**Example Calculation**

Assume you have 1 TB of data stored in S3 standard storage:

 <DocImage path={require('../static/example1.png')} width="60%" height="60%" title="Click to view full size image" />

**Example Scenario**

If 20% of your data transitions to the Infrequent Access tier after 30 days, 20% moves to Archive Access after 90 days, and 10% moves to Deep Archive Access after 180 days, your costs might look like this:

 <DocImage path={require('../static/example2.png')} width="50%" height="50%" title="Click to view full size image" />

 This results in a cost savings of approximately 32.76% compared to keeping all data in standard S3 storage ($23.00 per month vs. $15.463 per month).
