Recommendations help kickstart your journey with governance. Essentially, Harness run certain policies behind the scenes to generate recommendations for your governance-enabled AWS accounts. These policies not only help to cut costs but also increase the efficiency of your system. On the Governance Overview page, Harness showcases recommendations that will benefit you to save costs on associated resources. You can click on any recommendation to view its details. 

Listed below are the custodian policies which are used to generate recommendations that Harness offers for AWS. Along with each policy, you can also find their respective descriptions, the logic behind savings computation and the permissions required to generate or apply these recommendations.
