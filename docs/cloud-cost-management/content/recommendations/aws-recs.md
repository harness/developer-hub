An effective way to reduce AWS EC2 instance costs is to **optimize VM utilization**. This involves resizing instances based on active tasks and decommissioning unused instances.

Harness CCM helps you reduce costs with Recommendations.

You can view the Recommendations for all of your AWS EC2 instances on the Recommendations page. Furthermore, to view **only** EC2 instances Recommendations, you can use the **Filter** option and select `EC2_INSTANCE` from the **Recommendation Type** dropdown list.

:::note
Before using Recommendations in your environment, ensure that you evaluate their impact thoroughly. The person reviewing the Recommendations should be able to understand the impacts identified in the Recommendations, as well as the impact on the infrastructure and business.

Using Recommendations without proper assessment could result in unexpected changes, such as issues with system performance or poor reliability.
