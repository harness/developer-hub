Harness CCM allows you to view your cloud spend data in the currency of your choice. It is easier to view reports and dashboards in your preferred currency rather than having it in different currencies and then converting them to your preferred currency. It provides more consistent, easy-to-consume, and meaningful cloud analytics across the entire business. 

CCM allows you to choose from the following list of currencies and displays the cost data in the specified currency:

  - ARS
  - AUD
  - BRL
  - CAD
  - CNY
  - EUR
  - GBP
  - INR
  - JPY
  - MXN
  - NOK
  - NZD
  - RUB
  - SGD
