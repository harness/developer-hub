### Set Up Azure Billing Export

1. Go to **Azure Portal ‚Üí Cost Management ‚Üí Exports**.
2. Click **+ Create** to create a new export.
3. Configure your export:
   - üìù **Name**: Enter a descriptive name (e.g., `ccm-harness-export`)
   - üìä **Type**: Choose **Actual cost** or **Amortized cost**
   - üïí **Frequency**: Set to **Daily**
4. Set up storage destination:
   - Choose your **Storage account** (or create new)

5. Click **Create** to complete setup.


:::info Choose your billing type
Harness supports two billing types:
- **Actual**: Reflects real-time incurred charges.
- **Amortised**: Spreads out charges (e.g., reserved instances) evenly over usage.

Choose the one that aligns best with your internal reporting strategy. This cannot be changed later.
:::

:::caution time for data delivery
It may take up to **24 hours** for Azure to begin delivering cost and usage data. You can still proceed through the wizard, but the connection test may fail if data isn‚Äôt yet available.

In the meantime, explore the optional requirements and feature integrations available in Harness CCM, these will be available to select in your **Choose Requirements** step of the connection wizard:

  - [Resource Inventory Management](/docs/cloud-cost-management/use-ccm-cost-reporting/use-ccm-dashboards/view-aws-ec-2-inventory-cost-dashboard/).
  - [Optimization by AutoStopping](/docs/cloud-cost-management/use-ccm-cost-optimization/optimize-cloud-costs-with-intelligent-cloud-auto-stopping-rules/getting-started).
  - [Cloud Governance](/docs/cloud-cost-management/use-ccm-cost-governance/asset-governance/asset-governance).

2. Provide the following required information:
   - **Name**: Enter a descriptive name for your connector
   - **Azure Tenant ID**: Find your [Azure Tenant ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-portal/get-subscription-tenant-id#find-your-microsoft-entra-tenant)
   - **Azure Subscription ID**: Find your [Azure Subscription ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-portal/get-subscription-tenant-id#find-your-azure-subscription)
   - (Optional)**Description**: Add a description for your connector

2. Enter the following:

| Required Info                       | Where to Find It                             | Why It‚Äôs Needed                                       |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Storage Account Name**            | Azure Portal ‚Üí Storage accounts              | Source location of exported billing data.             |
| **Subscription ID**                 | Azure Portal ‚Üí Subscriptions                 | Identifies the subscription being monitored.          |
| **Storage Container**               | Azure Portal ‚Üí Storage accounts ‚Üí Containers | Target location for billing export data.              |
| **Storage Directory & Export Name** | When configuring Billing Export in Azure     | Required to locate and identify billing data exports. |
4. Select your **Metric (Billing Type)**:
   * `Actual` or `Amortised`
5. Click **Continue**.



---

#### Step 3: Choose Requirements
1. **Cost Visibility** is selected by default.
2. (Optional) You can enable any of the following features (they can also be added later):
   - Resource Inventory Management
   - Optimization by AutoStopping. If selected, you can select granular permissions for AutoStopping by clicking **Continue**
   - Cloud Governance
3. Click **Continue**.

---

#### Step 4: Create Service Principal

Harness uses a multi-tenant application to securely access your billing data and enable the features you selected.

1. The wizard displays customized Azure CLI commands based on your feature selections from **Step 3: Choose Requirements**.
2. Copy and execute these commands in **Azure Cloud Shell** or your local terminal with Azure CLI.
3. After successful execution, click **Continue**.

:::tip
The displayed commands are dependent on your specific feature selections. Always use the commands shown in your wizard interface.
:::

:::info
Review [Feature Permissions](/docs/cloud-cost-management/feature-permissions) for CCM to understand the minimum roles or permissions needed for every CCM feature.
:::
---

#### Step 5: Verify the Connection
1. Harness will attempt to validate the connection using your inputs.
2. If this step fails, it's usually because Azure has not yet delivered the first billing export.
   - Wait up to **24 hours** after setting up the billing export before trying again.
3. Once validated, click **Finish Setup**.

üéâ You‚Äôve now connected your Azure account and enabled cost visibility in Harness.

## Next Steps
Once your Azure billing data is flowing into Harness, explore these features to enhance your cloud cost management:

- [View and Create Perspectives](https://developer.harness.io/docs/cloud-cost-management/use-ccm-cost-reporting/ccm-perspectives/creating-a-perspective) to visualize cloud usage and trends.
- Create [Budgets and Alerts](/docs/cloud-cost-management/use-ccm-cost-governance/ccm-budgets/create-a-budget) to monitor spend thresholds.
- Use [BI Dashboards](/docs/cloud-cost-management/use-ccm-cost-reporting/use-ccm-dashboards/access-ccm-dashboards) to visualize cloud usage and trends.
- Revisit optional integrations:
  - [Resource Inventory Management](/docs/cloud-cost-management/use-ccm-cost-reporting/use-ccm-dashboards/azure-cost-dashboard/).
  - [Optimization by AutoStopping](/docs/cloud-cost-management/use-ccm-cost-optimization/optimize-cloud-costs-with-intelligent-cloud-auto-stopping-rules/getting-started).
