Harness offers two primary licensing tiers for Cloud Cost Management: **Free Forever** and **Enterprise**. 

:::info
- **If Your Cloud Spend Exceeds $250K/year**: You must upgrade to an Enterprise plan. The Free Forever plan is limited to organizations with less than USD250K/month in cloud spend.

- **If Your Cloud Spend is Under $250K/year**: CCM remains accessible on the Free Forever plan, but with certain limitations and adjustments. 

:::

## Free Forever

The Free Forever plan is a no-commitment, no-contract plan that provides you with the essential features of CCM for free. It is ideal for small and medium-sized organizations with less than USD250K/month in cloud spend.

| Feature | Free Forever | 
|---------|-------------|
| **Cloud Spend Manage** | Up to $250,000/year | 
| **Kubernetes Clusters** | 2 | 
| **[AutoStopping Rules](https://developer.harness.io/docs/category/autostopping-rules)** | 10 rules |
| **Data Visibility** | Data available for viewing limited to 30 days | 
| **Currency Preferences** | Not supported | 

#### Definitions

- **Cloud Spend Manage**: The total monthly cloud expenditure across all connected cloud accounts (AWS, Azure, GCP).
- **Kubernetes Clusters**: Number of Kubernetes clusters you can connect for cost visibility and optimization.
- **AutoStopping Rules**: Intelligent rules that automatically stop idle cloud resources to reduce costs.
- **Data Visibility**: The timeframe for which historical cost data and analytics are accessible to users in the dashboard and reports.
- **Currency Preferences**: Ability to view and report costs in currencies other than USD.


## Enterprise Plan

Harness has introduced a new pricing model for Cloud Cost Management that gives you the flexibility to choose exactly what you need. Our CCM suite is now available as four separate SKUs that can be purchased individually or bundled together.

You can buy SKUs individually or buy the entire CCM bundle.

The individual SKUs available are:
