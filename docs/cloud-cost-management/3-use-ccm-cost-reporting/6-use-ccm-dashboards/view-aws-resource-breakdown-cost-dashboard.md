# View AWS Resource Breakdown Dashboard

Harness provides preloaded **By Harness** (pre-defined) and **Custom** (user-defined) Dashboards to visualize cloud cost data across clusters and cloud accounts. Using the **AWS Resource Breakdown Dashboard** you can:

* Discover new analytical insights into your AWS Services
* Track various cloud cost indicators across different zones and time range
* View instance metrics
* Explore the cloud cost data in a logical and structured manner
* View your cloud costs at a glance, understand what is costing the most, and analyze cost trends

This Dashboard will not be available if you have not selected **AWS** **Resource Breakdown Dashboard** feature when setting up [CCM for AWS](../../get-started/onboarding-guide/set-up-cost-visibility-for-aws.md). This topic describes how to view the **By Harness AWS Resource Breakdown Dashboard** and get more information about that data.

## Prerequisites
