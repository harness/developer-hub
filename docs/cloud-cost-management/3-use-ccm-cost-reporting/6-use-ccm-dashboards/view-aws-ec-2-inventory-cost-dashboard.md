Harness provides preloaded **By Harness** (pre-defined) and **Custom** (user-defined) Dashboards to visualize cloud cost data across clusters and cloud accounts. Using the **AWS EC2 Inventory Cost Dashboard** you can:

* Discover new analytical insights into your AWS EC2 instances
* Track various cloud cost indicators across different zones and time range
* View instance metrics
* Explore the cloud cost data in a logical and structured manner
* View your cloud costs at a glance, understand what is costing the most, and analyze cost trends

This Dashboard will not be available if you have not selected **AWS ECS and Resource Inventory Management** feature when setting up [CCM for AWS](../../2-getting-started-ccm/4-set-up-cloud-cost-management/set-up-cost-visibility-for-aws.md). This topic describes how to view the **By Harness AWS EC2 Inventory Cost Dashboard** and get more information about that data.

## Prerequisites

* Ensure that you have **Dashboard-All View** permissions assigned. See [Manage Access Control for CCM Dashboards](../../2-getting-started-ccm/5-access-control/manage-access-control-for-ccm-dashboards.md).
* Ensure that you have set up Cloud Cost Management (CCM) for the [AWS](../../2-getting-started-ccm/4-set-up-cloud-cost-management/set-up-cost-visibility-for-aws.md) cloud provider.
* Ensure that you have selected **AWS ECS and Resource Inventory Management** feature when creating the AWS connector.
