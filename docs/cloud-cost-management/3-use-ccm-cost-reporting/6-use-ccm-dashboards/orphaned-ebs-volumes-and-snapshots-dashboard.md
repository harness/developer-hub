Harness provides preloaded **By Harness** (pre-defined) and **Custom** (user-defined) Dashboards to visualize cloud cost data across clusters and cloud accounts. Using the **Orphaned EBS Volumes and Snapshots** **Dashboard** you can:

* Discover new analytical insights into your EBS volumes and snapshots
* Explore the cloud cost data in a logical and structured manner
* View your cloud costs at a glance, understand what is costing the most, and analyze cost trends

This Dashboard will not be available if you have not selected **AWS ECS and Resource Inventory Management** feature when setting up [CCM for AWS](../../get-started/onboarding-guide/set-up-cost-visibility-for-aws.md).This topic describes how to view the **Orphaned EBS Volumes and Snapshots** **Dashboard** and get more information about that data.

## Prerequisites

* Ensure that you have **Dashboard-All View** permissions assigned. See [Manage Access Control for CCM Dashboards](/docs/cloud-cost-management/access-control/manage-access-control-for-ccm-dashboards.md).
* Ensure that you have set up Cloud Cost Management (CCM) for the [AWS](../../get-started/onboarding-guide/set-up-cost-visibility-for-aws.md) cloud provider.
* Ensure that you have selected **AWS ECS and Resource Inventory Management** feature when creating the AWS connector. 
  
## Data Ingestion for Dashboard

Once you have set up cost visibility for the [AWS](../../get-started/onboarding-guide/set-up-cost-visibility-for-aws.md) cloud provider and the data is available for root cost analysis, you can view the dashboard. The data in the Dashboard is updated dynamically.

## View Orphaned EBS Volumes and Snapshots Dashboard

Perform the following steps to view Orphaned EBS Volumes and Snapshots Dashboard:

1. In Harness, click **Dashboards**.
2. Click **Orphaned EBS Volumes and Snapshots Dashboard**.
3. In **EBS Volume Creation Date**, select the date. You can add multiple OR conditions.

5. In **Snapshot Creation Date**, select the date. You can add multiple OR conditions.
6. Once you have selected all the filters, click **Update**.  
  
The **Orphaned EBS Volumes and Snapshots Dashboard** is displayed.
