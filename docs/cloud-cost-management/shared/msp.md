# Margin obfuscation for managed service providers (MSP)
:::note
Currently, this feature is behind the feature flag **CCM_MSP**. Contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io) to enable the feature. 
:::

Each managed service provider (MSP) works with multiple end customers who have Harness CCM customer accounts. The MSP has pre-negotiated discounted costs with each cloud service provider (CSP), which are reflected in the AWS CUR and Azure/GCP billing exports. Harness CCM retrieves these discounted costs from the billing exports.

In addition to the pre-negotiated discounted costs paid to each CSP, the MSP adds a margin that can vary based on the customer, CSP, and service. The MSP enters this margin per service to be added on top of the costs.

Harness CCM incorporates the pre-negotiated discounted costs per CSP and the additional margin per customer and service. As a result, end customers can view the cost per service per CSP as the MSP's negotiated cost plus the MSP margin.

## Prerequisites

1. Set up CCM for your CSP. Go to the following topics for more information: 

* [Set up CCM for AWS](../2-getting-started-ccm/4-set-up-cloud-cost-management/set-up-cost-visibility-for-aws.md)
* [Set up CCM for GCP](../2-getting-started-ccm/4-set-up-cloud-cost-management/set-up-cost-visibility-for-gcp.md)
* [Set up CCM for Azure](../2-getting-started-ccm/4-set-up-cloud-cost-management/set-up-cost-visibility-for-azure.md)
* [Set up CCM for Kubernetes clusters](../2-getting-started-ccm/4-set-up-cloud-cost-management/set-up-cost-visibility-for-kubernetes.md)

2. Add customers to the Harness CCM account. Create [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io) tickets to add customers.


:::note
In its initial release, **Margin Obfuscation** is supported only on AWS.
