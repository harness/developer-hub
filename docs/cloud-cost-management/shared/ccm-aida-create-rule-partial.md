  * Type your requirement and select the **Return** key. Alternatively, you can directly enter your governance requirement into the UI. Type your desired rule in a clear and concise manner and select the **Return** key. For example, you could specify a rule such as "Delete EC2 instances older than 90 days." Harness AIDA processes your input and generates a corresponding rule.
