- SMP

### Notes

- Maximum limits

  - Cost Buckets: 1000
  - Shared Buckets: 10

- Dashboard limitations

  - Any changes to the cost categories will only be reflective for the current month data onwards. Historical data will point to the state of cost categories at that point in time.  
  - Cost category metadata attribution doesn’t work for any historical data, it is only from the point of cost category creation. 
  - Not supported in dashboards for cluster, AWS, GCP & Azure models. Only supported in the **Unified** Model. 
  - Shared cost data attribution of cost categories doesn’t flow into dashboards.

- Perspectives limitations
  - Perspectives always rely on the current state of cost categories, everything is generated dynamically real-time.
  - Sharing of unallocated costs among cost buckets is not supported

<summary>Currency Standardization</summary>


### Feature summary
Currency standardization allows you to view your cloud spend data in the currency of your choice. It provides more consistent, easy-to-consume, and meaningful cloud analytics across the entire business.

### Benefits
If you have cloud provider bills in different currencies, currency standardization helps you normalize all costs into a single currency of your choice. 

### Supported Platforms
- SaaS

### Notes

- After standardizing the currency, historical cluster data is not backfilled automatically. Today a support request has to be raised to replay/backfill data.
- You can configure your preferred currency only once. It can't be updated later.
- The currency symbol in dashboards don't change, but the cost values are displayed in the preferred currency.
- Only 15 currencies are supported
- Default currency conversion factor is picked up from the CUR and falls back to public API. 
- Option to change currency conversion factor. The new factor will be used to:

  - Reflect current month’s data and new data for cloud
  - Reflect current day’s data and new data for cluster
- Currency representation based on locale. Default is `en-us` locale.
- After configuring it may take up to 24 hours for the converted value to be displayed.

<summary>Recommendations</summary>


### Feature summary
CCM provides recommendations for your ECS clusters, workloads, node pools, Azure VMs, and AWS EC2 instances. Recommendations are also generated for asset governance policies. These recommendations show you resource optimization opportunities to potentially reduce your monthly spending.

The recommendations are computed by analyzing the past utilization of CPU and memory of your workload. The implementation uses a histogram method to compute the recommendations.

### Benefits
* **Cost optimisation**: With recommendations you can get an overview of the potential cost savings on resources across your infrastructure.
  
* **Automated workflow**: Automatically generated recommendations based on your past utilization data and trends.

* **Ticketing integration**: Allows you to easily manage all the recommendations and facilitates comprehensive tracking of recommendation lifecycles across the system. CCM offers Jira and ServiceNow as the ticketing tools to manage all the recommendations within CCM. You are also provided with an option to ignore the recommendation if it is not applicable. 

### Prerequisites
- Kubernetes connectors are required for workload and node pool recommendations 
- AWS, Azure connectors with inventory management enabled. 

### Supported use cases
- AWS EC2 
- Azure VMs 
- K8s Cluster

### CCM on air-gapped environment

CCM is supported in [Harness Self-Managed Enterprise Edition installs on an air-gapped environment](/docs/self-managed-enterprise-edition/self-managed-helm-based-install/install-in-an-air-gapped-environment/).

CCM leverages AWS APIs that require connectivity from the isolated (air-gapped) instance. To grant access to these AWS APIs, establish VPC endpoints for the respective AWS services. For services lacking VPC endpoints, use a proxy to facilitate access. For more information, go to [Manage AWS costs by using CCM on Harness Self-Managed Enterprise Edition](../get-started/ccm-smp/aws-smp.md).

For a comprehensive list of supported features in other Harness modules and the Harness Platform overall, go to [Supported platforms and technologies](/docs/get-started/supported-platforms-and-technologies.md).
