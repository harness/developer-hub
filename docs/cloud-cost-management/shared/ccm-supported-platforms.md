### CCM on Air-Gapped Environment
CCM is supported in [Harness Self-Managed Enterprise Edition installs on an air-gapped environment](/docs/self-managed-enterprise-edition/install/install-in-an-air-gapped-environment).

CCM leverages AWS APIs that require connectivity from the isolated (air-gapped) instance. To grant access to these AWS APIs, establish VPC endpoints for the respective AWS services. For services lacking VPC endpoints, use a proxy to facilitate access. For more information, go to [Manage AWS costs by using CCM on Harness Self-Managed Enterprise Edition](../get-started/ccm-smp/aws-smp.md).

For a comprehensive list of supported features in other Harness modules and the Harness Platform overall, go to [Supported platforms and technologies](/docs/platform/platform-whats-supported).
