This topic describes how to view the Deployments (FirstGen) Dashboard and get more information about that data.

:::note

Currently, this feature is behind the Feature Flags `TIME_SCALE_CG_SYNC` and `CUSTOM_DASHBOARD_V2`. Contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io) to enable the feature.

:::

The **FirstGen** custom dashboards in Harness NextGen display information for your [Harness FirstGen deployments](/docs/continuous-delivery/get-started/upgrading/upgrade-nextgen-cd.md).

Dashboards help you model and analyze business metrics and operational data. You can use this data to make data-driven business decisions. Using charts, data tables, and filters, Dashboards help you get the most useful deployments data.

Harness provides pre-loaded **By Harness** (pre-defined) and **Custom** (user-defined) Dashboards to visualize deployments data across your Applications, Services, and Environment. Using the **Deployments (FirstGen) Dashboard** you can:

* Discover new analytical insights into your deployment frequency by Application and Pipeline
* Track deployment status across different zones and time range in a logical and structured manner
* View your deployments at a glance, understand the applications with the highest failure rate, analyze deployment status, etc.

## Example: Deployments and Services Dashboard

Here's an example that explains how you can create your own Dashboard to view your Deployment and Services data.

1. In Harness, click **Dashboards**.
2. In **Dashboards**, click **+ Dashboard**.

   ![](../cd-dashboards/static/view-deployments-current-gen-dashboard-43.png)

3. In **About the Dashboard**, in **Folder**, select **Organization Shared Folder**.
4. In **Name**, enter a name for your dashboard. For example, Deployments\_test.
5. (Optional) In **Tags**, type a name for your tag and press enter to create a tag, and click **Continue**.
6. Click **Edit Dashboard**.
   
   ![](../cd-dashboards/static/view-deployments-current-gen-dashboard-45.png)

7. Click **Add Tile**.
   
   ![](../cd-dashboards/static/view-deployments-current-gen-dashboard-46.png)

8. Select an Explore to get started. An Explore is a starting point for a query, designed to explore a particular subject area. The data shown in an Explore is determined by the dimensionsand measures you select from the field picker.
	* **Dimension**: A dimension can be thought of as a group or bucket of data.
	* **Measure**: A measure is information aboutthat bucket of data.
  
  ![](../cd-dashboards/static/view-deployments-current-gen-dashboard-48.png)

1.  Click the Explore that corresponds to the fields you want to include in your dashboard. For example, Deployments and Services.
2.  Enter a name for your tile. This will be the name of the tile on the dashboard.
   
   ![](../cd-dashboards/static/view-deployments-current-gen-dashboard-49.png)

3.  Select the dimensions and measures for your query. In this example, the following filters are used to aggregate data for the last 7 days:  

	* **Deployments**: Pipeline Name, Failed Deployments, and Total Deployments
	* **Services**: Failed Service Deployments, Successful Service Deployments, and Total Service Deployments
4.  Configure your visualization options. For more information, see [Create Visualizations and Graphs](../../platform/dashboards/create-visualizations-and-graphs.md).
5.  Once you have set up your query, click **Run**.
   
   ![](../cd-dashboards/static/view-deployments-current-gen-dashboard-50.png)

6.  Click **Save** to save the query as a tile on your dashboard.
7.  You can add multiple tiles to your Dashboard. For example, add a tile for total and failed Service Deployments in the last 7 days.
   
   ![](../cd-dashboards/static/view-deployments-current-gen-dashboard-51.png)

8.  Once you have set up your query, click **Run** and then click **Save**. All the tiles are added to your Dashboard.
