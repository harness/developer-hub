This topic provides settings and permissions for the CD **Canary Deployment** step.

## Review: What Workloads Can I Deploy?

See [What Can I Deploy in Kubernetes?](what-can-i-deploy-in-kubernetes.md)

## Canary Deployment

In this step, you will define how many pods are deployed for a Canary test of the configuration files in your Service Definition **Manifests** section.

See [Create a Kubernetes Canary Deployment](../../cd-execution/kubernetes-executions/create-a-kubernetes-canary-deployment.md).

## YAML

```YAML
              - step:
                  type: K8sCanaryDeploy
                  name: Canary Deploy
                  identifier: Canary_Deploy
                  spec:
                    skipDryRun: false
                    instanceSelection:
                      type: Count
                      spec:
                        count: 1
                  timeout: 10m
```




## Name

Enter the name for the step.

## Instances

In **Instances**, select **Instance Count** or **Percentage**.

In **Instances**, enter the number of pods to deploy.

If you selected **Instance Count**, enter the number of pods.

If you selected **Percentage**, enter a percentage of the pods defined in your Service Definition **Manifests** files to deploy.

For example, in you have `replicas: 4` in a manifest in Service, and you enter **50** in **Instances**, then 2 pods are deployed in this Phase step.

## Timeout

How long Harness should run this step before failing it. Enter a minimum of 10m to account for network activity in your target environment.

## Skip Dry Run

By default, Harness uses the `--dry-run` flag on the `kubectl apply` command during the **Initialize** step of this command, which prints the object that would be sent to the cluster without really sending it.

If the **Skip Dry Run** option is selected, Harness will not use the `--dry-run` flag.
