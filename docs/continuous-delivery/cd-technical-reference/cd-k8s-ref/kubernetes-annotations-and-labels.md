This topic describes how to use annotations and labels to select objects you defined in your manifests.

## Annotations

To see annotations in action, see [Deploy Manifests Separately using Apply Step](../../cd-execution/kubernetes-executions/deploy-manifests-using-apply-step.md) and [Ignore a Manifest File During Deployment](../../cd-advanced/cd-kubernetes-category/ignore-a-manifest-file-during-deployment.md).Annotations are a way to pass additional metadata for resources to Harness. For a description of Annotations, see [Annotations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/) from Kubernetes.

The following Annotations can be put on resource specifications in the Harness Service **Manifests** section.



| **Annotation** | **Value** | **Usage** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `harness.io/skip-versioning` | `"true"|"false"` | By default, all the ConfigMap and [Secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/) resources are versioned by Harness. Corresponding references in PodSpec are also updated with versions.Set to `true` to exclude versioning of a resource (for example ConfigMap or Secret). |
| `harness.io/direct-apply` | `"true"|"false"` | Set to `true` to make a manifest an unmanaged workload.A **managed** workload in Harness is a workload taken to steady state and verified at steady state. If it fails to reach steady state, rollback occurs.An **unmanaged** workload is simply run without checking for steady state.For example, a Canary Deployment requires a minimum of 1 Deployment or StatefulSet as a managed workload. You can deploy additional workloads in the deployment by using the `harness.io/direct-apply: true` for the additional workload manifest.See [What Can I Deploy in Kubernetes?](what-can-i-deploy-in-kubernetes.md). |
| `harness.io/primary-service` | `"true"|"false"` | Identifies the primary Kubernetes service in a Blue/Green deployment. |
| `harness.io/stage-service` | `"true"|"false"` | Identifies the Kubernetes stage service in a Blue/Green deployment. |

## Labels

The following labels are applied by Harness during deployment.


| **Label** | **Value** | **Usage** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `harness.io/release-name` | `release name` | Applied on pods. Harness uses a release name for tracking releases, rollback, etc. You can supply a release name in an Environment's Infrastructure Definition **Release Name** field. |
| `harness.io/track` | `canary` \| `stable` | Applied on pods in a Canary deployment. |
| `harness.io/color` | `blue` \| `green` | Applied on pods in a Blue/Green deployment. |
