DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) metrics is a standard measure of DevOps performance. By understanding these metrics, you can make informed decisions and implement improvements that can help your business grow.

## Use tags to revert a failed pipeline execution

When you create a new pipeline stage, add the following tag with runtime input, `<+input>` to the pipeline YAML.

```
tags:
  revert_execution_id: <+input>
```
:::note
Harness UI doesn't support runtime inputs, `<+input>` for tags. Select the YAML view to add runtime inputs to tags. 
:::

Currently, Harness does not measure regressions or failures that occur after a production deployment is complete. 
 
During the pipeline deployment, if there is a downtime, the `revertPipeline` execution restores the service. This allows you to mark a pipeline execution as a restored pipeline and link it to the pipeline execution that introduced the issue.

Below is an example `Inputs.yaml` of a pipeline execution. The `revert_execution_id` tag represents the execution ID of the pipeline that caused the issue.

```
pipeline:
  identifier: "DOra_pipeline"
  tags:
    revert_execution_id: "Q0bizp0QTM6xtB1FZsR0zQ"
  stages:
  - stage:
      identifier: "stage1"
      type: "Deployment"
      spec:
        service:
          serviceRef: "Ser2"
        environment:
          environmentRef: "Env2"
          infrastructureDefinitions:
          - identifier: "Infra_2"
```

## Create queries to pull data into your DORA dashboard

After you [create a DORA metrics dashboard](../../platform/18_Dashboards/create-dashboards.md), you can [add tiles](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/dashboards/create-dashboards/#step-2-add-tiles-to-a-dashboard) to the dashboard. 

You can edit, delete, resize, move postions, or download data of the tiles. 

Using the DORA metrics dashboard, you can view the following metrics.

* **Deployments Frequency** tells you how many deployments happened in a particular duration. This metric helps measure the consistency of software delivery and delivery performance. 
* **Mean Time to Restore (MTTR)** tells you the time taken to restore an issue found in the production environment.  
* **Change Failure Rate** is the percentage of failure rate across all services in a given time period.

To gain deeper insights, you can create queries in the dashboard to capture data. Harness captures metrics for each service-environment combination within a pipeline. If you have a multi-service pipeline, metrics for each service-environment combination will be captured and reported separately.

### Deployment frequency

1. Enter a name your query. For example, Deployment Frequency. 
2. Select the following filters.
    * In **Deployments**, select **Custom Aggregation Period**, then select the time period.
    * In **Deployments**, select **Total Deployments**.
3. Configure your visualisation options. For more information, go to [create visualisation and graphs](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/Dashboards/create-visualizations-and-graphs).
4. Select **Run**.
5. Select **Save** to save the query as a tile on your dashboard.

### Mean time to restore

1. Enter a name your query. For example, Mean Time to Restore. 
2. Select the following filters.
    * In **Deployments**, select **Custom Aggregation Period**, then select the time period.
    * In **Reverted Deployments**, select **Mean Time to Restore**.
3. Configure your visualisation options. For more information, go to [create visualisation and graphs](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/Dashboards/create-visualizations-and-graphs).
4. Select **Run**.
5. Select **Save** to save the query as a tile on your dashboard.

### Change failure rate

1. Enter a name your query. For example, Change Failure Rate. 
2. Select the following filters.
    * In **Deployments**, select **Custom Aggregation Period**, then select the time period.
    * In **Deployments**, select **Change Failure Rate**.
3. Configure your visualisation options. For more information, go to [create visualisation and graphs](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/Dashboards/create-visualizations-and-graphs).
4. Select **Run**.
5. Select **Save** to save the query as a tile on your dashboard.
