For details on what you can deploy, go to [What Can I Deploy in Kubernetes?](/docs/continuous-delivery/deploy-srv-diff-platforms/kubernetes/cd-k8s-ref/what-can-i-deploy-in-kubernetes).

### Kubernetes version support

The following versions are tested and supported for Kubernetes Canary, Rolling, and Blue/Green deployments:

- 1.13.0
- 1.14.0
- 1.15.0
- 1.16.0
- 1.17.0
- 1.18.0
- 1.19.4
- 1.20.0
- 1.21.0
- 1.22.0
- 1.23.0
- 1.24.3
- 1.24.9
- 1.25.6

For details on other tools and versions included in Harness, see [Delegate-required SDKs](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/delegates/delegate-reference/delegate-required-sdks).

Guidelines:

- Harness will officially support 3 previous versions from the last stable release. For example, the current most recent stable release is 1.25.6, and so Harness supports 1.24, 1.23, and 1.22.
- Harness supports any other versions of Kubernetes you are using on a best effort basis.
- Harness commits to support new minor versions within 3 months of the first stable release. For example, if the stable release of 1.25.6 occurs on April 15th, we will support it for compatibility by July 15th.

### Helm notes

Helm chart dependencies are not supported in Git source repositories. Helm chart dependencies are supported in Helm Chart Repositories.

### Azure AKS clusters

To use an AKS cluster for deployment, the AKS cluster parameter `disableLocalAccounts` can be set either `true` or `false`.

<summary>Builds in CD</summary>

Continuous Integration (CI) can be performed in Harness using the module and [CI pipelines](/docs/continuous-integration/ci-quickstarts/ci-pipeline-basics).

If you are using Harness Continuous Delivery (CD) but not Harness Continuous Integration (CI), you can still perform CI using the Jenkins step in your CD stage.

Harness integrates with [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/), enabling you to run Jenkins jobs and dynamically capture inputs and outputs from the jobs.

  - HTTP Helm repos.
- Target clusters:
  - Kubernetes clusters hosted on any platform:
    - GKE.
    - AKS.

Harness supports the following infrastructure provisioning tools:

- [Terraform](/docs/continuous-delivery/cd-infrastructure/terraform-infra/terraform-provisioning-with-harness)
- [Terragrunt](/docs/continuous-delivery/cd-infrastructure/terragrunt-howtos)
- Azure ARM and Blueprint
- [AWS CloudFormation](/docs/continuous-delivery/cd-infrastructure/cloudformation-infra/cloud-formation-how-tos)
- Shell script (custom)

### Terraform version support

Harness does not include Terraform on the Harness Delegate. You must install Terraform on the Delegate when using Terraform in Harness. For more information, go to [Terraform How-tos](/docs/continuous-delivery/cd-infrastructure/terragrunt-howtos).

Harness supports the following Terraform versions:

- v1.3.5
- v1.1.9
- v1.0.0
- v0.15.5
- v0.15.0
- v0.14.0

Here's an example install script for the Harness delegate:

```bash
# Install TF
microdnf install unzip
curl -O -L https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/1.3.5/terraform_1.3.5_darwin_amd64.zip
unzip terraform_1.3.5_darwin_amd64.zip
mv ./terraform /usr/bin/
# Check TF install
terraform --version
```

Some Harness features might require specific Terraform versions.

Harness uses **Metadata only** when downloading artifact sources.

For pulling Docker images from Docker repos, Harness is restricted by the limits of the Docker repo. For example, [Docker Hub limits](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/download-rate-limit/).

The maximum number of artifact image tags fetched by Harness that is 10000.

The following table lists Harness integrations and their artifact source support:

You can use the following ticketing systems for creating and updating tickets, and as approval gates:
- Jira ([ticketing](/docs/continuous-delivery/x-platform-cd-features/cd-steps/ticketing-systems/create-jira-issues-in-cd-stages), [approvals](/docs/platform/Approvals/adding-jira-approval-stages))
- ServiceNow ([ticketing](/docs/continuous-delivery/x-platform-cd-features/cd-steps/ticketing-systems/create-service-now-tickets-in-cd-stages), [approvals](/docs/platform/Approvals/service-now-approvals))

Harness Policy As Code uses [Open Policy Agent (OPA)](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/) as the central service to store and enforce policies for the different entities and processes across the Harness platform.

You can centrally define and store policies and then select where (which entities) and when (which events) they will be applied.

Currently, you can define and store policies directly in the OPA service in Harness.

Soon, you will be able to use remote Git or other repos (e.g. OCI-compatible registries) to define and store the policies used in Harness.
