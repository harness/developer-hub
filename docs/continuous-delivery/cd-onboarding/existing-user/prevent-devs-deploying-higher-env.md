title: Prevent devs from deploying to higher level environments
description: Control the environments where devs can deploy.
sidebar_position: 1

There are scenarios where you want to control which environments devs can access for deployments:

- Harness administrators do not want application teams to deploy to higher level environments.
- A team uses one pipeline to deploy to multiple environments because it keeps their configuration dry and reusable. They want the way they deploy to production to be similar to their lower environments.

There are a couple solutions you can use to support these scenarios.

## Resource groups and roles

Resource Groups and RBAC manage who has access to Harness resources. You can configure a resource group that only grants access to specific environments. This means that the role configured with that resource group will only have permissions to access that particular resource.

You can navigate to a resource groups and specify what actual resources a user has access to.

You can select resources by **Type** or **Specified**.

**Specified** lets you pick the specific environments users have access to.

**Type** lets you pick the environment type.

In **Roles Configuration**, you can configure the specific permissions for a user in the environments you selected.

The options are:
- **View**: Users can see the environment in the Harness UI.
- **Create/Edit**: Users can create new environments and edit existing environments.
- **Delete**: Users can delete the environment.
- **Access**: Users can select the environment for deployment at runtime.

If you have a pipeline that has its service and environments templated, you can now enforce what environment parameters the user has access to at runtime.

## Separate pipelines and resource groups via RBAC

Using the Resource Group construct, you can specify the pipelines you want to grant developers access to.

In **Roles**, you can configure **execute** for the the pipeline resource.

**Execute** grants permissions to run the pipeline.

The pipeline design is now impacted because you are forcing the pipeline environment as fixed. In this example, devs can only access the pipeline that deploys to **dev**.

At pipeline runtime, devs only need to select a service.
