Harness CD & GitOps is purpose built to automate deployment of your software artifacts, usually generated as output of a Continuous Integration (CI) process, to a target deployment infrastructure. This artifact can be a container image or a serverless function or  a traditional monolithic application or a custom format specific to your company. Similarly, the deployment infrastructure can be a Kubernetes cluster, serverless function providers such as AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions or even Virtual Machines running on AWS, Google Cloud, Azure or Physical Data Center. 

## Prerequisite: Complete Harness Platform onboarding

You should review and complete the following prerequisites.

- [Harness Platform onboarding guide](/docs/platform/get-started/onboarding-guide)
- [Harness Platform key concepts](/docs/platform/get-started/key-concepts)

## Step 1. Review key CD concepts & supported integrations

- [Harness CD & GitOps key concepts](/docs/continuous-delivery/get-started/key-concepts)
- [Supported integrations](/docs/continuous-delivery/cd-integrations)

## Step 2. Create your first CD pipeline 
We recommend you use either the [Harness UI](/docs/get-started/harness-ui-overview) or the [Harness CLI](/docs/category/cli) for learning how to create pipelines as well as for creating your first pipeline. Additionally, you should use a Harness-provided sample app here so that you can see how the basic features work. The tutorials below are all based on a sample app. You will onboard your own app in the next step.

- [All CD & GitOps tutorials](/tutorials/cd-pipelines)
- [Kubernetes pipelines & GitOps workflows](/tutorials/cd-pipelines/kubernetes/)
- [Serverless pipelines](/tutorials/cd-pipelines/serverless/)
- [VM pipelines for traditional apps](/tutorials/cd-pipelines/vm/)
- [Amazon ECS pipelines](/tutorials/cd-pipelines/amazon-ecs)
- [Automate pipeline execution through pipeline triggers](/tutorials/cd-pipelines/trigger)

## Step 3. See advanced CD concepts in action
Now you are ready to learn advanced CD concepts through the following tutorials.

- [Templates](/tutorials/cd-pipelines/templates)
- [Notifications](/tutorials/cd-pipelines/notifications)
- [Approvals](/tutorials/cd-pipelines/approvals)
- [Continuous Verification](/tutorials/cd-pipelines/continuous-verification/)
- [Infrastructure Provisioning as part of CD pipeline](/tutorials/cd-pipelines/infra-provisioning/)
- [Variables & Expressions](/docs/platform/Variables-and-Expressions/harness-variables)

## Step 4. Automate onboarding for your own app 
We recommend you either use Git Experience, Harness Terraform Provider or the Harness REST API for this step.

- [Git Experience](/docs/platform/Git-Experience/git-experience-overview)
- [Terraform Provider](/docs/platform/automation/terraform/harness-terraform-provider-overview)
- [API](/docs/platform/automation/api/api-quickstart)

## Step 5. Add governance guardrails 

- [Policy-as-Code](/docs/platform/governance/Policy-as-code/harness-governance-overview)

## Step 6. Become a Harness Certified Expert

### Developer Certification
This [certification](/certifications/continuous-delivery?lvl=developer) is the starting point for evaluating your understanding of Harness CD & GitOps concepts. 

### Administrator Certification
After completing the Developer Certification, you are now ready to test your skills as a Harness CD & GitOps Administrator through the [Administrator certification](/certifications/continuous-delivery?lvl=administrator).

### Architect Certification
After completing the Administrator Certification, you are now ready to test your skills as a Harness CD & GitOps Architect through the [Architect certification](/certifications/continuous-delivery?lvl=architect).
