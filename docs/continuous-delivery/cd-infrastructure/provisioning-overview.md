Harness provisioning is categorized into the following use cases:
- **Ad hoc provisioning**: temporary and on-demand provisioning of resources for specific tasks or purposes.
- **Dynamic infrastructure provisioning**: provision the target deployment environment as part of the same deployment process. Typically, dynamic infrastructure provisioning is for temporary pre-production environments, such as dev, test, and qa. Production environments are usually pre-existing.

## Important notes

- **Dynamic infrastructure provisioning**: 
  - Only provisioners that produce outputs can be used in an **Infrastructure Definition** to dynamically provision deployment target infrastructure.
  - Currently, dynamic provisioning of target infrastructure is not supported for the AWS ASG, AWS SAM, and SpotInst deployment types.
  - Dynamic provisioning is not supported when [using multiple services and environments](/docs/continuous-delivery/x-platform-cd-features/advanced/multiserv-multienv) in a pipeline stage.

## Ad hoc provisioning

To perform ad hoc provisioning in your Harness Deploy stage, you use provisioning steps as part of the stage **Execution** section.

For example, in the following figure, Harness Terraform Plan and Apply steps are used to provision the required AWS IAM resources, which are independent of the rolling deployment to the Kubernetes cluster itself.

## Dynamic infrastructure provisioning

Dynamic infrastructure provisioning creates your target infrastructure dynamically during the execution of your pipeline.

To perform dynamic provisioning in your Harness Deploy stage, you add provisioning steps to the stage **Environment** settings. Then you map specific provisioner script/template outputs to the target infrastructure in the same stage **Environment** section. 

For example, the name of the target Kubernetes cluster namespace is provisioned by the Terraform Apply step in **Environment** section and then mapped to that stage's target **Infrastructure**.

At deployment runtime, Harness does the following: 

1. Provisions the target environment using your script/template.
2. Uses the script/template outputs to locate it and deploy to it.

### Dynamic provisioning outputs for mapping

To use dynamic provisioning, you map outputs from your provisioner script/template that tell Harness what infrastructure to provision and use as the deployment target infrastructure.

You use these outputs in Harness expressions that you enter in the Harness infrastructure settings.

The format for the expression is `<+provisioner.OUTPUT_NAME>`.

For example, if a Terraform script has the following output, the expression is `<+provisioner.default_namespace>`:

```
output "default_namespace" {
  value = kubernetes_namespace.example.metadata[0].name
}
```

Here you can see the expression used to map the output in the infrastructure settings:

## Using ad hoc and dynamic provisioning together

Ad hoc and dynamic provisioning can be used together. 

For example, you can: 

1. Dynamically provision the target deployment Kubernetes namespace in the stage **Environment**.
2. Deploy your services to the provisioned namespace in the stage **Execution**. 
3. Use subsequent ad hoc provisioning steps in **Execution** to change the provisioned namespace, etc.

Dynamic provisioning is configured in a CD Deploy stage's **Environment** settings and ad hoc provisioning is configured in its **Execution** settings.

At deployment runtime, Harness processes the **Environment** settings first, along with its dynamic provisioning, followed by the **Execution** settings, containing its ad hoc provisioning.

Consequently, the **Environment** settings cannot reference subsequent **Execution** settings, but the **Execution** settings can reference previous **Environment** settings.

For example, if you dynamically provisioned a Kubernetes namespace in the **Environment** settings and mapped the namespace output using the expression `<+provisioner.default_namespace>`, you can reference the namespace in the **Execution** steps settings using the same expression, including any files that those steps use. 

But if you performed ad hoc provisioning in the **Execution** steps, you cannot reference the outputs of those steps in the **Environment** settings.

## Service Instances (SIs) consumption

Harness Service Instances (SIs) aren't consumed and no other licensing is required when a Harness stage uses Azure ARM to provision resources.

When Harness deploys artifacts via Harness services to the provisioned infrastructure in the same stage or pipeline, SIs licensing is consumed.
