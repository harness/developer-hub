Harness has first-class support for HashiCorp [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) as an infrastructure provisioner.

Use the following procedural topics for Terraform provisioning:

* **Plan:** [Plan Terraform Provisioning with the Terraform Plan Step](/docs/continuous-delivery/cd-infrastructure/terraform-infra/run-a-terraform-plan-with-the-terraform-plan-step)
* **Apply:** [Provision with the Terraform Apply Step](/docs/continuous-delivery/cd-infrastructure/terraform-infra/run-a-terraform-plan-with-the-terraform-apply-step)
* **Remove:** [Remove Provisioned Infra with the Terraform Destroy Step](/docs/continuous-delivery/cd-infrastructure/terraform-infra/remove-provisioned-infra-with-terraform-destroy)
* **Rollback:** [Rollback Provisioned Infra with the Terraform Rollback Step](/docs/continuous-delivery/cd-infrastructure/terraform-infra/rollback-provisioned-infra-with-the-terraform-rollback-step)

Review the following topics for additional Terraform provisioning features in Harness:

- For a conceptual overview of Harness Terraform integration, go to [Terraform provisioning overview](/docs/continuous-delivery/cd-infrastructure/terraform-infra/terraform-provisioning-with-harness/).
- For information on provisioning the target deployment infrastructure for the stage, go to [Provision target deployment infrastructure dynamically with Terraform](/docs/continuous-delivery/cd-infrastructure/terraform-infra/provision-infra-dynamically-with-terraform).
- For information on using Harness with Terraform Cloud and Enterprise workspaces, go to  [Terraform Cloud provisioning](/docs/continuous-delivery/cd-infrastructure/terraform-infra/terraform-cloud-deployments).
