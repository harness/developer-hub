## Active CD Feature flags

Some Harness CD features are released behind feature flags to get feedback from specific customers before releasing the features to the general audience. Feature development statuses are categorized as [Beta, GA, or Limited GA](/docs/platform/get-started/release-status).

The following table describes active feature flags relevant to Harness CD.
