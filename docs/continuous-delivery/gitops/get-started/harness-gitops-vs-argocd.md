## Overview

Argo CD, an open-source GitOps tool, is widely used for managing application synchronization and deployments. However, enterprises often require additional features like security, compliance, advanced automation, and governance, which is where Harness GitOps excels. As part of the broader Harness platform, Harness GitOps seamlessly integrates with CI/CD, Continuous Verification (CV), security testing, and monitoring, making it a more comprehensive solution for enterprises.

This comparison dives into the key capabilities of Argo CD vs. Harness GitOps, helping you determine the right GitOps solution for your organization

## Feature Comparison

| Functionality | Argo CD | Harness GitOps |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unified Management | Standalone GitOps tool, requires additional tools for full management. | Unified platform that integrates GitOps, CI/CD, monitoring, and verification in one place for improved productivity and simpler operations. |
| Mode of Operation | Argo CD provides a way to sync applications via UI, CLI, or API. | Harness provides multiple options to sync GitOps applications. You can do it either via [Manual Sync](/docs/continuous-delivery/gitops/application/sync-gitops-applications) in the UI or via a [GitOps PR Pipeline](/docs/continuous-delivery/gitops/pr-pipelines/pr-pipelines-basics). |
| Governance & Auditing | - Basic [built-in roles](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/rbac/#basic-built-in-roles).<br/>- RBAC is not fully configurable through the UI and requires defining roles and permissions manually using YAML configuration files in the `argocd-rbac-cm` ConfigMap.<br/>- Includes basic logging of events and actions, such as deployments and user activity. For full enterprise governance, you may need additional integrations or third-party tools to meet enterprise-grade security and auditing requirements. | - Audit logs are available for GitOps application syncs via [PR pipelines](/docs/continuous-delivery/gitops/pr-pipelines/pr-pipelines-basics).<br/>- **Access Control (RBAC)** provides fine-grained access control for PR Pipelines, ensuring only authorized users can perform specific actions on the pipeline. |
| Continuous Verification (CV) | Argo CD does not natively provide Continuous Verification (CV), which is a critical feature for monitoring the health of applications post-deployment. However, it can be extended by integrating with other tools, such as Prometheus or Flare for monitoring, or by using external systems to track deployment success and failures. | Harness allows you to utilize built-in [Continuous Verification (CV)](/docs/continuous-delivery/verify/cv-whats-supported) in your PR Pipeline. It integrates with over 10 health sources to monitor deployment health and performance in real time, ensuring stable production environments. |
| Rollback & Failure Management | Rollback is triggered by reverting to a previous commit in Git and syncing. It can be triggered manually via the UI or CLI. | - Harness GitOps can be integrated with CI/CD pipelines, so rollback can be tied to deployment strategies and approvals.<br/>- Users can leverage Harness fine-grained rollback capabilities in their GitOps PR Pipelines, such as automatic rollbacks on failure (based on [failure strategies](/docs/platform/pipelines/failure-handling/define-a-failure-strategy-for-pipelines)) and [post-production rollbacks](/docs/continuous-delivery/manage-deployments/rollback-deployments). |
| SSO | Supports [SSO](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/user-management/) with OAuth2, OIDC, LDAP, and SAML but requires manual configuration via a ConfigMap. | Harness supports multiple [identity providers (IdPs)](/docs/platform/authentication/multiple-identity-providers) for user authentication using SAML. It offers seamless [SSO](/docs/platform/authentication/single-sign-on-saml) integration in your Harness account with enterprise identity providers like Okta, LDAP, and other SAML providers using a UI-based setup. |
| Multi-Cluster Management | **Cluster registration**: By default, Argo CD manages applications in the same cluster where it is installed. Additional clusters must be manually registered using the Argo CD CLI (`argocd cluster add <cluster-name>`). | Harness provides automated cluster registration through the UI. There is no need for manual CLI commands. All clusters are managed from a single control plane, reducing complexity. Users can deploy applications across multiple clusters with unified visibility. |
| Support & SLAs | Community-based support. | Community-based support and dedicated enterprise support with SLAs for critical environments, ensuring faster issue resolution and higher system uptime. |
| Security Testing Orchestration (STO) | Argo CD itself does not provide built-in security scanning but can be integrated with third-party security tools like BlackDuck, Snyk, Trivy, and SonarQube for security checks. | Harness allows users to natively integrate [Security Testing Orchestration (STO)](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/overview) without needing separate CI/CD steps in their GitOps PR Pipelines. |
| Notifications | Uses the Argo CD Notifications Controller and supports Slack, email, webhooks, and Microsoft Teams (requires manual setup). | Users can leverage [notifications](/docs/continuous-delivery/x-platform-cd-features/cd-steps/notify-users-of-pipeline-events.md) for their PR Pipelines with UI-based configuration, supporting Slack, Microsoft Teams, email, webhooks, and Jira. |
| Dashboard | Basic UI for monitoring sync status and application health. | - Provides a GitOps Dashboard that displays essential GitOps-related information, including the number of clusters, applications, and repositories, along with application sync and health status.<br/>- Users can also utilize the [Service Dashboard](/docs/continuous-delivery/monitor-deployments/monitor-cd-deployments) to view deployed instances, counts, and application details synced via Harness Pipelines.<br/>- Additionally, Harness supports [Custom Dashboards](/docs/continuous-delivery/monitor-deployments/using-cd-custom-dashboards#deployments-and-services-v2-behind-ff), allowing users to create customizable dashboards to monitor deployment activities for GitOps PR Pipelines. |
| Infrastructure Provisioning | Argo CD does not provide built-in infrastructure provisioning and relies on external tools like Terraform, Helm, or Crossplane. | Users can directly [provision infrastructure](/docs/continuous-delivery/cd-infrastructure/provisioning-overview) within Harness GitOps PR Pipelines using infrastructure provisioning tools like Terraform and CloudFormation, with a UI-driven setup for seamless automation. |
| Terraform support | No native Terraform support; requires external tools like the Argo CD Terraform Controller. | Harness supports all entities using [Terraform](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/automation/terraform/harness-terraform-provider-overview/), allowing users to automate pipelines, GitOps Agents, and applications. |
| Performance & Scalability | Designed to scale as a GitOps controller, but multi-tenant, large-cluster, or multi-cluster topologies often require additional component tuning (Redis, reposerver, API server) and manual horizontal scaling and sharding. | Built on Argo CD for core reconciliation but adds GitOps Agents, PR Pipelines, and centralized control-plane services that are designed for large-scale, multi-org deployments. Scaling clusters, agents, and pipelines is managed from the Harness UI and APIs, with observability and rate limiting built in to reduce blast radius. |
| Operational Overhead | Operators are responsible for installing, upgrading, backing up, and monitoring the full Argo CD stack plus any surrounding tools (SSO, notifications, observability, security scans). Enterprise hardening usually involves significant in-house engineering effort. | Harness runs the control plane as a managed SaaS (or self-managed in some editions) and includes lifecycle management, audit, security, and observability out of the box. GitOps teams focus on defining applications, policies, and pipelines instead of maintaining the GitOps tooling, which reduces day-2 operational overhead in large organizations. |
