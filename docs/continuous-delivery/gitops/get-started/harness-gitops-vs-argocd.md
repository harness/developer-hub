## Overview

ArgoCD, an open-source GitOps tool, is widely used for managing application synchronization and deployments. However, enterprises often require additional features like security, compliance, advanced automation, and governance, which is where Harness GitOps excels. As part of the broader Harness platform, Harness GitOps seamlessly integrates with CI/CD, Continuous Verification (CV), security testing, and monitoring, making it a more comprehensive solution for enterprises.

This comparison dives into the key capabilities of ArgoCD vs. Harness GitOps, helping you determine the right GitOps solution for your organization

## Feature Comparison

| Functionality | ArgoCD | Harness GitOps |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unified Management | Standalone GitOps tool, requires additional tools for full management. | Unified platform that integrates GitOps, CI/CD, monitoring, and verification in one place for improved productivity and simpler operations. |
| Mode of Operation | ArgoCD provides a way to sync applications via UI,CLI or API. | Harness Provide multiple options to sync GitOps Application, you can do it either via [Manual Sync](/docs/continuous-delivery/gitops/use-gitops/sync-gitops-applications) in UI or via [GitOps PR Pipeline](/docs/continuous-delivery/gitops/pr-pipelines/pr-pipelines-basics). |
| Governance & Auditing | <li>ArgoCD has basic [built-in roles](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/rbac/#basic-built-in-roles).</li>  <li> ArgoCD RBAC is not fully configurable through the UI. It requires defining roles and permissions manually using YAML configuration files in the argocd-rbac-cm ConfigMap.</li> <li>ArgoCD includes basic logging of events and actions, such as deployments and user activity.For full enterprise governance, you may need additional integrations or third-party tools to ensure that ArgoCD meets enterprise-grade security and auditing requirements.</li> | <li>Audit logs are available for GitOps application syncs via [PR pipelines](/docs/continuous-delivery/gitops/pr-pipelines/pr-pipelines-basics).</li> <li>**Access Control (RBAC)**: RBAC allows fine-grained access control for PR Pipelines, ensuring only authorized users can perform specific actions on the Pipeline.</li> |
| Continuous Verification (CV) | ArgoCD does not natively provide Continuous Verification (CV), which is a critical feature for monitoring the health of applications post-deployment. However, it can be extended by integrating with other tools, such as Prometheus or Flare for monitoring, or using external systems to track deployment success and failures. | Harness allows you to utilize built-in [Continuous Verification (CV)](/docs/continuous-delivery/verify/cv-whats-supported)  in your PR Pipeline that integrates with over 10+ health sources to monitor deployment health and performance in real-time, ensuring stable production environments. |
| Rollback & Failure Management | Rollback is triggered by reverting to a previous commit in Git and syncing. Can be triggered manually via UI or CLI | <li> Harness GitOps can be integrated with CI/CD pipelines, so rollback can be tied to deployment strategies and approvals.</li><li> Users can leverage Harness fine-grained rollback capabilities in their GitOps PR Pipeline, such as automatic rollbacks on failure (based on [failure strategies](/docs/platform/pipelines/failure-handling/define-a-failure-strategy-for-pipelines)), [post production rollback](/docs/continuous-delivery/manage-deployments/rollback-deployments).</li> |
| SSO | Supports [SSO](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/user-management/) with OAuth2, OIDC, LDAP, SAML but requires manual configuration via ConfigMap. | Harness supports multiple [identity providers (IdPs)](/docs/platform/authentication/multiple-identity-providers) for user authentication using SAML. Seamless [SSO](/docs/platform/authentication/single-sign-on-saml) integration in your Harness account with enterprise identity providers like Okta,LDAP,SAML etc. with a UI-based setup. |
| Multi-Cluster Management | **Cluster Registration**: By default, ArgoCD manages applications in the same cluster where it is installed. Additional clusters must be manually registered using the ArgoCD CLI (`argocd cluster add <cluster-name>`). | Harness provides automated cluster registration through the UI. No need for manual CLI commands, unlike ArgoCD. All clusters are managed from a single control plane, reducing complexity. Users can deploy applications across multiple clusters with unified visibility. |
| Support & SLAs| Community-based support | Community-based support and dedicated enterprise support with SLAs for critical environments, ensuring faster issue resolution and system uptime. |
| Security Testing Orchestration (STO) | ArgoCD itself does not provide built-in security scanning but can be integrated with third-party security tools like BlackDuck, Snyk, Trivy, and SonarQube for security checks. | Harness allows users to natively integrate [Security Testing Orchestration (STO)](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/get-started/overview) without needing separate CI/CD steps in their GitOps PR Pipeline. |
| Notifications | Uses ArgoCD Notifications Controller, supports Slack, Email, Webhooks, MS Teams (requires manual setup). | Users can leverage [notifications](/docs/continuous-delivery/x-platform-cd-features/cd-steps/notify-users-of-pipeline-events.md) for their PR pipeline with UI based configuration, supporting Slack, MS Teams, Email, Webhooks, Jira. |
| Dashboard | Basic UI for monitoring sync status and application health | <li>Harness provides a GitOps Dashboard that displays essential GitOps-related information, including the number of clusters, applications, and repositories, along with application sync and health status.</li><li> Users can also utilize the [Service Dashboard](/docs/continuous-delivery/monitor-deployments/monitor-cd-deployments) to view deployed instances along with their counts as well as Application details synced via Harness Pipeline.</li><li> Additionally, Harness supports [Custom Dashboards](/docs/continuous-delivery/monitor-deployments/using-cd-custom-dashboards#deployments-and-services-v2-behind-ff), allowing users to create customizable dashboards to monitor their deployment activities for GitOps PR Pipelines.</li> |
| Terraform support  | No native Terraform support; requires external tools like the ArgoCD Terraform Controller. | Harness supports all entities using [Terraform](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/automation/terraform/harness-terraform-provider-overview/), allowing users to automate pipelines, GitOps agents, and applications. |
| Infrastructure Provisioning | ArgoCD does not provide built-in infrastructure provisioning and relies on external tools like Terraform, Helm, or Crossplane. | Users can directly [provision infrastructure](/docs/continuous-delivery/cd-infrastructure/provisioning-overview) within Harness GitOps PR pipelines using infra provisioning tools like Terraform, CloudFormation with a UI-driven setup for seamless automation. |

## Conclusion


Both **ArgoCD** and **Harness GitOps** provide GitOps capabilities for managing Kubernetes applications, but the right choice depends on your enterprise needs.

- If youâ€™re looking for a **standalone, open-source** GitOps tool with basic functionality and community support, **ArgoCD** may be a good choice.
- However, if your organization requires **enterprise-grade security, governance, compliance, automation, and scalability, Harness GitOps** is the superior choice.


With **native Continuous Verification (CV), automated rollbacks, security testing integration, UI-driven multi-cluster management, Terraform support, and enterprise SLAs**, Harness GitOps **eliminates the complexity** of managing GitOps at scale.

For enterprises looking to **streamline deployments, improve security, and enhance governance, Harness GitOps provides a comprehensive, all-in-one solution that extends beyond traditional GitOps implementations**.
