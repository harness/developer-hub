You can manage your applications through the **Applications** found in **GitOps Overview** page. 

<DocVideo src="https://app.tango.us/app/embed/Navigating-GitOps-to-Access-Applications-in-Harness-cad0aa3f8abd4f1d96af0e482c51729e" title="Navigating GitOps to Access Applications in Harness" />

## New Applications

Create a new application by click **+New Application** in the top right. To learn more about creating applications, go to [Add a Harness GitOps Application](/docs/continuous-delivery/gitops/get-started/harness-cd-git-ops-quickstart#step-4-add-a-harness-gitops-application)

## Application Operations

Applications are displayed on this page as a series of tiles. You can change this to a list of rows in the top right. 

Each application will display various helpful information such as the application repository or a name and link to the GitOps Agent. 

Each tile will have 3 vertical dots. Clicking this will allow you to manually **Sync**, **Refresh**, or **Delete** the application. 

See the following to learn more about some of these operations:
- [Sync Applications](/docs/continuous-delivery/gitops/use-gitops/sync-gitops-applications)
- [Refresh Applications](/docs/continuous-delivery/gitops/get-started/harness-git-ops-basics#refresh)

## Filter Applications

At the top you can filter your applications using a search bar and application attributes.

### Create and Save Filters

You can also create and save custom filters so that you can make sure you're only looking at relevant applications consistently. 

:::note

This feature is currently behind the feature flag `GITOPS_FILTER_PANE_ENABLED`. To enable this feature, contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io)

:::

To create and save a filter, do the following:

1. Create a filter by doing any of the following:
    - Add a custom search term
    - Choose to filter by **Agents**, **Sync Status**, **Health Status**, etc.
    - Add an additional filter field by clicking the **+Add Filter** button.
2. Click **Save**
3. Enter a name for the filter, and choose if you want it visible to **Only me** or **Everyone** in the scope. 

Then you're done!

You can then load the filter each subsequent time by clicking the filter icon to the right of **Reset** and searching for your filter there. 

## Ignore HPA Changes to Prevent Out-of-Sync Status

When Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) is enabled, pod scaling can cause GitOps to detect unwanted differences and mark applications as out of sync. 

To prevent this, configure the following in the application to ignore differences on replicas:

```yaml
ignoreDifferences:
    - group: apps
      kind: Deployment
      jsonPointers:
        - /spec/replicas
    - group: apps
      kind: StatefulSet
      jsonPointers:
        - /spec/replicas
syncPolicy: 
  syncOptions: 
  - RespectIgnoreDifferences=true
```

Alternatively, you can add the following to the Argo ConfigMap:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: argocd-cm
data:
  resource.customizations: |
    apps/Deployment:^(app-with-hpa|hpa-enabled-.*|.*-autoscaled)$:
      ignoreDifferences: |
        jsonPointers:
        - /spec/replicas
```
