## Values YAML overrides and merges

You can specify values YAML files at the environment's **Service Overrides** and **Configuration**, and the service itself.

Here is an example of specifying it at the environment's **Configuration**:

When you have a values yaml file at two or more of the environment **Service Overrides**, **Environment Configuration**, and the service itself, Harness merges the files into a single values YAML for deployment. This merging is performed at pipeline execution runtime.

Overriding occurs when the higher priority setting has the same `name:value` pair as a lower priority setting.

Let's look at two examples.

### Merging values YAML name:value pairs

An environment's **Service Overrides** values YAML has the name:value pair `servicePort: 80` but no `replicas` name:value.

A service's **Service Definition** has a values YAML with `replicas: 2` but no `servicePort` name:value.

At runtime, the two values YAML files are merged into one.

The `servicePort: 80` from the environment **Service Overrides** values YAML is merged with the **Service Definition**'s `replicas: 2` in the values YAML:

### Fully overriding values YAML name:value pairs

An environment's **Service Overrides** values YAML has the name:value pairs `replicas: 2` and `servicePort: 80`. 

A service's **Service Definition** has a values YAML with `replicas: 4` and `servicePort: 8080`. 

At runtime, the name:value pairs from the environment **Service Overrides** values YAML fully override the service values YAML. The `replicas: 2` and `servicePort: 80` from the environment **Service Overrides** are used.
