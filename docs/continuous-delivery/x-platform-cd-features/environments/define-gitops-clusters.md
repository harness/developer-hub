## GitOps Clusters

When you use Harness GitOps you can add GitOps clusters to an environment.Â 

To learn more about Harness GitOps, go to [Harness GitOps Basics](../cd-gitops/harness-git-ops-basics.md). 

Next, when you create a pipeline, you can select the environment and the GitOps cluster(s) to use.

GitOps clusters are used in a PR pipeline. A PR pipeline creates and merges a Git PR on the `config.json` for a destination cluster as part of an ApplicationSet. The PR Pipeline runs, merges a change to the config.json, and a GitOps sync on the ApplicationSet is initiated.

GitOps Clusters are not used in standard CD pipelines. They're used when using GitOps only.
