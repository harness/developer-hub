In the environment **Configuration**, you can manage the **Name**, **Description**, **Tags**, and **Environment Type** of the environment.

You can also set default manifests, specifications, config files, and variables to use whenever Harness deploys a service to this environment.

For example, a stage has a Kubernetes service with a manifest but whenever that service is deployed to the **QA** environment, the manifest in that environment's **Configuration** overwrites the namespace of with the manifest in the service with `QA`.
