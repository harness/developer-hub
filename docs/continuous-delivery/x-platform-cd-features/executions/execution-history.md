## Execution Reference

Each pipeline execution displays the following information.

* **Pipeline Name**
    - The name of the pipeline and execution ID.
    - When expanded, this column also shows the name of each stage in the pipeline. 
* **Status**
    - Shows the status of the execution. The options are `SUCCESS`, `FAILED`, `ABORTED`, `EXPIRED`.
    - When expanded, this column shows the status of each stage as an emoji. You can hover over the emoji for more information.
* **Service**
    - Shows the services used in the pipeline. For pipelines with more than one service, a `+X` modifier will be displayed where `X` is the number of additional services. 
    - When expanded, this column shows the services used in each individual stage of the pipeline.
    - Hover over the service name to see the artifact attached to the service. 
* **Environment**
    - Shows the infrastructure used in the pipeline. For pipelines with more than one associated environment, a `+X` modifier will be displayed where `X` is the number of additional environments.
    - When expanded, this column shows the environment for each individual stage of the pipeline.
    - Hover over the environment name to see the infrastructure associated with the environment.
* **Trigger** (This column is unlabeled)
    - This column shows the origin of each execution.
* **Execution Start Time**
    - Shows the user, method, and start time of the execution.
