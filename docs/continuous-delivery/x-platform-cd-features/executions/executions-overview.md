Execution is how a stage deploys its service to its infrastructure.

When you first define the execution, Harness automatically provides the steps needed for your execution strategy.

Most deployment types offer Canary, Rolling, and Blue-Green deployment steps out of the box.

You can add many more steps like Verify steps for Continuous Verification, Shell Script steps to run scripts on the Delegate or target hosts, or Manual, Jira, and ServiceNow Approval steps.
