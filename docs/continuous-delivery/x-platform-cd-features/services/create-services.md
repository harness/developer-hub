Services represent your microservices and other workloads. Each service contains a **Service Definition** that defines your deployment artifacts, manifests or specifications, configuration files, and service-specific variables.

## Create a service

You can create services from: 
* Within a pipeline
* Outside a pipeline 
* An account
* An Organization

If you are new to Harness, review [Harness key concepts](/docs/get-started/key-concepts.md) and [create your first CD pipeline](/tutorials/cd-pipelines/kubernetes/manifest).

```mdx-code-block
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
```
```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Within a pipeline" label="Within a pipeline">
```

To create a service from inside of a pipeline, select the **Services** tab of a new CD stage, then select **New Service**.

![](./static/services-and-environments-overview-10.png)

Once the service and its service definition are saved, you can select it in any pipeline.

When you select the service in a pipeline, you can select **Edit Service** to edit its **Service Definition**.

When you create the new service you define its **Service Definition**. For example, a Kubernetes **Service Definition** with a Kubernetes manifest and Docker artifact.

```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Outside a pipeline" label="Outside a pipeline">
```

To create a service from outside of a pipeline, you use **Services** in the navigation pane.

![](./static/services-and-environments-overview-09.png)

```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="From organization or account" label="From organization or account">
```

You can create a service at an account or organization level from the Pipeline Studio, APIs, or Terraform.

```mdx-code-block
import Tabs2 from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem2 from '@theme/TabItem';
```
```mdx-code-block
<Tabs2>
  <TabItem2 value="Pipeline Studio" label="Pipeline Studio">
```
To create a service at an account or organization level, go to **Organization Resources** **>Services**.

Creating an account level service enables you to manage the service globally across the organizations and projects within the account. 

An account level service can only reference connectors for the manifests and artifacts within the account. These services are global and cannot have dependencies at a lower hierarchy level.

Shared services can also be created and managed at account or organization levels.

![](./static/create-services-from-account-level.png)

:::note
When using an account level deployment stage template, you can referencing an account level service only. Similarly, for organization level stage templates, you can reference organization level services only. 

However, when using a deployment stage in a pipeline that has service configured as a runtime input, you can pick services from project, organization, or account levels to pass them as runtime inputs based on your RBAC. 

Go to [add a stage template](/docs/platform/templates/add-a-stage-template.md) for more information.

For information about creating a service API, go to [create a service](https://apidocs.harness.io/tag/Services#operation/createServiceV2).

The `orgIdentifier` and `projectIdentifier` field definitions are optional, and depend on where you want to create the service. For example, if you create a service at an account level, you will not need org or project identifiers in the post API call payload.

For information about creating a Harness platform service, go to [harness_platform_service (Resource)](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/harness/harness/latest/docs/resources/platform_service).

The `org_id` and `project_id` field definitions are optional, and depend on where you want to create the service. For example, if you create a service at an account level, you will not need org or project identifiers.

  ## SERVICE V2 UPDATE

  ## It isn't mandatory for Service creation 
  ## It is mandatory for Service use in a pipeline

## Runtime inputs and expressions in services

If you use runtime inputs for settings in a service, you will need to provide values for these inputs when you run the pipeline using the service.

If you use expressions in a service, Harness must be able to resolve these expressions when users run the pipeline using the service.

Let's look at an example.

1. In a Harness Deploy stage, in **Service**, select **Runtime input** for the service.
   
   ![](./static/services-and-environments-runtime-input-01.png)
2. When you run the pipeline, you can select the service to use.
   
   ![](./static/services-and-environments-runtime-input-02.png)

Now you can provide values for any runtime inputs in the service. Let's go into more detail in the next section.

:::note

For more information on runtime inputs and expressions, go to [Fixed Values, Runtime Inputs, and Expressions](/docs/platform/variables-and-expressions/runtime-inputs).

:::

### Selecting settings when the service is an expression

If you are using a runtime input for the service in a stage, and the service you are going to select has runtime inputs for some of its own settings, you can select inputs for these settings when you select the service in **Run Pipeline**.

Let's look at an example.

Here is a service with an artifact that has runtime inputs for its artifact **Tag** and **Digest** settings.

![picture 0](static/c150c96ef6caae9bd4124fb70d3a8f6550ad7d1f3577c65172c9c2643f1749a4.png)  

Next, when you run a pipeline that has the **Service** setting as a runtime input, you select the service that has runtime inputs for its artifact **Tag** and **Digest** settings.

As you can see, you can now select the artifact **Tag** and **Digest** settings.
