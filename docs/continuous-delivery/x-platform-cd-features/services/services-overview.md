A Harness service represents what you're deploying. You can create services in services or when you're building your pipelines. When you create a service in a pipeline, it's automatically added to services. You can add the same service to as many pipelines as you need.

Harness services are deployed to Harness environments. Select **Environments** to see the environments in this project.

In **Manage Services**, you can create, update, and delete your services' settings. For example, a service's variables and its manifest and artifact details.

In **Dashboard**, you can view service statistics such as deployment frequency, failure rate, and so on.
