# Google Cloud Run Deployments

:::note

Currently, this feature is behind the feature flag `CDS_GOOGLE_CLOUD_RUN`. Contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io) to enable the feature.

This topic explains how to deploy an artifact to Google Cloud Run using Harness.

## Deployment Summary

Here's a high-level summary of the setup steps:

1. Create a Harness CD pipeline.
2. Add a Deploy stage.
3. Select the deployment type **Google Cloud Run**, and then select **Set Up Stage**.

4. Select **Add Service**.
   1. Add the **Google Cloud Run Service Manifest Definition** to the new Cloud Run service. Manifest Definition must define stateless, containerized applications that are compatible with Google Cloud Run

   Currently, we support only two Artifact Repository types: Google Artifact Repository and Docker Registry.
   
   2. Save the new service.
5. Select **New Environment**, name the new environment, and select **Save**.
6. In **Infrastructure Definition**, select **New Infrastructure**.
     
     In Google Cloud Provider Details, create or select the Harness GCP connector, **GCP project**, and **GCP region**, and select **Save**.

      - The user can provide a GCP Connector to authenticate with the Google Account.
        - **GCP Authentication Support**:
          - Google OIDC Support. Users can create an OIDC connector to connect to the GCP account. For more information, go to [Use OpenID Connect (OIDC) Connector](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/connectors/cloud-providers/ref-cloud-providers/gcs-connector-settings-reference/#use-openid-connect-oidc)
          - Service Account. Users can create a GCP connector by providing a Service Account. For more information, go to [Create a GCP connector](/docs/platform/connectors/cloud-providers/connect-to-google-cloud-platform-gcp/)
      - Users can provide a project ID to specify which project.
      - Users can provide a region to specify the region they want to deploy the Cloud Run service.
      
7. In the **Execution** tab, select the deployment strategy. Currently, Harness supports the **Basic** and **Canary** deployment strategies
   
   Harness automatically adds the **Deploy Cloud Run Step Group** based on the strategy you select:
   - For **Basic Strategy**, the following steps are automatically added:
      1. Download Manifest
      2. Google Cloud Run Prepare Rollback
      3. Google Cloud Run Deploy Step

      ![](static/google-cloud-run-2.png)

      Additionally, you can add Google Cloud Run Traffic Shift Step if required.

   - For **Canary Strategy**, the following steps are automatically added:
      1. Download Manifest
      2. Google Cloud Run Prepare Rollback
      3. Google Cloud Run Deploy Step
      4. Google Cloud Run Traffic Shift Step

      ![](static/google-cloud-run-3.png)
   
   All the configurations needed for the steps to run are passed as environment variables:
   1. **Download Manifest**:
      - Downloads the manifest specified in the service.
   2. **Google Cloud Run Prepare Rollback**:
      - Fetches the current configurations of the deployment and saves it. These details can be used during the rollback step.
      - The Prepare Rollback step uses the `gcloud run services describe` command to fetch the details of the service. For more information, go to [Google Cloud Run Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/run/services/replace).
   3. **Google Cloud Run Deploy Step**:
      - Applies the configurations YAML file and creates a new service or revision.
      - The Deploy Step uses the `gcloud run services replace` command to apply the YAML manifest provided by the user. For more information, go to [Google Cloud Run Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/run/services/replace).
      - Updates the container image field in the YAML manifest with the image provided in the service artifact, ensuring that the manifest reflects the correct configuration.
      - You can provide additional command options in the **Optional Configuration** under **Google Cloud Run Services Replace Command Options**.
      - Harness fetches the instance details configured by Google platform using the **Google Cloud Monitoring SDK** and saves them. These details can be viewed in the logs while running this step. For more information, go to [Google Cloud Run Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/custom-metrics/reading-metrics).
      
      **Note**: We do not use the Google Run Deploy command here as this command takes every field as a command flag. Instead, we use the replace command and replace all the configurations provided in the YAML file.
   4. **Google Cloud Run Traffic Shift Step**:
      - Controls traffic distribution across different revisions.
      - The Traffic Shift Step leverages the `gcloud run services update-traffic` command to manage traffic distribution between service revisions. For more information, go to [Google Cloud Run Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/run/services/update-traffic).
      - Users can specify the percentage of traffic each revision should serve under **Revision Traffic Details**.

      Additionally, you can have **Optional Configurations** such as:

      - **Pre-Execution Command**: Run commands before deployment.
      - **Image Pull Policy**: Specifies when the container image should be pulled from the registry.
      - **Run as User**: Configures the user identity under which the function or container should run, useful for security and access control.
      - **Limit Memory**: Defines the maximum memory that can be allocated to the container or function during execution.
      - **Limit CPU**: Sets a limit on the CPU usage for the function or container, ensuring the function does not consume excessive resources.
      - **Environment Variables**: Additional environment variables can be configured.

8. Define the rollback step:
   - **Rollback Step**:
     - Reverts services to previous configurations or states.
     - If itâ€™s the first deployment, the service is deleted using the `gcloud run services delete` command.
     - For subsequent deployments, traffic is redirected to older revisions using the `gcloud run services update-traffic` command.
     
     **Note**: Google Cloud Run does not allow you to delete the new revision. Only the traffic is diverted to the previous revisions.

10. Select **Save**, and then run the pipeline.

## Cloud Run Permission Requirements

When you set up a Harness GCP connector to connect Harness with your GCP account, the GCP IAM user or service account must have the appropriate permissions assigned to their account.

<details>
<summary>Cloud Functions Minimum Permissions</summary>

The following are the minimum set of permissions required for deploying Google Cloud Run functions:

1. **List, Get, and Describe Services**:
   - `run.services.list`
   - `run.services.get`

2. **Create or Deploy Services**:
   - `run.services.create`
   - `run.services.update`

3. **Delete Services**:
   - `run.services.delete`

4. **Invoke Cloud Run Services** (if needed for execution):
   - `run.routes.invoke`

5. **Get Service Monitoring Data for Instance Sync**:
   - `monitoring.timeSeries.list`

6. **View Configuration and Permissions**:
   - `run.configurations.list`
   - `run.configurations.get`

7. **Manage IAM Policies for Services**:
   - `resourcemanager.projects.getIamPolicy`
   - `resourcemanager.projects.setIamPolicy`

8. **Authentication Using OIDC**:
   - `iam.workloadIdentityPools.createCredentialConfig`

9. **Authentication Using Service Account Key**:
   - `iam.serviceAccounts.get`
   - `iam.serviceAccounts.signBlob`

Alternatively, the following roles can also be used:

1. **Cloud Run Admin (`roles/run.admin`)**:
   - Grants full administrative access to manage Cloud Run services, including creating, updating, and deleting services.
   - Essential for deploying services to Cloud Run.

2. **Service Account User (`roles/iam.serviceAccountUser`)**:
   - Grants permission to use service accounts, which are required to run Cloud Run services.
   - Necessary when deploying services that use specific service accounts for execution.

3. **Logging Viewer (`roles/logging.viewer`)**:
   - Access to logs for debugging Cloud Run services.

4. **Monitoring Viewer (`roles/monitoring.viewer`)**:
   - Permission to view service monitoring data.

5. **IAM Workload Identity Pool Admin (`roles/iam.workloadIdentityPoolAdmin`)**:
   - This role grants you the necessary permissions to create, update, and delete workload identity pools and providers.
