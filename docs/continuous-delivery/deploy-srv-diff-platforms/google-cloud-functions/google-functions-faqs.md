This article addresses some frequently asked questions about Google Cloud Function deployments in Harness.

### What is a Google Cloud Function deployment?

Harness supports deploying Google Functions [1st gen and 2nd gen](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/serverless/cloud-functions-2nd-generation-now-generally-available).

### What is the 1st gen support?

Harness supports the following:

- Basic deployments.
  - Harness deploys the new function and terminates the old one by sending 100% of traffic to the new function.
- For rollback, Harness does not perform revision-based rollback. Instead, in case of deployment failure, Harness will take a snapshot of the last known good state of the function and reapply

### What is the 2nd gen support?

Harness supports the following:

- Basic, blue green, and canary deployments.
- Harness leverages the Cloud Run revisions capability that Google Cloud offers to configure rollback.

### What are the limitations?

* For Google Cloud Functions 2nd gen, Harness does not support [Google Cloud Source Repository](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/deploy#from-source-repo) at this time. Only Google Cloud Storage is supported.
* For Google Cloud Functions 1st gen, Harness supports both Google Cloud Storage and Google Cloud Source.

### Does Harness support using the GCP connector configured to inherit permissions for making additional calls to the registry?

While the GCP connector inheriting permissions from the delegate can pull images, additional configurations may be needed to fetch the entry point. Also Harness uses the node pool's authentication configuration while pulling the image. Also Harness can't extract the secret and mount it under `imagePullSecrets` in this case. For more details, go to [Documentation](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/connectors/cloud-providers/ref-cloud-providers/gcs-connector-settings-reference#gcp-connector-settings)

### What are the specific IAM permissions that Harness requires for the GCP service account?
