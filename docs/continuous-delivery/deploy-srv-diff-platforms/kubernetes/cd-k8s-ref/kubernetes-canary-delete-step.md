This topic describes the **Canary Delete** step.

The **Canary Delete** step is used to clean up the workload deployed by the [Canary Deployment](/docs/continuous-delivery/deploy-srv-diff-platforms/kubernetes/cd-k8s-ref/canary-deployment-step) step.

The Canary Delete step usually follows a Canary Deployment step.

If the **Canary Deployment** step is successful, the stage will move onto the Primary step group and the Rolling Deployment step. The workload created by the **Canary Deployment** step is no longer needed.

## Canary Delete step vs Kubernetes Delete step

The **Canary Delete** step is only used to delete resources created using the **Canary Deployment** step. To delete any Kubernetes resources, use the Kubernetes Delete step. For details, go to [Delete Kubernetes Resources with the Kubernetes Delete Step](/docs/continuous-delivery/deploy-srv-diff-platforms/kubernetes/kubernetes-executions/delete-kubernetes-resources).
