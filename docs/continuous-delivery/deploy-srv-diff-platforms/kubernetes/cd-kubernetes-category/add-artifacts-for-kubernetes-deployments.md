This topic covers adding container image locations as Harness artifacts and referencing them in your Values files.

If a public Docker image location is hardcoded in your Kubernetes manifest (for example, `image: nginx:1.14.2`), then you can simply add the manifest to Harness and the Harness Delegate will pull the image during deployment.

Alternatively, you can add the image location to Harness as an artifact in the **Service Definition**. This allows you to reference the image in your manifests and elsewhere using the Harness expression `<+artifacts.primary.image>`.

When you deploy, Harness connects to your repo and you select which image and version/tag to deploy.

With a Harness artifact, you can template your manifests, detaching them from a hardcoded location. This makes your manifests reusable and dynamic.

## Before you begin

Make sure you've reviewed and set up the following:

* [Kubernetes Deployments Overview](/docs/continuous-delivery/deploy-srv-diff-platforms/kubernetes/kubernetes-deployments-overview)

## Artifacts and manifests in Harness

There are several scenarios to consider before you use artifacts and manifests in the Harness stage:

### Public artifact hardcoded in the manifest

If the image location is hardcoded in your Kubernetes manifest (for example, `image: nginx:1.14.2`), you do not need to use the **Artifacts** settings in the Harness Service Definition. The Harness Delegate will pull the image at runtime. You simply need to ensure that the Delegate can connect to the public repo.

### Public artifact is not hardcoded in the manifest

In this scenario, you'll use the **Artifacts** settings in the Harness Service Definition to identify the artifact to use and select the image and tag in Harness at runtime.

+ **Primary artifact:** In your manifest, you can refer to the primary artifact you set up in Harness using the expression, `<+artifacts.primary.image>`: `image: <+artifacts.primary.image>`.
+ **Sidecar artifacts:** In your manifest, you can refer to the sidecar artifact you set up in Harness using the expression, `<+artifacts.sidecars.[sidecar_identifier].imagePath>`.  
In this example, `[sidecar_identifier]` is the sidecar identifier you specified when you added the sidecar artifact to Harness.

<details>
<summary>Example output for all artifact expressions</summary>

Here's an example where we use a Shell Script step to echo all the artifact expressions.

```
echo "artifacts.primary.image: "<+artifacts.primary.image>
echo "artifacts.primary.connectorRef: "<+artifacts.primary.connectorRef>
echo "artifacts.primary.digest: "<+artifacts.primary.digest>
echo "artifacts.primary.identifier: "<+artifacts.primary.identifier>
echo "artifacts.primary.imagePath: "<+artifacts.primary.imagePath>
echo "artifacts.primary.imagePullSecret: "<+artifacts.primary.imagePullSecret>
echo "artifacts.primary.label: "<+artifacts.primary.label>
echo "artifacts.primary.metadata: "<+artifacts.primary.metadata>
echo "artifacts.primary.primaryArtifact: "<+artifacts.primary.primaryArtifact>
echo "artifacts.primary.tag: "<+artifacts.primary.tag>
echo "artifacts.primary.type: "<+artifacts.primary.type>
```

Here's the output:

```
Executing command ...
artifacts.primary.image: index.docker.io/johndoe/tweetapp:21
artifacts.primary.connectorRef: Docker_Hub_with_Pwd
artifacts.primary.digest: null
artifacts.primary.identifier: primary
artifacts.primary.imagePath: johndoe/tweetapp
artifacts.primary.imagePullSecret: 123abc
artifacts.primary.metadata: {image=index.docker.io/johndoe/tweetapp:21, tag=21}
artifacts.primary.primaryArtifact: true
artifacts.primary.tag: 21
artifacts.primary.type: DockerRegistry
Command completed with ExitCode (0)
```

</details>


### Private repo artifact

In some cases, your Kubernetes cluster might not have the permissions needed to access a private repository (GCR, etc). For these cases, you use the expression, `<+artifacts.primary.imagePullSecret>` in the Values file and reference it in the Secret and Deployment objects in your manifest.  
This key will import the credentials from the Docker credentials file in the artifact.  
[Example Manifests](#example-manifests)

### Service account of the Kubernetes Delegate can pull from the private repo

If the Kubernetes service account used by the Connector or Delegate has permission to pull from the private repo, you do not need to use the **Artifacts** settings in the Harness Service Definition. You can hardcode the image location in the manifest, and the Delegate will pull it at runtime.  

If multiple Delegates are selected, make sure that all of their service accounts have permission to pull from the private repo.

### Sidecar artifacts

Sidecar artifacts follow the same rules as primary artifacts.  

If you do not hardcode the sidecar image location in the manifest, you will use the **Artifacts** settings in the Harness Service Definition to identify the sidecar artifact to use and select the image and tag in Harness at runtime.  

As explained above, in your Values file, refer to the sidecar artifact you set up in Harness using the expression, `<+artifacts.sidecars.[sidecar_identifier].imagePath>:<+artifacts.sidecars.[sidecar_identifier].tag>`.  

In this example, `[sidecar_identifier]` is the sidecar identifier you specified when you added the sidecar artifact.

## Container registry support

Harness supports all of the popular container registries. You can add your container registry account as a Harness Connector.

The Connector can be added in line when you select your artifacts or separately in **Project Setup** (for Projects) or **Account Resources** (for accounts).

For more information, go to [CD artifact sources](/docs/continuous-delivery/x-platform-cd-features/services/artifact-sources).

## Primary and sidecar artifacts

You can add a primary artifact and multiple sidecar artifacts. The sidecars are treated the same as the primary artifact. Both are deployed to the target infrastructure in the **Infrastructure Definition**.

You don't need to create a separate Service for a sidecar artifact. Both are added in the Service Definition. The steps for adding them are the same.

You must select artifact versions at deployment runtime for all primary and sidecar artifacts.

## Add deploy stage


1. When you add a stage, select **Deploy**.
2. Name the stage, and select what you'd like to deploy. For example, select **Service**.
3. Click **Set Up Stage**. The new stage's settings appear.
4. Click **Next** or **Service**.

## Create the Harness service

In **Service**, you can define/select the Service and Service Definition.

Let's take a moment and review Harness Services and Service Definitions (which are explained below). Harness Services represent your microservices/apps logically.  
  
You can add the same Service to as many stages are you need. Service Definitions represent your artifacts, manifests, and variables physically. They are the actual files and variable values.  
  
By separating Services and Service Definitions, you can propagate the same Service across stages and change artifacts, manifests, and variables with each stage.Select or create the Service.

To add your container image, go to **Artifacts** in the Service Definition.

## Add the artifact source

1. In **Artifacts**, you add connections to the images in their repos. To demonstrate how to add the Artifact Source, we use a Docker image from a Docker Registry Connector.
2. In **Artifacts**, click **Add Primary** **Artifact.**
3. Select the **Artifact Repository Type**.

## Reference the artifact in your values.yaml file

In this example, the public artifact isn't hardcoded in the manifest and we reference the image in the Service Definition **Artifacts** section using the variable, `<+artifacts.primary.image>`.

For example, here's a reference in a Values file:


```yaml
...  
name: <+stage.variables.name>  
replicas: 2  
  
image: <+artifacts.primary.image>  
dockercfg: <+artifacts.primary.imagePullSecret>  
...
```

That `<+artifacts.primary.image>` will reference the **Primary** artifact.

In your manifests, you simply use the Go template reference to the `image` value (`{{.Values.image}}`):


```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1  
kind: Deployment  
...  
    spec:  
      {{- if .Values.dockercfg}}  
      imagePullSecrets:  
      - name: {{.Values.name}}-dockercfg  
      {{- end}}  
      containers:  
      - name: {{.Values.name}}  
        image: {{.Values.image}}  
...
```
[Example Manifests](#example-manifests)

## Add your manifests

Once your manifests and Values file are configured to use the artifact reference `<+artifacts.primary.image>`, you can add them to the Service.

See [Define Kubernetes Manifests](define-kubernetes-manifests.md).

## Add infrastructure and execution

Next, you'll add the target infrastructure and execution steps to your stage.

We won't cover those here, but see the [Kubernetes CD Quickstart](/docs/continuous-delivery/deploy-srv-diff-platforms/kubernetes/kubernetes-cd-quickstart.md) for a summary.

## Example manifests

Below are some examples of manifests using the Harness expression for the artifact you added in **Artifacts** (`<+artifacts.primary.image>`).

### Basic values YAML and manifests for public image

This is a simple example using the Artifact reference, `<+artifacts.primary.image>`. It can be used whenever the public image isn't hardcoded in manifests.

We use Go templating with a values.yaml file and manifests for deployment, namespace, and service. The manifests for deployment, namespace, and service are in a **templates** folder that is a peer of the values.yaml file.

<details>
<summary>values.yaml</summary>

This file uses the `image: <+artifacts.primary.image>` to identify the primary artifact added in **Artifacts**.

It also uses `name: <+stage.variables.name>` to reference a Stage variable `name`, and `namespace: <+infra.namespace>` to reference the namespace entered in the Stage's **Infrastructure Definition**. Service type and ports are hardcoded.

The name, image, and namespace values are referenced in the manifests described later.


```yaml
name: <+stage.variables.name>  
replicas: 2  
  
image: <+artifacts.primary.image>  
# dockercfg: <+artifacts.primary.imagePullSecret>  
  
createNamespace: true  
namespace: <+infra.namespace>  
  
# Service Type allow you to specify what kind of service you want.  
# Possible values for ServiceType are:  
# ClusterIP | NodePort | LoadBalancer | ExternalName  
serviceType: LoadBalancer  
  
# A Service can map an incoming port to any targetPort.  
# targetPort is where application is listening on inside the container.  
servicePort: 80  
serviceTargetPort: 80  
  
# Specify all environment variables to be added to the container.  
# The following two maps, config and secrets, are put into a ConfigMap  
# and a Secret, respectively.  
# Both are added to the container environment in podSpec as envFrom source.  
env:  
  config:  
    key1: value10  
  secrets:  
    key2: value2
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>templates/deployment.yaml</summary>

The deployment manifest references the name and image values from values.yaml. The manifest also contains the ConfigMap and Secret objects.


```go
{{- if .Values.env.config}}  
apiVersion: v1  
kind: ConfigMap  
metadata:  
  name: {{.Values.name}}  
data:  
{{.Values.env.config | toYaml | indent 2}}  
---  
{{- end}}  
  
{{- if .Values.env.secrets}}  
apiVersion: v1  
kind: Secret  
metadata:  
  name: {{.Values.name}}  
stringData:  
{{.Values.env.secrets | toYaml | indent 2}}  
---  
{{- end}}  
  
{{- if .Values.dockercfg}}  
apiVersion: v1  
kind: Secret  
metadata:  
  name: {{.Values.name}}-dockercfg  
  annotations:  
    harness.io/skip-versioning: true  
data:  
  .dockercfg: {{.Values.dockercfg}}  
type: kubernetes.io/dockercfg  
---  
{{- end}}  
  
apiVersion: apps/v1  
kind: Deployment  
metadata:  
  name: {{.Values.name}}-deployment  
spec:  
  replicas: {{int .Values.replicas}}  
  selector:  
    matchLabels:  
      app: {{.Values.name}}  
  template:  
    metadata:  
      labels:  
        app: {{.Values.name}}  
    spec:  
      {{- if .Values.dockercfg}}  
      imagePullSecrets:  
      - name: {{.Values.name}}-dockercfg  
      {{- end}}  
      containers:  
      - name: {{.Values.name}}  
        image: {{.Values.image}}  
        {{- if or .Values.env.config .Values.env.secrets}}  
        envFrom:  
        {{- if .Values.env.config}}  
        - configMapRef:  
            name: {{.Values.name}}  
        {{- end}}  
        {{- if .Values.env.secrets}}  
        - secretRef:  
            name: {{.Values.name}}  
        {{- end}}  
        {{- end}}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>templates/namespace.yaml</summary>

The namespace manifest references the namespace value from values.yaml.


```go
{{- if .Values.createNamespace}}  
apiVersion: v1  
kind: Namespace  
metadata:  
  name: {{.Values.namespace}}  
{{- end}}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>templates/service.yaml</summary>

The service manifest references the hardcoded service type and ports from values.yaml.


```go
apiVersion: v1  
kind: Service  
metadata:  
  name: {{.Values.name}}-svc  
spec:  
  type: {{.Values.serviceType}}  
  ports:  
  - port: {{.Values.servicePort}}  
    targetPort: {{.Values.serviceTargetPort}}  
    protocol: TCP  
  selector:  
    app: {{.Values.name}}
```

</details>

### Private artifact

When the image is in a private repo, you use the expression `<+artifacts.primary.imagePullSecret>` in the Secret and Deployment objects in your manifest.

This key will import the credentials from the Docker credentials file in the artifact.

It's much simpler to use the `<+artifacts.primary.imagePullSecret>` expression in the values.yaml file, and then reference it in other manifests.

Using the values.yaml file above, we simply remove the comment in front of `dockercfg: <+artifacts.primary.imagePullSecret>`:


```yaml
name: <+stage.variables.name>  
replicas: 2  
  
image: <+artifacts.primary.image>  
dockercfg: <+artifacts.primary.imagePullSecret>  
  
createNamespace: true  
namespace: <+infra.namespace>  
...
```

You don't need to make changes to the deployment manifest from earlier. It uses Go templating to check for the `dockercfg` value in values.yaml and applies it to Secret and Deployment.

If using the condition `{{- if .Values.dockercfg}}` to check for `dockercfg` in values.yaml.


```go
...  
{{- if .Values.dockercfg}}  
apiVersion: v1  
kind: Secret  
metadata:  
  name: {{.Values.name}}-dockercfg  
  annotations:  
    harness.io/skip-versioning: true  
data:  
  .dockercfg: {{.Values.dockercfg}}  
type: kubernetes.io/dockercfg  
---  
{{- end}}  
  
apiVersion: apps/v1  
kind: Deployment  
metadata:  
  name: {{.Values.name}}-deployment  
spec:  
  replicas: {{int .Values.replicas}}  
  selector:  
    matchLabels:  
      app: {{.Values.name}}  
  template:  
    metadata:  
      labels:  
        app: {{.Values.name}}  
    spec:  
      {{- if .Values.dockercfg}}  
      imagePullSecrets:  
      - name: {{.Values.name}}-dockercfg  
      {{- end}}  
      containers:  
      - name: {{.Values.name}}  
        image: {{.Values.image}}  
...
```
## Notes

* [Harness Variables and Expressions](/docs/platform/Variables-and-Expressions/harness-variables) may be added to Values files (for example values.yaml), not the manifests themselves. This provides more flexibility.
* The Values file used in a Harness Service Definition doesn't support Helm templating, **only Go templating**. Helm templating is fully supported in the remote Helm charts you add to your Harness Service Definition. See [Helm CD Quickstart](/docs/continuous-delivery/deploy-srv-diff-platforms/helm/helm-cd-quickstart).
* Harness uses Go template version 0.4. If you are used to Helm templating, you can download Go template and try it out locally to find out if your manifests will work. This can help you avoid issues when adding your manifests to Harness.
  * You can install Go template version 0.4 locally to test your manifests.

* Harness uses an internal build of Go templating. It cannot be upgraded. Harness uses [Spring templates functions](http://masterminds.github.io/sprig/), excluding those functions that provide access to the underlying OS (env, expandenv) for security reasons.
  * In addition, Harness uses the functions ToYaml, FromYaml, ToJson, FromJson.
