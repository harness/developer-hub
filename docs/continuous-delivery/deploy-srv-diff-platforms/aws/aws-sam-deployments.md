Harness supports AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model) deployments. SAM is an open-source framework provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that simplifies the deployment and management of serverless applications on AWS. It is an extension of AWS's infrastructure-as-code service, CloudFormation.

For SAM deployments in Harness, add your SAM directory to Harness and select the target region. Harness will perform the SAM build and deploy.

## Deployment summary

SAM deployments involve the following:

1. Create Harness SAM service.
   1. Add your SAM directory.
   2. Add a values.yaml file (optional). Harness supports Go templating with SAM templates and values.yaml files.
2. Create Harness SAM environment.
   1. Define the target infrastructure by adding a Harness AWS connector with the necessary AWS permissions for the deployment and a target AWS region.
3. Create Harness SAM pipeline stage.
   1. Select the Harness SAM service to use.
   2. Select the Harness SAM environment to use.
   3. Define deployment strategy. Harness automatically generates the steps required to deploy your SAM template.
4. Deploy pipeline.

## Supported integrations

For details on AWS support in Harness, including tooling, limitations, and repositories, go to [Supported CD features and integrations](/docs/continuous-delivery/cd-integrations).

## Important notes

- Harness supports Go templating with SAM templates and values.yaml files.
- Currently, you cannot add artifacts to your Harness SAM service.
- You can manage whether Harness performs the SAM build within an ephemeral Docker container in a Kubernetes cluster using the `--use-container` option in the Harness SAM Build step. You can manage the Kubernetes settings for these steps as needed. For more information, go to [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/sam-cli-command-reference-sam-build.html#ref-sam-cli-build-options).
- Harness doesn't support a controlled AWS SAM Rollback after a deployment pipeline failure occurs. AWS SAM will deploy the lambda function and if it fails during stack creation, cloudformation will roll it back. After a succesful AWS SAM deployment, Harness is not able to initiate a rollback, due to the AWS SAM cli's limitation to trigger rollback on demand.
- OIDC-enabled AWS connectors are now supported for AWS SAM deployments.

## AWS permissions

When you set up the Harness environment for your deployment, you must add a Harness AWS connector to the Harness environment Infrastructure Definition. Typically, the AWS connector uses the access and secret keys for an AWS IAM user (there are other options). The permissions added to the IAM user account must permit whatever AWS service changes you are performing in your SAM template.

<details>
<summary>Common SAM permissions</summary>

- **IAM role for SAM deployment:** You need an IAM role with the necessary permissions to deploy AWS SAM applications. This role should include permissions for interacting with AWS CloudFormation, AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, and other AWS services your application relies on.
- **CloudFormation permissions:** The IAM role should have permissions to create, update, and delete CloudFormation stacks. This includes permissions for creating and managing CloudFormation templates, stack resources, and stack policy.
- **Lambda function permissions:** The IAM role should have appropriate permissions for creating and managing Lambda functions. This includes permissions for creating, updating, and deleting Lambda functions, as well as permissions for viewing and modifying function configurations, policies, and execution roles.
- **API Gateway permissions:** If your SAM application uses Amazon API Gateway for creating REST APIs, the IAM role should have permissions to manage API Gateway resources. This includes permissions for creating and managing APIs, methods, stages, deployment, and integration configurations.
- **S3 bucket permissions:** If your SAM application requires storing artifacts or deployment packages in Amazon S3, the IAM role should have permissions to read and write to the specific S3 buckets used for storing deployment artifacts.
- **CloudWatch logs permissions:** If your SAM application generates logs that are stored in Amazon CloudWatch Logs, the IAM role should have permissions to create and write logs to the specified log groups.
- **Other service-specific permissions:** Depending on the services your SAM application interacts with (for example, DynamoDB, SNS, SQS, etc.), you may need to include additional permissions specific to those services.

The most common roles for SAM are:

- AWSLambdaFullAccess
- AWSCloudFormationFullAccess
- AmazonS3FullAccess
- AmazonAPIGatewayAdministrator

For more details, go to [Managing resource access and permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/sam-permissions.html) from AWS.

## Containerized step images

#### Old Images

Harness supports different images for Build and Deploy for AWS SAM deployment. 

SAM Build: [`harnessdev/sam-build:1.82.0-latest`](https://hub.docker.com/r/harnessdev/sam-build/tags)

SAM Deploy: [`harnessdev/sam-deploy:1.82.0-latest`](https://hub.docker.com/r/harnessdev/sam-deploy/tags)

:::warning
If you are using Harness SAM build or deploy image, please check the [`harnessdev/sam-build`](https://hub.docker.com/r/harnessdev/sam-build/tags)
and  [`harnessdev/sam-deploy`](https://hub.docker.com/r/harnessdev/sam-deploy/tags) DockerHub repository for the newest one. Be warned, the image bearing the latest tag may not be newest image.
:::


We recommend you to use the new images that we have introduced with multiple runtime support.

#### New Images

Harness support [multiple runtime images](https://hub.docker.com/r/harness/aws-sam-plugin/tags) for **nodejs20**, **nodejs18**, **python3.11**, **python3.12**, **ruby3.2**, **java8**, **go1.24**   and **java17**.. These are Linux AMD64 images. 

Unlike old images, in new images a single image has the capabiliity of handling all the SAM steps.

 Runtimes | Images |
| --- | --- |
| nodejs 20 | harness/aws-sam-plugin:nodejs20.x-1.120.0-1.0.1-beta-linux-amd64 |
| nodejs 18 | harness/aws-sam-plugin:nodejs18.x-1.120.0-1.0.1-beta-linux-amd64 |
| java 17   | harness/aws-sam-plugin:java17-1.120.0-1.0.1-beta-linux-amd64 |

:::important note
These images can only be used in containerized step.

## Use AWS IRSA for Harness AWS connector credentials

The **Use IRSA** option allows you to use a service account with a specific IAM role when making authenticated requests to resources. In order for it work in this case you will need to create a service account in the namespace where the step group will be run that has the releveant IAM role with IRSA. In this case it is the step group pod that makes the relevant API calls and hence needs the IRSA service account setup. 

:::info

The below mentioned configuration has been tested exclusively on clusters created with eksctl, hence if you are creating cluster using some other way like terraform, cloudformation etc. there could be some unknown issues

:::

With this option, you can use AWS [IAM roles for service accounts (IRSA)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html) to associate a specific IAM role with the service account used by the step group pod.

1. Verify your firewall policy and make sure to whitelist all AWS endpoints for the services you're using. For more details, go to [view AWS service endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#view-service-endpoints).
2. Modify your step group YAML, as described below.

<details>
<summary>Configure step group YAML for IRSA</summary>

Setting up IRSA credentials requires a few more steps than other methods, but it is a simple process.

1. Create the IAM role with the policies you want the step group to use. The policies you select depend on what AWS resources you are deploying via the step group.
2. In the cluster namespace wherethe step group will exist, create a service account and attach the IAM role to it.
   Here is an example of how to create a new service account in the cluster where you will install the step group pod and attach the IAM policy to it:

   ```
   eksctl create iamserviceaccount \
       --name=cdp-admin \
       --namespace=deploy-sam-step-group \
       --cluster=test-eks \
       --attach-policy-arn=<policy-arn> \
       --approve \
       --override-existing-serviceaccounts â€”region=us-east-1
   ```
</details>


:::warning

Using AWS IRSA requires additional configuration in the AWS SAM Step Group. See [AWS SAM Step Group](docs/continuous-delivery/deploy-srv-diff-platforms/aws/aws-sam-deployments.md#sam-step-group) below for details.

:::

## AWS SAM service

Harness supports standard SAM templates. You can add your SAM directory in the Harness SAM service.

:::note

For information on general service settings, go to [Services and environments basics](/docs/continuous-delivery/get-started/services-and-environments-overview).

:::

To add your template, do the following:

1. In your Harness project, in **Deployments**, select **Services**.
2. Select **New Service**.
3. Name the service and select **Save**.
4. In **Deployment Type**, select **AWS SAM**.
5. In **Manifests**, select **Add Manifest**.
6. In **Specify Manifest Type**, select **AWS SAM Directory**, and then select **Continue**.
7. In **Specify AWS SAM Directory Store**, choose a provider and follow the corresponding instructions below. You can also use the [Harness File Store](/docs/continuous-delivery/x-platform-cd-features/services/add-inline-manifests-using-file-store).

#### Git Providers
8. Select your Git provider of choice.
9. Select or create a new Harness Git connector to your Git provider, and then select **Continue**.
10. In **Manifest Details**, enter the following:
   1. **Manifest Identifier:** Enter a name for the template.
   2. **Git Fetch Type:** Select how you want to fetch the template.
   3. **Branch**/**Commit Id:** Enter the branch name or commit Id.
   4. **File/Folder Path:** Enter the path to the template from the root of the repository.
11. Select **Submit**.

#### AWS S3
8. Select the AWS S3 provider.
9. Select or create a new Harness AWS connector to your AWS S3 provider, and then select **Continue**.
10. In **Manifest Details**, enter the following:
   1. **Manifest Identifier** Enter a name that identifies this Serverless manifest.
   2. **Region** Select the AWS region to use for the connection.
   3. **Bucket Name** Enter the AWS S3 bucket name.
   4. **File/Folder Path** Enter the path from the root of the bucket to the `serverless.yml` file.
11. Select **Submit**.

:::info
   For an AWS S3 provider, the file path can be a `.zip` file. Harness will automatically decompress the file when it is pulled from the bucket. 
:::

### Values YAML

You can also add a values.yaml file to use Go templating in your SAM template. Go templating allows you to select different values.yaml files for different environments, etc.

Your values.yaml file can use standard Go formatting, like this:

```yaml
runtime: nodejs18.x
```
:::note
By default, the values will be resolved for the manifest in both SAM build and deploy step. If you don't want it to get resolved in each step you can use the environment variable `PLUGIN_RESOLVE_WITH_VALUES_MANIFEST` and set it to `false`.
:::

Your template references the values.yaml file using the format `{{.Values.KEY}}`. Here's an example using `{{.Values.runtime}}`:

```yaml

---
StockCheckerFunction:
  Type: AWS::Serverless::Function # More info about Function Resource: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/sam-resource-function.html
  Properties:
    CodeUri: functions/stock-checker/
    Handler: app.lambdaHandler
    Runtime: { { .Values.runtime } }
    Architectures:
      - x86_64
```

### Variables

You can create service variables, and then use them in the values.yaml file you added.

You simply use a service variable reference as the value:

```yaml
runtime: <+serviceVariables.runtime>
```

You can only use service variable references in the values.yaml file.

For information on how to override service variables at the environment level, go to [Services and environments basics](/docs/continuous-delivery/get-started/services-and-environments-overview).

## AWS SAM environment

:::note

For information on general environment settings, go to [Services and environments basics](/docs/continuous-delivery/get-started/services-and-environments-overview).

:::

To create an environment, do the following:

1. In your Harness project, in **Deployments**, select **Environments**.
2. Select **New Environment**, name the environment, select its **Environment Type**, and then select **Save**.

Next you will add the SAM infrastructure definition.

## Define the infrastructure

The SAM infrastructure definition is the target AWS account and region for the SAM deployment.

1. In the environment, select **Infrastructure Definitions**.
2. Select **Infrastructure Definitions**.
3. Name the infrastructure definition and, in **Deployment Type**, select **AWS SAM**.
4. In **Connector**, select or create a Harness AWS connector. Ensure the IAM account uses the required permissions for the operations your SAM template requires.
5. In **Region**, select the target region.
6. Select **Save**.

When a pipeline stage uses this infrastructure definition, it will deploy your SAM template changes in the target region.

## AWS SAM stage

Now that you have your SAM service and environment, you can create your SAM pipeline.

When you add a Deploy stage to a pipeline, you can select the AWS SAM deployment type.

1. In your Harness project, in **Deployments**, create or open a pipeline.
2. Select **Add Stage**, and then select **Deploy**.
3. Name your stage.
4. In **Deployment Type**, select **AWS SAM**, and then select **Set Up Stage**.
5. In **Service**, select the SAM service to use, and then select **Continue**.
6. In **Environment**, select the SAM environment and infrastructure definition to use, and then select **Continue**.
7. Select the [deployment strategy](/docs/continuous-delivery/manage-deployments/deployment-concepts) to use, and then select **Use Strategy**.

## AWS SAM basic strategy and steps

The basic strategy consists of the following execution setup:

- **SAM step group:** Uses your Kubernetes cluster as a step runtime infrastructure.
  - **DinD Background step:** Creates a Docker in Docker container for the each step's execution resources.
  - **Download Manifests step:** Fetches your SAM template.
  - **SAM Build step:** Runs a [SAM build](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/sam-cli-command-reference-sam-build.html).
  - **SAM Deploy step:** Runs a [SAM deploy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/sam-cli-command-reference-sam-deploy.html).

![AWS SAM basic strategy](static/16e15bb95e3f58e3a28b3a4c0b1c7791ad1f07453fddc859da8400cfd37d7535.png)

These steps are described in detail below.

### SAM step group

Harness automatically generates a containerized step group containing the steps needed for the SAM build and deploy.

When the step group setting **Enable container based execution** is enabled, the step group is containerized. SAM runs on containerized step groups only. You need not install SAM CLI on Harness Delegate as Harness provided SAM step images are baked within the SAM CLI. SAM steps run in the containers that are brought up inside the pod within the Kubernetes cluster configured in the step group configuration. 

When the **Enable container based execution** setting is disabled, Harness Delegate cannot perform the SAM deployment.

You need to configure the following mandatory settings:

- **Kubernetes Cluster:** Add a Harness [Kubernetes Cluster connector](/docs/platform/connectors/cloud-providers/ref-cloud-providers/kubernetes-cluster-connector-settings-reference/) to connect to the cluster that will be used as the runtime step infrastructure.
- **Namespace:** Enter the name of the cluster namespace to use.

:::info
   If you are using AWS IRSA then you will need to add your service account to the step group.
   1. Make sure the **Namespace** of your Containerized Step Group includes the service account bound to a role with IRSA.
   2. In **Optional Configuration** set the **Service Account Name** to the service account bound to a role with IRSA.
:::

### Harness Docker Hub connector and image for all steps

The DinD Background, SAM Build, and SAM Deploy steps are containerized. In each step, you must provide a Harness connector to a container registry and an image for the container the step uses.

When you create the **Execution** section of your stage the first time and select the Basic strategy, Harness supplies the container registry connector and image for each step automatically.

You can add/select a different container registry connector and image for each step, but the image should support the SAM template operations you are deploying.

### DinD Background step

Let's review the SAM deployment's use of the DinD Background step:

1. Open the **dind** Background step. The automatically generated step is named `dind`.
2. In **Container Registry**, the Harness container registry connector is already set up. You can add/select your own container registry connector if you like.
3. In **Image**, you can see the `docker:dind` Docker in Docker image is set up.

   The remaining settings on optional.

:::info note
If you don't want docker to run in background you can set the environment variable `PLUGIN_WAIT_FOR_DOCKER_RUN` to `false` in your SAM steps.
:::


### Download manifests step

The Download Manifests step fetches the SAM template in the Harness service you selected for this stage. This step does not require configuration.

Here's an example of the step tasks:

1. **Git initialization:** The command `git init` is executed to initialize a new Git repository.
2. **Setting remote origin:** The command `git remote add origin <repository-url>` is executed to set the remote origin for the Git repository.
3. **Fetching remote branches:** The command `git fetch --depth=50 origin +refs/heads/main:` is executed to fetch the remote branches from the origin.
4. **Checking out main branch:** The command `git checkout -b main origin/main` is executed to create and switch to a new branch named `main` based on the remote branch `origin/main`.

:::important note
Since it is a containerized step and each step acts like a pod, the path of the directory where your manifest will be downloaded would look like :
`/harness/Manifest identifier/Folder Path`
Suppose your manifest name is m1 in your Service YAML, you can use the following expression:-`<+manifests.m1.identifier>` to access your manifest identifier.
You can access your folder path that you have defined in your Manifest via expression : `<+manifests.m1.store.folderPath>`
:::

### SAM Build step

The SAM Build step performs a standard [SAM build](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/sam-cli-command-reference-sam-build.html) as well as setting up the container environment, resolving expressions in the SAM template, and building the SAM application using the specified dependencies and Docker container image.

To configure the SAM Build step, do the following:

1. Open the SAM Build step.
2. In **Container Registry**, you can see that the Harness Docker Registry connector is already set up.
3. In **Image**, you can use the latest Harness images that support [multiple runtimes](#containerized-step-images). For example: [harness/aws-sam-plugin:nodejs20.x-1.120.0-1.0.0-beta-linux-amd64](https://hub.docker.com/r/harness/aws-sam-plugin/tags). You can use a different image as well as per your need.

#### AWS SAM build command options (required)

The [--use-container](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/sam-cli-command-reference-sam-build.html) option is set up by Harness automatically. This command ensures that AWS SAM packages and builds the application code inside a Docker container that is configured with the necessary dependencies and runtime environment specified in the AWS SAM template.

:::warning

Do not remove this command. It is required for the current beta of this feature. It will be optional in future releases.

:::

### Pre Execution Command

Pre Execution command will run before your actual SAM Build and Deploy step. You can use this field to install any dependencies needed before the plugin logic executes.

![](./static/pre-execution-command.png)

:::warning
Pre Execution command will only run with latest [Harness runtime support images](#containerized-step-images).
:::


#### SAM build docker container registry (required for beta)

In **SAM Build Docker Container Registry**, you can use the same Harness Docker Registry connector automatically set up in the **Container Registry** setting or add/select your own connector.

:::warning

Do not remove this connector. It is required for the current beta of this feature. It will be optional in future releases.

:::

#### Step execution summary

Here's a summary of the step's tasks that you will see in the step log once its run:

1. **Setting up environment:**
   1. Changes the current directory, such as `m1/SAM/sam-nodejs-multi-step`.
   2. The command `docker ps` is executed to check if Docker is running, but no containers are listed.
2. **Exporting variables:**
   1. Several environment variables are set using the `export` command, including `PLUGIN_SAM_TEMPLATE_FILE_PATH`, `PLUGIN_VALUES_YAML_FILE_PATH`, and `PLUGIN_VALUES_YAML_CONTENT`. These variables are exported to be used in subsequent commands.
3. **Resolving expressions in SAM template:**
   1. The command `/opt/harness/client-tools/go-template/v0.4.1/go-template -t template.yaml -f values.yaml -o .` is executed to resolve expressions in the SAM template file based on the values provided in values.yaml.
   2. The resolved SAM template content is displayed in the log before and after expression resolution.
4. **Building SAM application code:**
   1. The command `java -jar /opt/harness/sam-build.jar` is executed to build the SAM application.
   2. The SAM CLI collects telemetry data, and it provides a link to learn more about telemetry.
   3. The Docker container `image public.ecr.aws/sam/build-nodejs18.x:latest-x86_64` is fetched to build the SAM application.
   4. A builder is used to pack, install dependencies, and clean up the environment for each template function.
5. **Build result:**
   1. The build is marked successful, and the built artifacts are located in the `.aws-sam/build` directory.
   2. The built SAM template is located at `.aws-sam/build/template.yaml`.

### SAM Deploy step

The SAM Deploy step performs a standard [SAM deploy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/sam-cli-command-reference-sam-deploy.html).

To configure the SAM Deploy step, do the following:

1. Open the SAM Deploy step.
2. In **Container Registry**, you can see that the Harness Docker Registry connector is already set up.
3. In **Image**, you can use the latest Harness images that support [multiple runtimes](#containerized-step-images). For example: [harness/aws-sam-plugin:nodejs20.x-1.120.0-1.0.0-beta-linux-amd64](https://hub.docker.com/r/harness/aws-sam-plugin/tags). You can use a different image as well as per your need.
4. In Stake Name, enter the name of the CloudFormation stack that will be created or updated as part of the deployment process.


Here's a summary of the step's tasks that you will see in the step log once its run:

1. The `aws configure` authentication steps are executed.
2. The directory is changed to the working directory, such as `m1/SAM/sam-nodejs-multi-step`.
3. The command `docker ps` is executed.
4. The command `java -jar /opt/harness/sam-deploy.jar` is executed.
5. Information about SAM CLI telemetry collection is displayed.
6. Information about the managed S3 bucket is displayed.
7. Details of the deployment are displayed, including stack name, region, and other parameters.
8. The deployment is initiated.
9. The SAM deployment is successful.

## Deploy the pipeline

Now that the pipeline is complete, you can deploy it.

1. Select **Run**, and then select **Run Pipeline** to initiate the deployment.
2. Observe the execution logs as Harness deploys the template and checks for a successful deployment.

In the SAM Deploy step logs, you can see the CloudFormation events from stack operations and CloudFormation outputs from the deployment stack.

If the deployment is successful, you will see:

```
Successfully created/updated stack - STACK_NAME
...
SAM Deploy Successful
```

## FAQs for AWS SAM

**Question:** Where does Harness publish it's images for AWS SAM Build and Deploy?

- We publish these images in Harness' DockerHub Registry for user's to reference in their SAM Build or SAM Deploy Steps
- For SAM Build: https://hub.docker.com/r/harnessdev/sam-build
- For SAM Deploy: https://hub.docker.com/r/harnessdev/sam-deploy/tags

In your Harness Steps, you can update the Container Configuration's Image section with a newer version of the image.

**Question:** How do we debug the SAM Build or SAM Deploy Steps?

Under the AWS SAM Build Command Options, we recommend passing the `--debug` flag. This will help print more verbose errors when troubleshooting failures

```YAML
                    - step:
                        type: AwsSamBuild
                        name: SAM Build
                        identifier: SAM_Build
                        spec:
                          connectorRef: account.harnessImage
                          image: harnessdev/sam-build:1.82.0-latest

                            - "--use-container"
                            - "--debug" ## This field needs to be added.
                            - "--build-image harnessdev/testing:5.6.4" ## This field will need to be added
                          envVariables:
                            PLUGIN_SAM_TEMPLATE_FILE_PATH: <+env.name>_template.yaml
                          runAsUser: root
                          samBuildDockerRegistryConnectorRef: account.harnessImage
                        when:
                          stageStatus: Success
                        timeout: 10m
```

**Question:** What versions of SAM CLI Version are supported by Harness?

- We support SAM CLI Version 1.84.0
- We are working to stay up to date with the latest versions of SAM CLI and making sure it's compatible with newer versions of our steps.

**Question:** Can we fetch Build Images from a Public Repo?

- Yes, Harness can fetch build images from a public repo. Please see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-image-repositories.html for all the Sam Build Image options from the public ECR Repo.

- In the AWS SAM Build Command Options you can pass in an argument like so:

```SH
--build-image public.ecr.aws/sam/build-nodejs18.x:1.100.0-20231031004056
```

In the Step YAML

```YAML
                    - step:
                        type: AwsSamBuild
                        name: SAM Build
                        identifier: SAM_Build

**Question:** Can we fetch Build Images from a Private Repo?

- Yes Harness can fetch your Build Images from a private repo. This will require the user to have the proper permissions configured and the correct user access to the container repo.
- In the SAM Build Step, under the SAM Build Docker Container Registry Section, you can specify the specific image repository you want to fetch your SAM Build Image.

**Question:** How to access the SAM Build Step Outputs?

- SAM build creates a â€œ.aws-sam" directory in the same directory where your template.yml exists.

- By default, Download Manifests Step downloads your repo in `/harness/MANIFEST_IDENTIFIER/` path which should be `/harness/dev/` in this case.
- If you have customized the step and the SAM template.yaml exits in the root level directly, AWS SAM outputs won't be available in the root path. You need to make sure `.aws-sam` should be present `/harness/dev/` path.

**Question:** How do I pass in the SAM Template path as an environment variable?

- Under the Environment Variables section of the step, you can specify a key and value
- For the Key, you can provide `PLUGIN_SAM_TEMPLATE_FILE_PATH` and the value can be a `fixed`, `expression` input.

```YAML
                    - step:
                        type: AwsSamBuild
                        name: SAM Build
                        identifier: SAM_Build
