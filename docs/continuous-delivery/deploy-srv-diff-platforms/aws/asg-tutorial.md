This topic explains how to deploy new AWS Auto Scale Groups (ASGs) and instances to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) using Harness.

## Deployment summary

Here's a high-level summary of the setup steps and how Harness deploys ASGs.

<details>
<summary>Harness setup summary</summary>

Here's a summary of how you set up ASG deployments in Harness:

1. Create the Harness ASG service.
   1. Add launch template.
   2. Add ASG configuration.
   3. Add scaling policies (optional).
   4. Add scheduled update group action (optional).
   5. Add the AMI image to use for the ASG as an artifact.
2. Create the Harness ASG environment.
   1. Connect Harness to the AWS region where you want to deploy.
3. Define the Harness ASG pipeline execution.
   1. Select a deployment strategy (rolling, canary, blue green) and Harness automatically creates the steps to deploy the new ASG.
4. Deploy the Harness pipeline.

</details>


<details>
<summary>Deployment summary</summary>

Here's a summary of how Harness deploys new ASG versions:

1. First deployment:
   1. Harness takes the launch template and ASG configuration files you provide and creates a new ASG and its instances in your AWS account and region.
2. Subsequent deployments:
   1. Harness creates a new version of the launch template.
   2. Harness uses the new version of the launch template to update the ASG. For example, if you increased the desired capacity (`desiredCapacity`) for the ASG in your ASG configuration file, Harness will create a new version of the ASG with the new desired capacity.
   3. Instance refresh is triggered (a rolling replacement of all or some instances in the ASG).

Notes:
- ASG creation differs for rolling and blue green deployments:
  - For rolling, Harness updates the *existing* ASG with the new configuration.
  - For blue green, Harness creates a *new* ASG with a new revision suffix, like `asg-demo__2`. Once there are two ASGs (`asg-demo__1` and `asg-demo__2`) Harness alternately updates these *existing* ASGs with the new configuration on each successive deployment.

## AWS policy requirements

When you set up a Harness AWS connector to connect Harness with your AWS account, the AWS IAM role must have the following policies.

<details>
<summary>AmazonEC2FullAccess</summary>

- **Policy Name:** [AmazonEC2FullAccess](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonEC2FullAccess).
- **Policy ARN:** arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonEC2FullAccess.
- **Description:** Provides full access to Amazon EC2 via the AWS Management Console.

Policy JSON:

```json
{  
  "Version": "2012-10-17",  
  "Statement": [  
    {  
      "Action": "ec2:*",  
      "Effect": "Allow",  
      "Resource": "*"  
    },  
    {  
      "Effect": "Allow",  
      "Action": "elasticloadbalancing:*",  
      "Resource": "*"  
    },  
    {  
      "Effect": "Allow",  
      "Action": "cloudwatch:*",  
      "Resource": "*"  
    },  
    {  
      "Effect": "Allow",  
      "Action": "autoscaling:*",  
      "Resource": "*"  
    }  
  ]  
}  
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>DescribeRegions</summary>

:::note

The [DescribeRegions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeRegions.html) action is required for all AWS IAM roles used in Harness AWS connectors regardless of what AWS service you are using.

:::

Harness needs a policy with the `DescribeRegions` action so that it can list the available regions for you when you define your target architecture.

Create a [Customer Managed Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html#customer-managed-policies), add the `DescribeRegions` action to list those regions, and add that to any role used by the Cloud Provider.

```json
{  
    "Version": "2012-10-17",  
    "Statement": [  
        {  
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",  
            "Effect": "Allow",  
            "Action": "ec2:DescribeRegions",  
            "Resource": "*"  
        }  
    ]  
}
```

</details>


## Harness ASG services

The Harness ASG service contains the following:

- Launch template.
- ASG configuration file.
- Scaling policies (optional).
- Scheduled update group action (optional).
- The AMI image to use for the ASG.

Harness supports standard ASG JSON formatted files. For more information, go to [Get started with Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/get-started-with-ec2-auto-scaling.html) from AWS.

You can use remote files stored in a Git repo or the [Harness File Store](/docs/continuous-delivery/x-platform-cd-features/services/add-inline-manifests-using-file-store).

:::note

You can create a service when you are building the pipeline or separately in **Services**. In this topic, we walk through building the service separately. For more information, go to [CD pipeline modeling overview](/docs/continuous-delivery/get-started/cd-pipeline-modeling-overview).

To configure a Harness ASG service in the Harness Manager, do the following:

1. In your project, in CD (Deployments), select **Services**.
2. Select **Manage Services**, and then select **New Service**.
3. Enter a name for the service and select **Save**.
4. Select **Configuration**.
5. In **Service Definition**, select **AWS Auto Scaling Group**.
6. In **AWS ASG Configurations**, enter the following configuration files. 
  Only **Launch Template** and **ASG Configuration** are required.
   1. [Launch template](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/create-launch-template.html). Enter a standard AWS JSON or YAML formatted launch template. 
   2. In **ASG Configuration**, add a [ASG configuration file](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/tutorials-auto-scaling-group-create-auto-scaling-group.html#tutorials-auto-scaling-group-create-auto-scaling-group-cli).
   3. [Scaling policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/examples-scaling-policies.html). This is optional.
   
   This is the same as the **Automatic scaling** option in the ASG console setup:

   ![Automatic scaling option in the ASG console setup](./static/ae598a44899643397e7ee9502a8fc6698bd8703bff7209fe7a4c95c4b82c3704.png)  

   1. [Scheduled update group action](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-scheduled-scaling.html). This is optional.
   
   This is the same as the scheduled action in the ASG console setup:
   
   ![Edit scheduled action](./static/5cfdb08c486ac86332089f793e1dbc0b011e1730c595d18e937370f6ca1587fc.png)  
   
   Next, in **Artifacts**, you add the private AMI image to use for the ASG instances.
7. In **Artifacts**, select **Add Artifact Source**.
8. In **Specify Artifact Repository Type**, select **Amazon Machine Image**, and select **Continue**.
9. In **Amazon Machine Image Repository**, in **AWS Connector**, select or create a Harness AWS connector, and then select **Continue**. Review [AWS policy requirements](#aws-policy-requirements) to ensure that the AWS credentials you provide are adequate.
10. In **Artifact Details**, enter a name to identify this AMI artifact in Harness.
11. In **Region**, select the region where the ASG is located.
12. In **AMI Tags**, add any AWS Tags that you are using to identify your AMI. For details on these key/value pairs, go to [Tagging Your Amazon EC2 Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.html) from AWS.
13. In **AMI Filters**, add AMI filters to locate the AMI resource. These are key/value pairs that identify the AMI Id. This must be a private AMI.
14. In **Version Details** and **Version**, specify the AMI version to use.
15. Select **Submit**.
16. Select **Save** to save the service.
    
    The Harness ASG service is complete. You can now use it in your Harness ASG pipelines.

### ASG configuration files

AWS does not have a dedicated public resource for ASG configuration file formatting because ASG creation is typically done using the AWS CLI, SDKs, or Management Console, which have their own syntax and methods for specifying the parameters.

However, the AWS CLI [create-auto-scaling-group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/autoscaling/create-auto-scaling-group.html) command reference documentation provides a detailed description of the parameters that can be used when creating an ASG. 

<details>
<summary>ASG configuration file example</summary>

```json
{
  "AutoScalingGroupName": "my-asg",
  "MinSize": 1,
  "MaxSize": 3,
  "DesiredCapacity": 2,
  "AvailabilityZones": ["us-west-2a", "us-west-2b"],
  "LaunchTemplate": {
    "LaunchTemplateId": "lt-0123456789abcdef0",
    "Version": "1"
  },
  "VPCZoneIdentifier": "subnet-0123456789abcdef0,subnet-0123456789abcdef1",
  "HealthCheckType": "EC2",
  "HealthCheckGracePeriod": 300,
  "Tags": [
    {
      "Key": "Environment",
      "Value": "Development",
      "PropagateAtLaunch": true
    }
  ]
}
```
</details>


### AMI artifacts

Review the following information about the AMI artifacts you select in your ASG service.

#### Only private AMIs are supported

When you add an AMI artifact you must use a private AMI. Public AMIs from the AMI Catalog are not supported at this time.

In the AWS console, in EC2, private AMIs are listed in **Images** > **AMIs**.

#### Artifact AMI overrides config files AMIs

You can specify an AMI in the launch template used in the Harness service, but it will be overridden by the AMI specified in the Harness service **Artifacts** section.

The AMI specified in the Harness service **Artifacts** section is the same as selecting an AMI in the **Create launch template** wizard in the AWS console or `ImageId` in in the [create-launch-template](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/create-launch-template.html) CLI command.  

### Using service variables in config file

Service variables are a powerful way to template your services or make them more dynamic.

In the **Variables** section of the service, you can add service variables and then reference them in any of the ASG configuration files you added to the service.

For example, you could create a variable named **desiredCapacity** and set its value as a [fixed value, runtime input, or expression](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/references/runtime-inputs/).

![service variable](./static/c590ccda5addd62225b690d85c60237b2f6e9378e8ed4b02ba3e82ba9bda29e9.png)  

Next, in your ASG configuration file, you could reference the variable like this (see `<+serviceVariables.desiredCapacity>`):

```json
{
  "autoScalingGroupName": "lovish2-asg",
  "minSize": 1,
  "maxSize": 3,
  "desiredCapacity": <+serviceVariables.desiredCapacity>,
  "tags": [{"key": "key7", "value":  "value7"}, {"key": "key2", "value":  "value2"}],
  "availabilityZones": ["us-east-1a", "us-east-1b"]
}
```

Now, when you add that service to a pipeline, you will be prompted to enter a value for this variable in the pipeline **Services** tab. The value you provide is then used as the `desiredCapacity` in your ASG configuration.

## Harness ASG environments

The Harness ASG environment is where you specify production and non-production environment settings. 

You also add a infrastructure definition to define the region where you want to deploy the ASG.

:::note

You can create an environment when you are building the pipeline or separately in **Environments**. In this topic, we walk through building the environment separately. For more information, go to [CD pipeline modeling overview](/docs/continuous-delivery/get-started/cd-pipeline-modeling-overview).

For the Terraform Provider resource, go to [harness_platform_environment](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/harness/harness/latest/docs/resources/platform_environment) and [harness_platform_environment_service_overrides](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/harness/harness/latest/docs/resources/platform_environment_service_overrides).

Here's an example of harness_platform_environment: 

```yaml
resource "harness_platform_environment" "example" {
  identifier = "ASG"
  name       = "ASG"
  org_id     = "default"
  project_id = "myproject"
  tags       = ["foo:bar", "baz"]
  type       = "PreProduction"

  ## ENVIRONMENT V2 Update
  ## The YAML is needed if you want to define the Environment Variables and Overrides for the environment
  ## Not Mandatory for Environment Creation nor Pipeline Usage

  yaml = <<-EOT
               environment:
                  name: ASG
                  identifier: ASG
                  description: ""
                  tags: {}
                  type: Production
                  orgIdentifier: default

      EOT
}
```

```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem3>
  <TabItem3 value="Harness Manager" label="Harness Manager">
```

To create an environment, do the following:

1. In your project, in CD (Deployments), select **Environments**.
2. Select **New Environment**.
3. Enter a name for the new environment.
4. In **Environment Type**, select **Production** or **Pre-Production**.
   The **Production** or **Pre-Production** settings can be used in [Harness RBAC](/docs/platform/role-based-access-control/rbac-in-harness/) to restrict who can deploy to these environments.
5. Select **Save**. The new environment is created.

Pipelines require that an environment have an infrastructure definition. We'll cover that next.

```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem3>
</Tabs3>
```

### Infrastructure definition

To define the target ASG region, you add an infrastructure definition to a Harness environment. The infrastructure definition uses a Harness AWS connector and a region setting to define the deployment target.

You can use the same AWS connector you used when adding the AMI artifact in the Harness service. Ensure the AWS IAM user in the AWS connector credentials meets the [AWS policy requirements](#aws-policy-requirements).

```mdx-code-block
import Tabs1 from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem1 from '@theme/TabItem';
```
```mdx-code-block
<Tabs1>
  <TabItem1 value="YAML" label="YAML" default>
```

Here's a YAML example of an ASG infrastructure definition.

```yaml
infrastructureDefinition:
  name: asg-infra
  identifier: asginfra
  description: ""
  tags: {}
  orgIdentifier: default
  projectIdentifier: DoNotDelete_IvanBalan
  environmentRef: ASG
  deploymentType: Asg
  type: Asg
  spec:
    connectorRef: AWS_ASG_CONNECTOR
    region: us-east-1
  allowSimultaneousDeployments: false
```

```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem1>
  <TabItem1 value="API" label="API">

To create the ASG infrastructure definition in an environment, do the following:

1. In your project, in CD (Deployments), select **Environments**.
2. Select the environment where you want to add the infrastructure definition.
3. In the environment, select **Infrastructure Definitions**.
4. Select **Infrastructure Definition**.
5. In **Create New Infrastructure**, in **Name**, enter a name for the new infrastructure definition.
6. In **Deployment Type**, select **AWS Auto Scaling Group**.
7. In **AWS Details**, in Connector, select or create a Harness AWS connector that connects Harness with the account where you want the ASG deployed.
   
   You can use the same AWS connector you used when adding the AMI artifact in the Harness service. Ensure the AWS IAM user in the AWS connector credentials meets the [AWS policy requirements](#aws-policy-requirements).
8. In **Region**, select the AWS region where you want the ASG deployed.
9. Select **Save**.

The infrastructure definition is added.

## Harness ASG pipelines

Once you have a the service and environment created, you can create the pipeline.

:::note

You can create a service and environment when you are building the pipeline or separately in **Services** and **Environments**. In this topic, we walk through building these separately. For more information, go to [CD pipeline modeling overview](/docs/continuous-delivery/get-started/cd-pipeline-modeling-overview).

:::

The pipeline models the release process using execution steps, triggers, and other settings. For more information, go to [CD pipeline modeling overview](/docs/continuous-delivery/get-started/cd-pipeline-modeling-overview).

2. Select **Create a Pipeline**.
3. Enter a name for the pipeline and select **Start**.
4. Select **Add Stage**, and then select **Deploy**.
5. Enter a name for the stage.
6. In **Deployment Type**, select **AWS Auto Scaling Group**, and then select **Set Up Stage**.
7. In **Service**, select the service you created earlier, and then select **Continue**.
8. In **Environment**, select the environment you created earlier.
9. In **Specify Infrastructure**, select the infrastructure definition you created earlier, and then select **Continue**.
10. In **Execution Strategies**, select the execution strategy for your deployment, and then select **Use Strategy**.
    
    The steps for the deployment are generated automatically by Harness. You can add any additional steps you want by selecting **Add Step**.

    In **Rollback**, you can see the rollback steps.
11. Select **Save**. The pipeline is saved.

```

## ASG pipeline execution strategies

Harness ASG deployments support the following [deployment strategies](/docs/continuous-delivery/manage-deployments/deployment-concepts):

- Rolling
- Canary
- Blue Green

### Rolling

The first ASG rolling deployment will deploy a new ASG with the number of desired instances you have defined in your ASG configuration file in the Harness service used in the pipeline. Any other configuration files in the service are also applied.

Subsequent deployments will deploy a new version of the same ASG with any changes you have made in the Harness service configuration files (launch template, ASG configuration, etc.). This is the same as using the **Edit** buttons in the AWS console and creating a new version of the ASG.

Here's a flowchart that explains how Harness performs rolling deployments:

import TabItem4 from '@theme/TabItem';
```
```mdx-code-block
<Tabs4>
  <TabItem4 value="Rolling Deploy step" label="Rolling Deploy step">
```

The Rolling Deploy step has the following options:

- **Same as already running Instances**
  - Enable this setting to use the scaling settings on the last ASG version deployed.
- **Minimum Healthy Percentage (optional)**
  - The percentage of the desired capacity of the ASG that must pass the group's health checks before the refresh can continue. For more information about these health checks, go to [Health checks for Auto Scaling instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-health-checks.html) from AWS.
- **Instance Warmup (optional)**
  - Go to [Set the default instance warmup for an Auto Scaling group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-default-instance-warmup.html?icmpid=docs_ec2as_help_panel) from AWS.
- **Skip Matching**
  - Choose whether AWS Auto Scaling skips replacing instances that match the desired configuration. If no desired configuration is specified, then it skips replacing instances that have the same launch template and instance types that the ASG was using before the instance refresh started. For more information, go to [Use an instance refresh with skip matching](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/asg-instance-refresh-skip-matching.html) from AWS.

If deployment failure occurs, the stage or step [failure strategy](/docs/platform/Pipelines/define-a-failure-strategy-on-stages-and-steps) is initiated. Typically, this runs the Rolling Rollback step in the **Rollback** section of **Execution**.

During rollback of the first deployment, Harness deletes the ASG.

During rollback of subsequent deployments, Harness reverts the ASG to the previous state of ASG before deployment.

Harness stores configurations of the ASG you are deploying twice: 
- First storage: Harness stores the ASG configuration at the start of deployment for rollback *during deployment*.
- Second storage: Harness stores the ASG configuration at the end of deployment for rollbacks *post deployment*.

### Canary

The ASG canary deployment uses two step groups:

1. Canary Deployment:
   1. **ASG Canary Deploy step:** deploys a new ASG version with the name of your ASG and the extension `__Canary`. The canary ASG version can use the `desiredCapacity` in your ASG configuration file or you can set it in the **Instances** setting in the ASG Canary Deploy step.
   2. **ASG Canary Delete step:** deletes the canary ASG.
2. Primary Deployment:
   1. **ASG Rolling Deploy step:**
      1. The first deployment will deploy a new ASG with the number of desired instances you have defined in your ASG configuration file in the Harness service used in the pipeline. Any other configuration files in the service are also applied.
      2. Subsequent deployments will deploy a new *version* of the same ASG with any changes you have made in the Harness service configuration files (launch template, ASG configuration, etc.). This is the same as using the **Edit** buttons in the AWS console and creating a new version of the ASG.

Here's what the two step groups look like:

```

The ASG Canary Deploy step deploys a new ASG with the name of your ASG and the extension `__Canary`. 

In the ASG Canary Deploy step, in **Instances**, you can specify how many instances to use in this temporary ASG. 

The **Instances** replaces the `desiredCapacity` in your ASG configuration file.

If deployment failure occurs, the stage or step [failure strategy](/docs/platform/Pipelines/define-a-failure-strategy-on-stages-and-steps) is initiated. Typically, this runs the rollback steps in the **Rollback** section of **Execution**.

For ASG canary deployments there are two rollback steps:

- **ASG Canary Delete:** deletes the canary ASG (`[app_name]__canary`). 
- **ASG Rolling Rollback:** deletes the new state and returns state to the previous ASG version.

### Blue Green

An ASG Blue Green deployment uses two steps:

1. **ASG Blue Green Deploy step:**
   1. You specify the production and stage listener ports and rules to use.
   2. The new ASG is deployed to the stage target group.
2. **ASG Blue Green Swap Services step:**
   1. Harness modifies the ELB prod listener to forward requests to target groups associated with each new ASG version. 
   2. Harness swaps all traffic from stage to production listeners and ports. 
   3. Harness modifies the ELB stage listener to forward requests to target groups associated with old ASG version. 

The first ASG deployed is given a suffix using the format `[app_name]__1`, like `asgdemo__1`. The second ASG deployed is given the suffix `[app_name]__2`. 

Every subsequent deployment will simply create new versions of these ASGs instead of creating new ASGs. So the third deployment will create a new *version* of ASG `[app_name]__1`, route prod traffic to it, and route stage traffic to ASG `[app_name]__2`.

<details>
<summary>Blue/Green with Traffic Shift Summary</summary>

In this strategy, you specify production and stage listener ports and rules to use in the ASG Blue Green Deploy step. Next, the ASG Swap Services step swaps all traffic from stage to production.

A Blue/Green deployment reliably deploys your ASGs by maintaining new and old versions of ASGs. The ASGs run behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB) using two listeners, stage and prod. These listeners forward respectively to two target groups, stage and prod, where the new and old ASGs are run.

In the first stage of deployment, the new ASG is attached to the stage target group:

![first stage](./static/ea87f58fb9e638f26d1c0a7cefde20158f4ad3c88496b3de827121992dd0ba0a.png)  

Blue/Green deployments are achieved by swapping routes between the target groups—always attaching the new ASG first to the stage target group, and then to the prod target group:

</details>

Here's a flowchart that explains how Harness performs Blue Green deployments:

</details>


<details>
<summary>AWS requirements</summary>

In addition to the requirements of the Harness ASG service and environment, an ASG Blue Green deployment requires you to set up the following resources up within AWS:

- A security group that allows inbound access to your Application Load Balancer's listener ports.
- A pair of target groups—typically staging (Stage) and production (Prod)—both with the instance target type.
- An Application Load Balancer (ALB), with listeners for both your target groups' ports.

</details>

Let's take a look at the first two deployments.

<details>
<summary>First Blue Green deployment</summary>

The first Blue Green deployment follows these steps:

1. ASG Blue Green Deploy step:
   1. Checks that listener ARN and listener rule ARN for prod are valid.
   2. Fetches target group ARNs for prod.
   3. Checks that listener ARN and listener rule ARN for stage are valid.
   4. Fetches target group ARNs for stage.
   5. Creates launch template and ASG using the format `[app_name]__1`, like `asgdemo__1`.
   6. Sets the tag `BG_VERSION=BLUE` on new ASG.
2. ASG Blue Green Swap step:
   1. Not used as there is only one ASG at this point.

</details>


<details>
<summary>Second Blue Green deployment</summary>

At the start, the second Blue Green deployment will only have one prod ASG (the one deployed in the first Blue Green deployment). 

Harness will create a new ASG with the suffix `__2` and swap prod traffic to it. 

The second Blue Green deployment follows these steps:

1. ASG Blue Green Deploy step:
   1. Checks that listener ARN and listener rule ARN for prod are valid.
   2. Fetches target group ARNs for prod.
   3. Checks that listener ARN and listener rule ARN for stage are valid.
   4. Fetches target group ARNs for stage.
   5. Creates launch template and new ASG using the format `[app_name]__2`, like `asgdemo__2`.
   6. Sets the tag `BG_VERSION=GREEN` on new ASG, for example, `asgdemo__2`.
2. ASG Blue Green Swap step swaps target groups and updates tags:
   1. Modifies the ELB prod listener to forward requests to target groups associated with new autoscaling group.
   2. Modifies the ELB stage listener to forward requests to target groups associated with the old autoscaling group.
   3. Updates tags of the autoscaling groups.

Now there are two ASGs being used: a prod and a stage ASG. Subsequent deployments will create a new *versions* of these ASGs and swap prod traffic to the new ASG version from the previous ASG.

import TabItem6 from '@theme/TabItem';
```
```mdx-code-block
<Tabs6>
  <TabItem6 value="ASG Blue Green Deploy step" label="ASG Blue Green Deploy step" default>
```

The ASG Blue Green Deploy step has the following settings:

- **Load Balancer:** select the load balancer to use.
- **Prod Listener:** select the listener to use for prod traffic.
- **Prod Listener Rule ARN (optional):** select the ARN for the prod listener rule.
- **Stage Listener:** select the listener to use for stage traffic.
- **Stage Listener Rule ARN (optional):** select the ARN for the stage listener rule.

Harness fetches these AWS settings using the Harness AWS connector you have set up in the **Infrastructure Definition** in the **Environment** section of the stage.

```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem6>
  <TabItem6 value="ASG Blue Green Swap Services step" label="ASG Blue Green Swap Services step">
```

The ASG Blue Green Swap Services step has the following settings:

- **Downsize old ASG:** select this option to downsize the ASG that Harness swapped the traffic *from*. 
  
  For example, if there was an existing ASG named `asgdemo__1` and you deployed a new version of the ASG named `asgdemo__2` and swapped traffic to it, selecting **Downsize old ASG** will downsize `asgdemo__1`.

```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem6>
  <TabItem6 value="ASG Blue Green Rollback step" label="ASG Blue Green Rollback step">
```

The ASG Blue Green Rollback rolls back the routes and ASG created/updated in the Blue Green deployment.

Harness stores configurations of the ASG you are deploying twice: 
- First storage: Harness stores the ASG configuration at the start of deployment for rollback *during deployment*.
- Second storage: Harness stores the ASG configuration at the end of deployment for rollbacks *post deployment*.

## Notes

AWS has the following limitations to keep in mind:

- You are limited to creating 5000 launch templates per region and 10000 versions per launch template. For more information, go to [Launch an instance from a launch template](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-launch-templates.html) from AWS. 
- ASGs per region: 500.
- Launch configurations per region: 200.
