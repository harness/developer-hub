This topic describes the configuration and settings for the Helm Rollback step.

The Helm Rollback step performs a rolling rollback for a helm deployment. 

As a best practice, every time you use a [Helm Deployment step](/docs/continuous-delivery/deploy-srv-diff-platforms/helm/step-reference/helm-deploy.md) you should also use a Helm Rollback step in the rollback phase of the pipeline. 

## Name

The name for the rollback step.

## Timeout

Enter a timeout for this step. You can use: 
- `w` for weeks
- `d` for days
- `h` for hours
- `m` for minutes
- `s` for seconds
- `ms` for milliseconds

## Skip Steady State Check

By default, Harness checks to see if a deployed workload has reached steady state.

If you select this option, Harness will not check that the workload has reached steady state.

## Optional Configuration

Add any environment variables here.
