This topic describes the configuration and settings for the Helm Deploy step.

The Helm Deploy step performs a rolling deployment strategy. 

## Name

The name for the deploy step.

## Timeout

Enter a timeout for this step. You can use: 
- `w` for weeks
- `d` for days
- `h` for hours
- `m` for minutes
- `s` for seconds
- `ms` for milliseconds

## Ignore Release History Failed Status

By default, if the latest Helm release failed, Harness does not proceed with the install/upgrade and throws an error.

Enable this option to have Harness ignore these errors and proceed with install/upgrade.

## Skip Steady State Check

By default, Harness checks to see if a deployed workload has reached steady state.

If you select this option, Harness will not check that the workload has reached steady state.

## Optional Configuration

Add any environment variables here.
