A Tanzu Application Service (TAS) service and environment are used together when you set up a pipeline to deploy your TAS app. You can configure your environment to override settings of the Harness TAS services that use the environment, thereby making the environment dictate TAS manifests, variables, and config file values.

For example, a TAS service uses a `manifest.yaml` file that specifies specific routes, but an environment might need to change the routes because it is deploying the app in the manifest to a QA space.
