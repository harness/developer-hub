Diagnostics helps you validate data accuracy, monitor data ingestion, and troubleshoot integration related issues in the application. It provides visibility into data ingestion status, progress, and alerts to ensure the SEI system is healthy and  has the latest data updated.

## Primary scenarios

Use SEI Diagnostics if you need to:

* Compare data between Jira or supported SCM tools and SEI and verify the accuracy and completeness of ingested data
* Track real-time status of all integrations and view the summary of data ingested from each source.
* Identify and resolve integration misconfigurations
* Investigate missing tickets, commits, or pull request data in SEI reports
* Monitor status and progress of data ingestion jobs
* Receive alerts for anomalies or issues in the ingestion process

:::info Supported Integrations:

* Issue Management: Jira by Atlassian
* Source Control Management (SCM): All SCM integrations supported by SEI
