This guide explains what you need to know to get started using Harness SEI 2.0.

## Complete Harness Platform onboarding

If you're new to Harness, review the [Harness Platform onboarding guide](/docs/platform/get-started/onboarding-guide) and [Harness Platform key concepts](/docs/platform/get-started/key-concepts) before onboarding to SEI 2.0.

## SEI 1.0 and SEI 2.0

If you're switching over to Harness SEI 2.0 from the SEI 1.0 experience, review the [SEI 1.0 vs SEI 2.0 Guide](/docs/software-engineering-insights/harness-sei/sei-overview.md) for useful information about what's new in the SEI 2.0 experience.
