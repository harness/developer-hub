Productivity in SEI 2.0 focuses on understanding the actual work being delivered by developers, the quality of that work, and how effectively teams collaborate to get it done.

Rather than measuring activity for its own sake, we aim to surface signals that reflect meaningful engineering output and work that drives value.

We’ve designed this experience to focus on the quality, velocity, and collaboration behind the code. Whether you're tracking individual contributions or team-wide trends, SEI 2.0 helps you see where work is flowing smoothly and where it might be getting stuck.

We break productivity down into three core dimensions:

* **Volume:** How much work is getting done? think commits, pull requests, stories moved forward, and overall code activity.
* **Output:** What that work actually delivers—whether it’s shipping to production, creating customer value, or leading to rework down the line.
* **Collaboration:** How effectively teams are working together? review quality, responsiveness, cross-functional interaction, and shared ownership.
