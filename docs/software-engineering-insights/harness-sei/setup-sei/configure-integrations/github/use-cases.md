:::warning Breaking Change (Effective October 7, 2025)
Due to a change in the GitHub Events API, Harness SEI can no longer ingest commits that are not associated with a pull request (PR). Only PR-linked commits are currently ingested and displayed in Harness SEI.

For more information about impacted metrics and widgets, see [GitHub Commit Ingestion Breaking Change](/docs/software-engineering-insights/harness-sei/setup-sei/configure-integrations/github/commit-ingestion).
