## Overview

Once an [Org Tree](../setup-org-tree) is set up, you can view high-level insights such as [Efficiency](../../analytics-and-reporting/efficiency), [Productivity](../../analytics-and-reporting/productivity), and [Business Alignment](../../analytics-and-reporting/business-alignment) for the entire organization.

## Viewing insights at the organization tree level

To view insights at the organization tree level:

1. From the left-hand navigation pane, click on **Insights**.
1. From the dropdown menu (e.g., "SEI org tree v7 July"), select the Org Tree you want to view insights for.
1. Review the DORA metrics displayed, such as "Lead Time for Changes," "Deployment Frequency," "Change Failure Rate," and "Mean Time to Restore".

You can interact with the graphs to see breakdowns by stages (Planning, Coding, Review, Build, or Deployment).
