Jira is a proprietary issue-tracking product that allows bug tracking and agile project management. You can connect Harness SEI to Jira using a Harness Jira integration.

### Authenticate with Jira

Before you configure the SEI Jira integration, you must generate an Atlassian API token.

:::tip Use a service account

The user creating the token must have read access to all projects that you want SEI to track, and the user must be able to search issues within the SEI-relevant projects.

Due to the scope of visibility required, consider using a managed service account, rather than a personal user account, to create the token.

:::

1. Create an Atlassian API token. For instructions, go to the Atlassian documentation on [Managing API tokens for your Atlassian account](https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-account/docs/manage-api-tokens-for-your-atlassian-account/).
2. Make sure to copy the token somewhere that you can retrieve it when you configure the integration.

:::info
If you have enabled an allow list in your Atlassian account, certain Harness IP addresses must be added to it in order to allow communication between the Harness Platform and Atlassian. If the necessary IPs are not whitelisted, the integration may fail to authenticate or sync data properly.

To ensure your integration can work correctly, please refer to the list of [Harness Platform IPs](/docs/platform/references/allowlist-harness-domains-and-ips) that may need to be whitelisted in your firewall.

### Add the Jira integration

To integrate SEI with Jira, you must choose your Jira type:

* [Jira Cloud](#add-the-jira-integration)
* [Jira Data Center](/docs/software-engineering-insights/setup-sei/configure-integrations/jira/jira-data-center)

![](../static/jira-types.png)

For the Jira type as Cloud, you can choose how you want to connect Jira i.e.

* Jira Connect App
* Jira API Token

![](../static/jira-cloud-type.png)

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="jira-connect-app" label="Using Jira Connect App" default>

The Jira Connect App facilitates a seamless connection to Jira projects with minimal user intervention, requiring Jira admin configuration for the app.
<br/> <br/>Using the Jira Connect App allows you to retrieve all user emails from Jira, making it faster and easier to connect and manage the integration.

The following permissions are required to configure the **Jira Connect App** integration:

* **View email addresses of users:** This permission allows the integration to access and view the email addresses of users within the Atlassian account.
* **Read data from the application:** This permission allows the integration to read data from the Atlassian account, such as data from Jira tickets, Jira projects etc.
