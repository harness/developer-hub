This topic outlines the steps to update and manage the versions of the Ingestion Satellite using Docker and Kubernetes.

## Update the Satellite

Use these commands if you need to update the Ingestion Satellite version.


<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Docker" label="Docker" default>


```bash
# Pull latest version
docker pull levelops/ingestion-satellite

# List containers and find the current satellite ID
docker container ls

# Stop and remove the old container. Replace <ID> accordingly.
docker container stop <ID>
docker rm <ID>>

# Run the container again. It uses the latest version. Replace the local path accordingly.
docker run -v   /local/path/to/satellite.yml:/levelops/config.yml   -d levelops/ingestion-satellite
```

If you aren't able to execute the `docker pull` command, you can manually [download the Ingestion Satellite image](https://hub.docker.com/r/levelops/ingestion-satellite) from Docker Hub and install it.


</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="k8s" label="Kubernetes">


```bash
# Find the name of the satellite deployment.
kubectl get deployments

# Restart the satellite deployment.
kubectl rollout restart deployment <deployment-name>
```

If you didn't change the default values in the template, the `deployment-name` is `levelops-satellite`, and you can use the following `restart` command:

```bash
kubectl rollout restart deployment levelops-satellite
```


</TabItem>
</Tabs>


Keeping the Ingestion Satellite up-to-date ensures that you benefit from the latest features, improvements, and security patches.
