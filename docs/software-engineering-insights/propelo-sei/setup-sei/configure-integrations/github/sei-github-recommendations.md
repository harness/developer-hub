:::info GitHub Commit Ingestion Update (Resolved)
A GitHub Events API change temporarily impacted ingestion of non-PR commits in Harness SEI.

The issue has been resolved, and missing commits have been backfilled for all healthy, non-satellite integrations. Some integrations may require token updates before backfill can complete.

For details, see [GitHub Commit Ingestion Update](/docs/software-engineering-insights/harness-sei/setup-sei/configure-integrations/github/commit-ingestion).
