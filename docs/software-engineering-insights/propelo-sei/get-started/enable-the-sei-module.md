Harness SEI is currently available to a limited set of customers. To get started, send an email to [support@harness.io](mailto:support@harness.io) for a demo and a Harness specialist will get you going.

To enable Harness Software Engineering Insights (SEI):
* Request activation of the SEI_ENABLED feature flag for your account
* Specify your account details and any relevant information

Once Harness SEI is enabled in your account, an account administrator can help you configure your integrations and create the required Insights.

If the module is enabled and you are an account administrator, go to [SEI Onboarding Guide](/docs/software-engineering-insights/get-started/sei-onboarding-guide).

:::info
Note that if you're already using other Harness modules and you want to start using SEI, you should switch to the New Nav 2.0 experience. However, keep in mind that you won't be able to use both the legacy and new Nav 2.0 experiences simultaneously.
