Use alignment metrics to analyze how engineering teams invest their efforts and align with business needs and strategic initiatives.

Alignment metrics widgets help you:

* Pinpoint wasteful unplanned work, maximize engineering ROI, and reduce waste.
* Measure PM-Engineering collaboration, eliminate back and forth, and endeavor to _build it right the first time_.
* Evaluate offshore, outsourced, and vendor decisions, and quantify these contributions to determine the best options.
* Maximize software cost capitalization by automatically determining software development time for accounting reports.

:::tip

Alignment metrics are driven by [Investment profiles](../sei-profiles/investment-profile.md).

Use [Business Alignment Insights](./sei-insights.md#create-a-business-alignment-insights) to observe these metrics.
