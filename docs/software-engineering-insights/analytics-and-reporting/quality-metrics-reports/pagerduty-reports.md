PagerDuty is an incident response platform for IT departments. To analyze your PagerDuty data in SEI, set up a [PagerDuty SEI integration](/docs/software-engineering-insights/setup-sei/configure-integrations/beta-integrations/sei-integration-pagerduty), and then add PagerDuty reports to your [Insights](/docs/software-engineering-insights/setup-sei/create-and-manage-dashboards/sei-insights.md).

The PagerDuty integration can be configured with the DORA profile to measure the incident recovery time for your engineering team. This feature is an early access feature and is in BETA. To learn more, go to [Measure incident recovery time using PagerDuty and the DORA MTTR report](/docs/software-engineering-insights/get-started/early-access/metrics-reports/mttr-incident-recovery)
