[GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions) is a GitHub feature that enables you to automate various event-driven activities in GitHub, such as cloning a repository, generating Docker images, and testing scripts.

You can find over 10,000 GitHub Actions on the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions) or create your own Actions.

You can use the GitHub Action integration to integrate GitHub Actions with SEI.

:::info
The GitHub Action integration is in BETA and is currently behind the entitlement`ALLOW_GITHUB_ACTION_TILE`. Contact SEI Support to enable the feature.

For more information about supported integrations on SEI, go to [What’s supported](/docs/software-engineering-insights/sei-supported-platforms).
:::

## Requirements

You can either configure the integration using **Github OAuth** or use a **Github personal access token (PAT)**. In case you’re using the integration using a PAT ensure to Copy the token somewhere that you can retrieve it when you configure the integration. For instructions, go to the Github documentation on Creating a personal API token.

If you can't use OAuth, you must create a GitHub personal access token to configure the SEI GitHub integration.

1. Log in to your GitHub account and create a personal access token. For instructions, go to the GitHub documentation on [Managing your personal access tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens).
2. Select the following permissions for your personal access token
   - All repo scopes, including the parent repo scope. The top-level repo scope is required for SEI to have the required visibility into your repos. (repoadmin:org -> read:org permission.)
   - If your GitHub organization uses SAML SSO, enable SSO for your personal access token. For instructions, go to the GitHub documentation on [Authorizing a personal access token for use with SAML SSO](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/authentication/authenticating-with-saml-single-sign-on/authorizing-a-personal-access-token-for-use-with-saml-single-sign-on).

To use a personal access token, paste the token in Enter the Access Token.

1. Select **Integrations** under **Settings**.
2. Select **Available Integrations**, locate the **Github Actions** integration.
3. Select **Install**.
4. Select an authentication method for the integration:
   - To use **OAuth**, select **Authorize** and follow the prompts to grant access to **GitHub**.
   - To use a personal access token, paste the token in **Enter the Access Token**.
5. In **Integration Name**, enter a name for the integration.
6. Select repositories to associate with the integration or select **Ingest All Repos** to associate all current and future repos in your **GitHub organization**.
7. Select **Finish** and **Save** the integration.

</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="satellite" label="Satellite">

The steps for configuring the integration using **Satellite** is similar to configuring the integration on cloud, with the exception of using satellite to communicate with the Github server.

Make sure to select the satellite integration checkbox while configuring the integration.

1. In **Integration Name**, enter a **Name** for the integration.
2. Add a **Description** for the integration. (Optional)
3. In the **URL** field, add the URL where your GitHub repository is deployed.
   For example, if your GitHub is deployed on a virtual machine (VM), add the URL in the format: `<GITHUB_INSTANCE_URL>`

4. Select **Next** and click on **Download the Config file** and save the **satellite.yml** file. Update it following the instructions here.

Here’s a sample `satellite.yml` file:

```yaml
satellite:
  tenant: <ACCOUNT_ID>
  api_key: <ACCOUNT_API_KEY>
  url: "https://app.harness.io/gratis/sei/api" # Note that this URL is relative to the environment you are using.
integrations:
  - id: "<ACCOUNT_ID>"
    application: github_actions
    url: "<GITHUB_INSTANCE_URL>"
    authentication: apikey
```

If you encounter any issues during the integration process, go to the Satellite integration [Troubleshooting and FAQs](/docs/software-engineering-insights/sei-troubleshooting-faqs).

## Ingest artifacts and environment variable data

This topic provides step-by-step instructions on how to set up a GitHub Actions workflow to allow SEI to ingest the data for the artifacts and environment variables from GitHub Actions.

### Pre-requisites

- A GitHub repository for your project.
- SEI API Key & SEI Integration ID
- Access to GitHub Actions in your repository.
- Familiarity with environment variables and GitHub Actions configuration.

### Set up the workflow

Follow these steps to set up the workflow:

1. Create an SEI API Key
   - Go to your SEI account and create an API Key.
   - Give the API Key a name and description.
   - Set the role as `Ingestion`.
2. Create Organization/Repository Secret
   - To securely store the SEI API Key, you can create a GitHub secret in either your organization or your repository, depending on your preference.
   - For Organization Secret, go to [creating secrets in an organization](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/managing-codespaces-for-your-organization/managing-secrets-for-your-repository-and-organization-for-github-codespaces#adding-secrets-for-an-organization) Give the secret a name (e.g., `SEI\_API\_KEY\`) and store the SEI API Key value.
   - For Repository Secret, go to [creating secrets in a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/managing-codespaces-for-your-organization/managing-secrets-for-your-repository-and-organization-for-github-codespaces#adding-secrets-for-a-repository)Give the secret a name (e.g., `SEI\_API\_KEY\`) and store the SEI API Key value.
3. Create the GitHub Actions Integration and make a note of the Integration ID, which you will need in the next steps. For more information, go to [configure the integration on the cloud](#configure-the-integration-on-the-cloud).
4. Append the following steps to your existing GitHub Actions workflow configuration:

```yaml
- name: Push artifacts to SEI Endpoint
  id: push_artifacts
  env:
    base_url: "https://api.propelo.ai" # Change the URL based on your environment (e.g., eu1, asia1, etc.)
    payload: '{"integration_id":"<ADD_INTEGRATION_ID>","repository":"${{ github.repository }}","job_run_number":"${{ github.run_number }}","job_name":"${{ github.workflow }}","artifacts":[{"name":"<ADD_IMAGE_NAME>", "location":"<ADD_LOCATION>", "tag":"<ADD_TAG>", "digest":"<ADD_DIGEST>","type":"<ADD_TYPE>", "artifact_created_at":"<ADD_ARTIFACT_CREATED_AT>"}]}'
  run: curl '${{ env.base_url }}/v1/cicd/push_artifacts' -H 'accept:application/json' -H 'authorization:Apikey ${{ secrets.SEI_API_KEY }}' -H 'content-type:application/json' --data-raw '${{ env.payload }}' --compressed --globoff

- name: Push params to SEI Endpoint
  id: push_params
  env:
    base_url: "https://api.propelo.ai" # Change the URL based on your environment (e.g., eu1, asia1, etc.)
    payload: '{"integration_id":"<ADD_INTEGRATION_ID>","repository":"${{ github.repository }}","job_run_number":"${{ github.run_number }}","job_name":"${{ github.workflow }}","params":[{"name":"<ADD_NAME>","type":"<ADD_TYPE>","value":"<ADD_VALUE>"}]}'
  run: curl '${{ env.base_url }}/v1/cicd/push_job_run_params' -H 'accept:application/json' -H 'authorization:Apikey ${{ secrets.SEI_API_KEY }}' -H 'content-type:application/json' --data-raw '${{ env.payload }}' --compressed --globoff
```

5. Make sure to update the `integration\_id\` in the workflow step with your actual SEI Integration ID. Also, update the `base\_url\` according to your environment:

   - For testui: [https://testapi1.propelo.ai](https://testapi1.propelo.ai)
   - For US: [https://api.propelo.ai](https://api.propelo.ai)
   - For eu1: [https://eu1.api.propelo.ai](https://eu1.api.propelo.ai)\

6. If there is an issue with the SEI endpoint (e.g., if the endpoint is down, 500 internal server error), and you want the workflow run to fail if artifacts are not sent to SEI, use the -f flag in the curl command. For example:

   For example: `curl -f \<REQUEST>`

7. Refer to the metadata below to request and ingest the artifact data from GitHub Actions into SEI.

|                     | Description                                                                                                      |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| name                | Image name of the artifact (e.g., ghcr.io/organization/repository:v0.1.1 where the repository is the image name) |
| location            | Location of the artifact (e.g., ghcr.io/organization)                                                            |
| tag                 | Tag of the image (e.g., ghcr.io/organization/repository:v0.1.1 where v0.1.1 is the tag/qualifier).               |
| digest              | Digest/Hash of the generated artifact (e.g., sha256.).                                                           |
| type                | Type of the generated artifact (optional). If CD is Harness, set type as "container" for correlation.            |
| artifact_created_at | Creation time of the artifact in ISO format (optional, e.g., "2023-01-01T12:00:00.000+00:00").                   |

- name, location, tag, and digest of the artifact are required fields.
- If type, artifact_created_at, or digest are not available you can remove those fields from the object.
- type and artifact_created_at are optional fields.

8. Refer to the metadata below to ingest the environment variables data from GHA into SEI. Note that all the keys mentioned are required fields.

| Keys  | Description                                           |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| name  | The environment variable name                         |
| type  | The type of the environment variable (string/integer) |
| value | The associated value for the environment variable     |

```

:::tip

- If the SEI endpoint is down, the workflow will not capture artifacts or job run parameters. In such cases, you will need to re-run the github actions workflow.
- The artifacts from old workflow runs cannot be ingested into SEI.
- Ensure that the tag names of images are unique to maintain the correct correlation between CI and CD processes.
