Tenable provides actionable insight into your entire infrastructure's security risks.

Use the SEI Tenable integration to integrate SEI with Tenable.

## Requirements

To use the SEI Tenable integration you need a Tenable API Key. Copy the key somewhere that you can retrieve it when you configure the integration. For instructions, go to the Tenable documentation on [generating API keys](https://docs.tenable.com/security-center/Content/GenerateAPIKey.htm).

The user creating the token must have one of the following roles: **Basic**, **Scan Operator**, **Standard**, **Scan Manager**, or **Administrator**.
