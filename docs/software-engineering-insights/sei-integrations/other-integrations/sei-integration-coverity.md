The steps for configuring the integration using **Satellite** is similar to configuring the integration on cloud, with the exception of using satellite to communicate with the Coverity server.

Make sure to select the satellite integration checkbox while configuring the integration. Once you save the integration a satellite.yml file will be automatically generated and downloaded to your computer. Update it following the instructions [here](/docs/software-engineering-insights/sei-ingestion-satellite/satellite-overview).

Hereâ€™s a sample `satellite.yml` file

```yaml
satellite:
  tenant: <ACCOUNT_ID>
  api_key: <ACCOUNT_API_KEY>
  url: 'https://app.harness.io/gratis/sei/api' # Note that this URL is relative to the environment you are using.
integrations:
  - id: '<INTEGRATION_ID>'
    application: coverity
    url: '<COVERITY_URL>' # https://scan.coverity.com/
    username: <COVERITY_USERNAME>
    api_key: <COVERITY_API_KEY>
```

If you encounter any issues during the integration process, go to the Satellite integration [Troubleshooting and FAQs](/docs/software-engineering-insights/sei-ingestion-satellite/satellite-troubleshooting-and-faqs).
