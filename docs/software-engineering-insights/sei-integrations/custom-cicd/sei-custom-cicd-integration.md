SEI supports custom CI/CD integrations using the `/v1/custom-cicd` API. 

Use this for CI/CD tools that don't have a dedicated SEI integration.

:::info
If you have enabled an allow list in your CI/CD tool, certain Harness IP addresses must be added to it in order to allow communication between the Harness Platform and the CI/CD tool. If the necessary IPs are not whitelisted, the integration may fail to authenticate or sync data properly.

To ensure your integration can work correctly, please refer to the list of [Harness Platform IPs](/docs/platform/references/allowlist-harness-domains-and-ips) that may need to be whitelisted in your firewall.
:::

Configure the API according to the following specifications.

## Generate UUID / GUID

Follow the steps to generate a **Globally Unique Identifier (GUID)**. A GUID is used to uniquely identify your custom integration when making requests to the Harness API or configuring Propels.

### Requirements

* Access to **Harness SEI API** with a valid access token. 

### Step 1: Create a CI/CD integration

We need to create a placeholder Custom integration that will be the container for the data. We recommend using **Custom** as the integration type.
Go to **Integrations** under **Settings**, select the **Custom integration**, and click **Install**.
Fill in the following details and **Save** the integration. This will automatically download the `satellite.yml` file with the `<INTEGRATION_ID>`.

| Field       | Description                   |
| - | - |
| Name        | Add a name to the integration |
| Description | Add a description (optional)  |
| Tags        | Add tags if needed (optional) |

### Step 2: Generate a CI/CD Instance GUID associated with that integration

We need to generate a CI/CD instance GUID associated with that integration. This needs to be done with a request to the **Harness SEI API**.
Here is an example using a cURL command:

```shell
curl --location '<CUSTOM_CICD_API>' \ # The Base URL is relative to the environment that you're using.
--header 'Authorization: ApiKey <HARNESS_SEI_API_KEY>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "integration_id": "<INTEGRATION_ID>",
    "name": "Custom CI/CD Integration",
    "type": "jenkins",
}' 
```

Use the `<INTEGRATION_ID>` of the placeholder Custom integration created during Step 1. It can be found in the `satellite.yml` file.
This will generate a GUID for the integration named **Custom CI/CD Integration**.

### Step 3: Integrate directly with the CI/CD Webhook API

You can directly integrate using webhooks as documented above. Make sure to provide the CI/CD instance GUID and name generated in the previous step.

Another option is to integrate using Propels, which allows you to run custom automated workflows directly in SEI. Continue to Step 4 to use this approach.

### Step 4: Import a Propel from the Templates GitHub repository

SEI provides templates for using Propels, which can be imported from this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/harness/harness-sei-propels-templates). You can customize these templates to suit your specific CI/CD tool, such as Jenkins.

### Step 5: Configure the Propel

Once you have generated a GUID in step 2, make sure to update it in the Propel. This is required to identify and link your custom CI/CD integration.

### Step 6: Automate the Propel to run on a schedule

Edit the first node of the Propel to configure a schedule for automation tasks for your custom CI/CD integration. You can use automation to trigger CI/CD jobs, manage deployments, and monitor the integration's performance.
