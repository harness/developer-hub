GitHub Enterprise is a self-hosted, on-premises version of GitHub.

It provides organizations with the tools and features of GitHub, but allows them to host and manage their repositories and collaboration tools within their own infrastructure for enhanced security and control.

Use the SEI Github Enterprise integration to integrate SEI with Github Enterprise.

:::info
The 202401.2 release included a new experience for the GitHub integration, focused on simplifying and streamlining the user journey. The feature is currently in BETA. To learn more, go to [GitHub 2.0](/docs/software-engineering-insights/early-access/integrations/sei-integration-github-easyonboarding)

## Configure the authentication

SEI communicates with Github Enterprise by setting up authentication using a **Personal Access Token (PAT)**. you must create a GitHub personal access token to configure the SEI GitHub integration. To learn more on this, Go to [Configuring the authentication](/docs/software-engineering-insights/sei-integrations/automated-integrations/sei-integration-github#configure-authentication).

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

The steps for configuring the integration using **Satellite** is similar to configuring the integration on cloud, with the exception of using satellite to communicate with the Github enterprise server.

Make sure to select the satellite integration checkbox while configuring the integration. If you experience any issues while configuring the integration using the Ingestion Satellite, refer to the [Ingestion Satellite Troubleshooting and FAQs](/docs/software-engineering-insights/sei-ingestion-satellite/satellite-troubleshooting-and-faqs).

Hereâ€™s a sample `satellite.yml` file:

```yaml
satellite:
  tenant: <ACCOUNT_ID>
  api_key: <ACCOUNT_API_KEY>
  url: 'https://app.harness.io/gratis/sei/api' # Note that this URL is relative to the Environment of your Harness Account.
integrations:
  - id: '<INTEGRATION_ID>'
    application: github_enterprise
    url: 'https://api.github.com'
    metadata:
      repos: <REPOSITORIES>
      is_push_based: true
      fetch_commits: true
      fetch_prs: true
      fetch_issues: true
      fetch_projects: true
      fetch_commit_files: true
    authentication: multiple_api_keys
    keys:
      - api_key: <GITHUB_PAT_1>
        user_name: <GITHUB_USERNAME>
      - api_key: <GITHUB_PAT_2>
        user_name: <GITHUB_USERNAME>
