Azure DevOps (ADO) is a Microsoft product that provides version control, reporting, requirements management, project management, automated builds, testing and release management capabilities. It covers the entire application lifecycle, and enables DevOps capabilities.

Use the SEI Azure DevOps Services integration to integrate SEI with ADO Services. SEI ingests pipelines, Git repos, Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC), and Azure Boards data from ADO Services.

Azure DevOps Services is a cloud offering. To integrate with the on-premises offering, Azure DevOps Server, you must use an [Ingestion Satellite](/docs/software-engineering-insights/sei-ingestion-satellite/satellite-overview).

## Requirements

The following permissions and settings are required to use the SEI ADO Services integration:

* You have registered for Azure DevOps Services and created organizations and projects in ADO.
* All SEI-relevant ADO projects use **Git** for version control.
* You have enabled **Third-party application access via OAuth** in your [ADO organization policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/change-application-access-policies?view=azure-devops).
* Your Azure DevOps account has one of the following access levels: **Basic**, **Basic + Test Plans**, or **Visual Studio Professional/Enterprise**. For more information, go to the Microsoft documentation on [Azure DevOps Access Levels](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/security/access-levels?view=azure-devops#supported-access-levels).
* You have **Reader** permission (or higher) for all SEI-relevant Azure DevOps projects. For more information, go to the Microsoft documentation on [Azure DevOps Permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/security/permissions-access?view=azure-devops).

3. Select **Available Integration**, locate the **Azure DevOps Services** integration, and select **Install**.
4. Configure and save the integration.

   * If you are redirected to Azure DevOps, sign in with your user credentials. Azure DevOps uses OAuth authentication.
   * Enter a **Name** for the integration.
