Drone is a self-service CI platform for busy development teams.

Use the SEI Drone CI integration to integrate SEI with Drone.

To integrate with Harness CI, use the [SEI Harness NG integration](./sei-integration-harnessng).

## Requirements

The following permissions and settings are required to use the SEI Drone CI integration:

* You have set up the Drone platform for your CI pipelines.
* You need your Drone personal API token. To find your token in Drone, select your avatar to go to your **Account Settings**. Either keep the Drone **Account Settings** page open or copy the token somewhere that you can retrieve it when you configure the integration.


import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';


## Configure the integration


<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="cloud" label="Cloud" default>


1. In your Harness project, go to the SEI module, and select **Account**.
2. Select **SEI Integrations** under **Data Settings**.
3. Select **Available Integrations**, locate the **Drone CI** integration, and select **Install**.
4. Configure and save the integration.

   * **URL:** Enter the URL for your Drone platform.
   * **Authorization Token:** Enter your Drone personal API token.
   * **Repositories:** You can specify repositories to associate with the integration. If unspecified, the integration associates all available repositories. Available repositories are repositories that the user associated with the **Authorization Token** can access.
   * **Fetch Step Logs:** Select this option if you want SEI to ingest step logs from Drone.
   * **Name:** Enter a name for the integration.
   * **Description** and **Tags** are optional.

The steps for configuring the integration using **Satellite** is similar to configuring the integration on cloud, with the exception of using satellite to communicate with the Drone CI server.

Make sure to select the satellite integration checkbox while configuring the integration. Once you save the integration a `satellite.yml` file will be automatically generated and downloaded to your computer. Update it following the instructions [here](/docs/software-engineering-insights/sei-ingestion-satellite/satellite-overview).

Hereâ€™s a sample `satellite.yml` file:

```yaml
satellite:
  tenant: <ACCCOUNT_ID>
  api_key: <ACCOUNT_API_KEY>
  url: 'https://app.harness.io/gratis/sei/api' # Note that this URL is relative to the environment you are using.
integrations:
  - id: '<INTEGRATION_ID>'
    application: droneci
    url: '<DRONE_APP_URL>'
    api_key: <DRONE_API_KEY>
    metadata:
      repos: <REPOSITORIES>
      fetch_steplogs: true
      is_push_based: false
```

If you encounter any issues during the integration process, go to the Satellite integration [Troubleshooting and FAQs](/docs/software-engineering-insights/sei-ingestion-satellite/satellite-troubleshooting-and-faqs).
