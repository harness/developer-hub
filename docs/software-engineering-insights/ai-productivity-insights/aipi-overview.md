AI-powered productivity tools help development teams by automating repetitive coding tasks and assisting with code generation. However, measuring the impact of these tools on productivity is still a challenge for many organizations.
Harness Software Engineering Insights provides AI Productivity Insights, offering a set of data-driven metrics and reports to help evaluate how AI tools affect development team performance.

## The why & how of measuring AI productivity

As more engineering teams adopt AI tools, it becomes important to track the impact before and after implementation.
AI code assistants do more than generate codeâ€”they can influence development speed, code quality, and the overall developer experience.
Their usage also introduces changes to the traditional development process and team dynamics.

Harness AI Productivity Insights offers two types of analysis to help track and measure AI adoption:

1. Sentiment Analysis
2. Sentiment & Qualitative Analysis

The choice of analysis depends on your organization's AI adoption stage and the level of detail required in measuring AI productivity.

## Key concepts

### Sentiment analysis

Sentiment analysis focuses on understanding how developers feel about using AI code assistants. It helps capture feedback on aspects such as ease of use, satisfaction, productivity, and innovation.
This method relies on surveys to gather opinions and track developer sentiment across various areas like efficiency and overall experience.

### Sentiment & qualitative analysis

With SCM integrations, this approach provides a detailed report on how AI tools impact team performance. It measures productivity improvements, evaluates code quality, and gathers feedback on AI usage.
By combining both qualitative data and sentiment analysis, organizations can gain a clearer picture of AI adoption benefits and challenges.

### Cohorts

Cohorts help in comparing AI adoption within teams. Each report includes two cohorts: one representing AI tool users and the other representing non-users.
The AI productivity insights compare these cohorts to measure key metrics and determine the productivity improvements AI tools bring to the team.
