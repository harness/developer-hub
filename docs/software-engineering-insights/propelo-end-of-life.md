The Propelo product / platform is being deprecated and will undergo the following milestones in months to come.

## Important dates

### 02/28/2025 - End of Support (EoS)

No Harness support will be provided on the Propelo platform after this date. Only critical Security fixes may be provided. All customers will be supported on the Harness SEI module instead.

### 03/31/2025 - End of Life (EoL)

The Propelo platform will be completely brought down and all accounts will become un-operational. Harness accounts with SEI subscriptions will continue to operate and be supported.

## Migrate to Harness SEI

As part of our ongoing efforts to streamline product offerings and enhance customer experience, all current users of the Propelo platform will be migrated to Harness Software Engineering Insights (SEI). This transition aligns with our strategy to focus on the continued development and advancement of the Harness SEI module.

For detailed migration instructions, please refer to the [Migration guide](/docs/software-engineering-insights/get-started/migrate-propelo-to-harness/migrate-propelo-to-harness-sei)

### Next steps

If you are interested in starting the migration from the Propelo platform to Harness SEI module, please contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io) to request migration support.
