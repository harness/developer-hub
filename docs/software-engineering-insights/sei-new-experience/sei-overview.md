We’re excited to introduce SEI 2.0, a completely reimagined experience that marks a significant step forward in how engineering organizations measure and improve developer productivity and delivery efficiency. The SEI 2.O experience is built on a new architecture with performance, flexibility, and extensibility at its core.

## What’s New

### Modern Architecture

SEI 2.0 is built on a new architecture designed for performance, scalability, and resilience. Whether you're a team of 50 or 5,000 or more, the new system is developed to scale and essentially give you insights you can trust.

### Built-In Dashboards

Get started instantly with pre-built dashboards focused on:

* Delivery Efficiency (DORA)
* Developer Productivity

These dashboards follow industry best practices and can be customized to match your team’s goals.

### Advanced Team Builder

Every organization structures teams differently, some follow reporting lines, others group by region, business unit, or function. In reality, it’s often a mix of both. SEI 2.0 introduces a smarter way to build and manage your teams, so your insights always reflect how your org actually works.

You can create teams using:

* **Org Tree Builder using CSV:** Upload a simple CSV to define your organization structure.
* **Integrate directly with your HRIS system (Coming Soon):** Automatically sync team structures from systems like Workday or BambooHR.
* **Third-Party Imports (Coming Soon):** Bring in teams directly from tools you already use, like GitHub Teams or Jira Projects.

### Integrations 2.0

With improved health monitoring, diagnostics, and retry logic, setting up and maintaining integrations is faster, easier, and more resilient.

### Decentralized Administration

Contributors & Team Definitions in SEI 2.0 can be managed at scale with decentralized controls. Admins can delegate access and configuration responsibilities without compromising governance.
