The Efficiency dashboard in SEI 2.0 gives you a focused view into how quickly and reliably your teams deliver softwareâ€”based on the proven DORA metrics framework.

This dashboard is designed to help engineering leaders and teams identify where their delivery process is smooth, and where delays or bottlenecks may be slowing things down.

We track four key metrics:

* **Deployment Frequency:** How often your teams are pushing code to production.
* **Lead Time for Changes:** How long it takes for code to go from commit to live.
* **Change Failure Rate:** The percentage of deployments that result in a failure or require immediate fix.
* **Mean Time to Restore (MTTR):** How quickly your team can recover from an incident or failure in production.
