# Key concepts

This topic covers basic terminology and concepts related to SEI. For information about creating SEI Insights and configuring integrations go to [Insights](../sei-insights)

## Projects

Projects are a centralized hub in SEI enabling users to organize and navigate across Collection hierarchies, and easily access dashboards associated with specific Collections.

By default, a Project consists of two top-level Collection categories: Teams and Sprints, each with options to customize. Each Collection category can have other Collections defined under them in parent-child relationships.

For more information, Go to [Projects and Collections](../sei-projects-and-collections/project-and-collection-overview)

## Insights

Insights in SEI provide a visual representation of key metrics and KPIs, enabling engineering teams to monitor their performance and identify areas for improvement. To create a dashboard in SEI, users can utilize pre-built widgets that are specifically designed to display relevant data points. These widgets can be customized and arranged on the insight canvas to create a comprehensive view of team performance.

For more information, go to [Insights](../sei-insights)

## Ingestion Satellite

Ingestion Satellite is used to integrate your on-premise tools and custom integrations into your SEI workspace. It enables data ingestion and integration with various third-party applications and services. For more information, go to Ingestion Satellite Overview

## Integrations

To calculate meaningful metrics and optimize your software development lifecycle, it's essential to integrate your SDLC tools with the Software Engineering Intelligence (SEI) platform. SEI integrations provide a seamless way to connect your SDLC tools, such as Git providers, issue management systems, and communication tools, with the Harness Platform and its modules.

### Types of SEI Integrations

There are two types of SEI integrations available:

#### Application-Specific SEI Integrations

These integrations are tailored to specific SDLC tools and provide a more comprehensive set of features and functionality. Examples of application-specific SEI integrations include GitHub, Jira, and Bitbucket.

#### Custom SEI Integration

This allows you to extract data from various tools and services, including those not natively supported by SEI. For more information, go to Custom Integrations

## Profiles

A profile in SEI represents an entity where users define a specific set of metrics, criteria, or parameters that are used to assess and evaluate different aspects of software engineering processes, performance, and productivity.

SEI provides 3 different types of profiles:

1. **Investment Profile:** Investment profiles help you understand where engineers are allocating their time through effort investment metrics. For more information, Go to [Investment Profile](../sei-profiles/investment-profile).

2. **Workflow Profile:** Workflow profile is an entity in SEI where users define the stages, events, and measurement criteria to assess the entire development process lifecycle. You can use these profiles to derive insights on time taken to ship changes or the time taken for bug fixes to reach production etc. For more information, Go to [Workflow Profile](../sei-profiles/workflow-profile).

3. **Trellis Profile:** Trellis Scores are a proprietary scoring mechanism from SEI. Your Trellis Score helps you understand your team's productivity. Trellis Scores are calculated from factors such as code quality, code volume, speed, impact, proficiency, and collaboration. For more information, Go to [Trellis Profile](../sei-profiles/trellis-profile).

### Metrics & Reports

Metrics and Reports in SEI refer to various key performance indicators and data-driven insights that are used to assess and improve a software development team's performance and productivity. These are predefined widgets which can be customized and used for generating insights on tracking, analyzing, and optimizing different aspects of the development process.
