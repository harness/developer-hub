This topic provides answers to common questions about migrating from the Propelo platform to Harness Software Engineering Insights (SEI).

For details migration steps, go to [Migration Guide](/docs/software-engineering-insights/get-started/migrate-propelo-to-harness/migrate-propelo-to-harness-sei)

## What is Harness Software Engineering Insights?

Harness has reimagined the Propelo platform and built a new version with Harness Software Engineering Insights module. We intend for the platform to improve the developer experience.

Harness SEI enables engineering leaders to make data-driven decisions that improve engineering productivity, efficiency, alignment, planning, and execution. It provides actionable insights into software delivery and workflows across teams, processes, and systems to improve software quality, enhance developer experience, and accelerate time to value.

## What will happen to the Propelo platform?

The Propelo product / platform is being deprecated and will undergo the following milestones in months to come:

#### 02/28/2025 - End of Support (EoS)

No Harness support will be provided on the Propelo platform after this date. Only critical Security fixes may be provided. All customers will be supported on the Harness SEI module instead.

#### 03/31/2025 - End of Life (EoL)

The Propelo platform will be completely brought down and all accounts will become un-operational. Harness accounts with SEI subscriptions will continue to operate and be supported.

Once the migration is completed to Harness SEI, your Propelo platform access will be revoked.

## Does migrating impact Propelo platform usage?

No. Migrating to Harness SEI does not impact your existing Propelo platform usage.

Note that during migration all the ingestion process will be paused and no edit actions will be allowed on the Propelo platform.

## Does migrating to Harness SEI impact my licensing or billing?

No. Migrating to Harness SEI NextGen will not impact your current plan. Your current billing plan will remain the same.

## How will access control be managed if I already have a Harness account?

Your existing access control settings will not be impacted due to migration. After the migration, all Propelo users will receive invitations to access the Harness SEI module with role assignments based on their previous Propelo permissions.

For details on Propelo roles mapping to Harness roles, go to [Migration guide](/docs/software-engineering-insights/get-started/migrate-propelo-to-harness/migrate-propelo-to-harness-sei#improved-rbac-capabilities).

## What happens if I have a project in Harness with the same name as on the Propelo platform?

There will be no conflicts. The existing project will be updated to include the SEI module data.

## Are all Propelo platform features available in Harness SEI?

No. Some lesser-used features from the Propelo platform have not been included in Harness SEI.
