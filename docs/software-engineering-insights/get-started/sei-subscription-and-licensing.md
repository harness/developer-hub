## License Overview

Your SEI subscription includes a specific number of **Contributor licenses**. These licenses track the number of **Contributors** identified by SEI across all integrated SDLC tools.

### Contributors

A **Contributor** is an identified user profile that SEI tracks and analyzes across multiple SDLC tools.

* One developer may use different usernames or email addresses in various SDLC tools.
* SEI correlates user accounts from all integrated SDLC tools to create a unified profile for each identified developer.
* This unified profile is called a **Contributor**.

## License Calculation

Your SEI subscription includes a specific number of **Contributor licenses**. A Contributor is counted as a licensing unit if they have at least one user account associated with an integrated **Source Code Management (SCM)** tool, such as [GitHub](/docs/software-engineering-insights/setup-sei/configure-integrations/github/sei-github-integration), [GitLab](/docs/software-engineering-insights/setup-sei/configure-integrations/gitlab/sei-integration-gitlab), [Bitbucket](/docs/software-engineering-insights/setup-sei/configure-integrations/bitbucket/sei-bitbucket-cloud) or any other. If a User has accounts in other SDLC tools but no account with an SCM tool, they are not counted as a licensing unit.

All Contributors who have made contributions to the SCM tool are considered Contributors and require a license.

:::info
Contributors with past contributions in the SCM still require a license, even if they haven't contributed recently.
