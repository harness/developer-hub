## Phase 1: Setup your Harness account

### SaaS

Harness Platform is purpose-built to help developers and DevOps teams deliver software with the highest velocity, quality, security, reliability, and resilience as well as the lowest cost possible while remaining inside the governance guardrails necessary for meeting organizational goals.

**Harness SaaS** is a fully managed cloud version of Harness Platform that is accessible via multiple plans.

**Team & Enterprise Plans:** You must have received an invitation email from your Account Administrator. Reach out to **support@harness.io** if you need more information or if you do not know who your **Account Administrator** is.

After your account has been created, you can sign in to your Harness account [here](https://app.harness.io/).

### Self-Managed Enterprise Edition​

[Harness Self-Managed Enterprise Edition (aka SMP)](/docs/self-managed-enterprise-edition/get-started/onboarding-guide) is a self-managed, Kubernetes-native version of Harness Platform that runs on your own public or private cloud infrastructure. This option requires access to a Harness SMP license key as well as the ability to download **Harness SMP software** (container images & Helm Chart). Reach out to `support@harness.io` if you do not have access to either the license key or the download location.

* After you have access to the license key and the software, you will have to first install and configure an instance of Harness SMP by following the instructions listed at Install Harness SMP using Helm Chart.
* After you install, follow these instructions to create your Harness Account on SMP.

You can sign in to your Harness Account on SMP anytime at `http://\<YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME>/auth/#/signin`.

### Step 1 - Review key concepts

If you're new to Harness, review the [Harness Platform onboarding guide](/docs/platform/get-started/onboarding-guide) and [Harness Platform key concepts](/docs/platform/get-started/key-concepts) before onboarding to SEI.

Review the following resources to learn about the features, components, and key concepts of Harness SEI.

* [SEI overview](/docs/software-engineering-insights/get-started/overview): Learn about Harness SEI module and key features.
* [SEI key concepts](/docs/software-engineering-insights/get-started/sei-key-concepts): Get definitions of common components and integrations you'll encounter in Harness SEI, such as Ingestion Satellite, Integrations, Insights, Collections, and more.

### Step 2 - Create a sample project and invite collaborators​

**Projects**, in addition to the roles they serve elsewhere in the Harness Platform, provide an umbrella for you to organize the **Collection** hierarchy and access Insights associated with specific **Collections**.

**Collection categories** and **Collections** exist under their associated project; they don't span across projects. While multiple projects can have Collection categories and Collections with the same name, these are distinct groups under their designated project.

#### Prerequisites​

* Make sure you have the **Create** permissions for **Project** to create a Project.

#### Create a project​

You can create Projects in custom Org from the projects section of Harness, or from within the `default` org. In this example, we'll create projects in `default`.

1. In **Harness**, go to **Home** and click **Projects**.
2. Click **+Project**.
3. Name the project, and select a colour. The `ID` of the project is generated automatically. See [Harness Entity Reference](/docs/platform/references/harness-entity-reference).
4. In **Organization**, keep the org as `default`.
5. Add a description and tags, and then click **Save** and **Continue**.
6. In **Invite Collaborators**, type a member's name and select it.
7. Select a role for the member, and click **Add**.
8. Click **Save** and **Continue** to create the project.


#### Add modules​

Next, select the **Module selection** icon at the top right in the **Navigation menu**.

1. Select the **Modules** you want to use in your project. You can select more at any time.
2. Close the modules and open your **Project** in projects or in the `default` organization.
3. When you open the project, all the modules are displayed.
4. Pick the **SEI module** and you will automatically be redirected to the **Integration Mapping** page.

#### Project FAQs​

<details>
<summary>Can I move resources between projects?​</summary>

Harness does not support moving resources between projects or organizations at the moment.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What is the best way to decommission a project while retaining its history?​​</summary>

Harness recommends removing RBAC access to the project and only allowing users to view it or hiding it from most users. Admins are the only ones who can view configurations and deployment history in a project. Deleting a project will also delete its deployment history. To keep your history, it is better to leave the project available but block access and usage.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Is there a limit on how many orgs or projects I can create in my account?​​​</summary>

There is no limitation on the number of projects that you can create in an account. For organizations, we recommend you to use the default organization while using SEI.

</details>

## Phase 2: Single Sign-On (Automate onboarding of users from external sources)

You can automate the onboarding of users from external sources along with their user group memberships & role assignments.

Harness supports **Single Sign-On (SSO)** with **SAML**, **LDAP (including Active Directory and OpenLDAP)**, and **OAuth** integrating with your SSO provider to enable you to log your users into Harness as part of your SSO infrastructure.

### API

Use the [API quickstart](/docs/platform/automation/api/api-quickstart) to get started.

## Phase 3: Integration Mapping

After you have created your project, you can begin setting up and mapping integrations as an **Admin**. 

To learn more, go to [Integration Mapping](/docs/software-engineering-insights/sei-integrations/sei-integrations-overview#integration-mapping).

### Integration Overview

To calculate metrics, you must integrate your SDLC tools with SEI.
SEI integrations are handled through SEI integrations. SEI integrations contain the information necessary for the Harness Platform and modules to integrate and work with SDLC tools, such as Git providers, issue management systems, communication tools, and more.

Harness SEI supports integrations with both Cloud and On-Prem third-party tools. To learn more about the supported integrations on Harness SEI, go to [What's Supported](/docs/software-engineering-insights/sei-supported-platforms).

### Cloud Integrations & On-Prem Integrations

SEI integrates with several third-party providers to provide centralized visibility on engineering work.

If you want to integrate SEI with your on-premise tools, you can use the [Ingestion Satellite](/docs/software-engineering-insights/sei-ingestion-satellite/satellite-overview) to configure the integration.
**Ingestion Satellite** is used to integrate your on-premise tools and custom integrations into your SEI project. 

It enables data ingestion and integration with various third-party applications and services. **Satellites** are configured while installing the **SEI integrations** in the integration configuration, within the **Data Settings**. Now we can configure the satellite for a supported, application-specific integration or a Custom CI/CD integration. SEI ​does not​ store satellite credentials.

To learn more about how to use the satellite to configure an integration, go to [Ingestion Satellite](/docs/software-engineering-insights/sei-ingestion-satellite/satellite-overview).

You can also create custom CI/CD integration. Find the instructions to create a custom CI/CD integration on SEI [here](/docs/software-engineering-insights/sei-integrations/custom-cicd/sei-custom-cicd-integration).

The required credentials and method of authentication vary with the integration type and the third-party tool. To learn more about how to configure the integration on SEI, refer to the [integration-specific documentation](/docs/category/sei-integrations).

## Phase 4: Collection Setup

**Collections** are groupings representing subdivisions of a Collection category. By default, each Collection category has one **root**, or **All**, **Collection**. For example, the ***Teams*** category automatically has an **All Teams** Collection. Under the root Collection, you can create any number of Collections and Collection levels.

Review the following resources to learn more about **Collection Categories** and **Collections** hierarchy.

* [Project and Collection Hierarchy](/docs/software-engineering-insights/sei-projects-and-collections/project-and-collection-overview): Learn about how the collection hierarchy is defined on Harness SEI
* [Manage collection categories](/docs/software-engineering-insights/sei-projects-and-collections/manage-collection-cat): Learn how you can add, view, edit, and enable/disable Collection categories
* [Manage collections](/docs/software-engineering-insights/sei-projects-and-collections/manage-collections): Learn how you can add, view, edit, and manage Insight associations with a collection
* [Manage contributors](/docs/software-engineering-insights/sei-contributors/manage-contributors): Learn how to add contributors and configure the contributor attributes

## Phase 5: Profiles Setup

A **Profile** in SEI represents an entity where users define a different set of metrics, criteria, or parameters. It is used to define their software development process that helps in measuring different aspects of software engineering performance, and productivity.

SEI provides 3 different types of profiles:

* [Investment Profile / Business Alignment Profile](/docs/software-engineering-insights/sei-profiles/business-alignment-profile): Business Alignment profiles help you understand where engineers are allocating their time through effort investment metrics. It is one of the most critical components of engineering metrics by connecting engineering to business value.
* [Trellis Profile](/docs/software-engineering-insights/sei-profiles/trellis-profile): The Trellis Scores feature on SEI provides a proprietary scoring mechanism to evaluate and understand your engineering team's productivity. The Trellis Profile is the entity that lets you customize the standards and thresholds for calculating the Trellis Score. 
* [Workflow Profile](/docs/software-engineering-insights/sei-profiles/workflow-profiles/workflow-profile-overview): Workflow profile is an entity in SEI where users define the stages, events, and measurement criteria to assess the entire development process lifecycle using Lead Time and DORA metrics. You can use these profiles to derive insights on the time taken to ship changes or the time taken for bug fixes to reach production etc.

## Phase 6: Insights Creation

**Insights** are dashboards that make it easy to visualize and interpret metrics that are captured by SEI. With a variety of out-of-the-box widgets, you can create Insights that show the data you care about most and help you understand your engineering team's effectiveness and efficiency.

### Create and Manage Insights

Review the following resources to learn more about creating and managing Insights.

## Phase 7: Role-Based Access Control

Harness RBAC includes Roles and Permissions that enable you to control access to the SEI resources in your Harness account.  
Harness SEI has three built-in user roles:

* SEI Admin
* SEI Collection Admin
* SEI Viewer
