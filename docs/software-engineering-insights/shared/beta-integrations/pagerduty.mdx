PagerDuty is a SaaS incident response platform for IT departments. Use the SEI PagerDuty integration to integrate Harness SEI with any cloud-based PagerDuty account or plan.

:::note
The 202403.2 release added support for measuring the incident recovery time using the DORA MTTR report for the PagerDuty integration. To learn more, go to [Measure incident recovery time](/docs/software-engineering-insights/propelo-sei/get-started/early-access/metrics-reports/mttr-incident-recovery).
:::

## Requirements

To use the SEI PagerDuty integration, you need a **read-only PagerDuty API key**. 

<img src={pagerdutyApiKey} alt="Creating a read-only PagerDuty API key" width="500" />

For instructions on creating a PagerDuty API access key, see the [official PagerDuty documentation](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/api-access-keys). Copy the key somewhere you can retrieve it when you configure the integration. 

:::info
If you have enabled an allowlist in your PagerDuty account, certain Harness IP addresses must be added to it in order to allow communication between the Harness Platform and PagerDuty. If the necessary IPs are not whitelisted, the integration may fail to authenticate or sync data properly.

To ensure your integration can work correctly, refer to the list of [Harness Platform IPs](/docs/platform/references/allowlist-harness-domains-and-ips) that may need to be whitelisted in your firewall.

Once the integration is configured, you can use Filters for PagerDuty fields such as PD Service, Incident Priority, Incident Urgency, Alert Severity, and User ID, in the Collection definition.

## Configure the integration

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="cloud" label="Cloud" default>

1. In your **Harness Project**, go to the **SEI Module**, and select **Account**.
2. Select **Integrations** under **Data Settings**.
3. Select **Available Integrations**, locate the **PagerDuty** integration, and select **Install**.
4. Configure the following fields:

   * **URL:** Enter `https://api.pagerduty.com`, unless you have a special use case that requires a different URL.
   * **Username:** The email address of the user that created the API key in PagerDuty.
   * **API Key:** Enter your PagerDuty API key.
   * **Name:** Enter a name for the integration.
   * **Description** and **Tags**: Optionally, add a description and relevant tags for the integration.

1. Save the integration.

:::warning
To integrate with an on-premises PagerDuty offering, you must use an [Ingestion Satellite](/docs/category/ingestion-satellite).

The steps for configuring the integration using the Ingestion Satellite is similar to configuring the integration on cloud, with the exception of using the satellite to communicate with the PagerDuty server.

While configuring the integration, ensure that you have selected the satellite integration checkbox. Once you save the integration, a `satellite.yml` file will be automatically generated and downloaded to your computer. For instructions on updating this file, see [Ingestion Satellite](/docs/software-engineering-insights/propelo-sei/setup-sei/sei-ingestion-satellite/satellite-overview).

Hereâ€™s a sample `satellite.yml` file:

```yaml
satellite:
  tenant: <ACCOUNT_ID>
  api_key: <ACCOUNT_API_KEY>
  url: 'https://app.harness.io/gratis/sei/api' 
  # Note that this URL is relative to the Environment of your Harness Account.

integrations:
  - id: '<INTEGRATION_ID>'
    application: pagerduty
    url: <PAGERDUTY_INSTANCE_URL>
    username: <PAGERDUTY_USERNAME>
    api_key: <PAGERDUTY_API_KEY>
```

If you experience any issues while configuring the integration using the Ingestion Satellite, refer to the [Ingestion Satellite Troubleshooting and FAQs](/docs/software-engineering-insights/propelo-sei/setup-sei/sei-ingestion-satellite/satellite-troubleshooting-and-faqs).
