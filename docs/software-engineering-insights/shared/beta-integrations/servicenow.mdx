:::info
The SEI ServiceNow integration is in beta and is accessible behind the Feature Flag `<SEI_SERVICENOW>`. Contact [Harness Support](/docs/software-engineering-insights/sei-support) to enable this feature.
:::

ServiceNow is used to set up systems that define, manage, automate and structure IT services for companies. You can use the SEI ServiceNow integration to integrate Harness SEI with [ServiceNow Cloud](#connect-with-servicenow-cloud) and ServiceNow On-Prem accounts.

The SEI ServiceNow integration allows you to track, manage, and analyze incidents, and change requests in real-time, leading to improved efficiency and enhanced productivity.

## Requirements

To connect ServiceNow with Harness SEI, you can choose between two authentication methods:

* **Using Username and Password:** Use the service account credentials for direct authentication.
* **Using OAuth:** Use token-based authentication with OAuth credentials.

Ensure the service account has the required credentials and permissions to successfully configure the integration.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Using OAuth" default>

### OAuth Credentials

To configure the integration using OAuth-based authentication, you'll need to generate the following credentials in your ServiceNow instance:

* [ServiceNow Client ID](#create-a-client-id-and-client-secret-in-servicenow)
* [ServiceNow Client Secret](#create-a-client-id-and-client-secret-in-servicenow)

These credentials are essential for secure, token-based authentication between your application and the ServiceNow platform. To generate the credentials, go to [Create a Client ID and Client Secret in ServiceNow](#create-a-client-id-and-client-secret-in-servicenow).

### Required permissions

When configuring the ServiceNow integration, ensure the service account has the following roles:

* **itil:** Provides access to IT Service Management (ITSM) functionalities.
* **oauth_admin:** Required only if using the OAuth flow for creating integrations. This role allows management of OAuth applications.
* **personalize_choices:** Enables customization of choice lists.
* **personalize_dictionary:** Allows modification of dictionary entries.

To fetch data for all users within the ServiceNow instance, the following roles are required:

* **user:** Basic role assigned to all ServiceNow users.
* **user_admin:** Provides administrative capabilities over user accounts.

:::info
If you have enabled an allowlist in your ServiceNow account, certain Harness IP addresses must be added to it in order to allow communication between the Harness Platform and ServiceNow. If the necessary IPs are not whitelisted, the integration may fail to authenticate or sync data properly.

To ensure your integration can work correctly, refer to the list of [Harness Platform IPs](/docs/platform/references/allowlist-harness-domains-and-ips) that may need to be whitelisted in your firewall.

## ServiceNow Use Cases

The ServiceNow integration primarily is used for measuring the incident recovery time using the DORA Mean Time to Restore (MTTR) widget.

For detailed instructions on setting up and configuring the DORA profile to effectively measure MTTR using the ServiceNow integration, see [Measure incident recovery time](/docs/software-engineering-insights/propelo-sei/get-started/early-access/metrics-reports/mttr-incident-recovery).
