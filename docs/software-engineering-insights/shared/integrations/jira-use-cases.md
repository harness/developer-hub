For engineering leaders focused on optimizing Agile practices, tracking relevant Jira metrics is critical. These metrics can help you measure productivity, quality, and project predictability, providing insights into team performance.

In this page, we recommended some of the most used Jira performance metrics that helps engineering teams boost efficiency and effectiveness.

## Key widgets

### Measure DORA

For teams working on DevOps, DORA metrics like Lead Time for Changes and Mean Time to Restore (MTTR) are important. If your team uses Jira to track these, the widgets below can help identify delays in delivery or recovery from issues.

* [Lead Time for Changes](/docs/software-engineering-insights/propelo-sei/analytics-and-reporting/efficiency/dora-metrics/#lead-time-for-changes)
* [Mean Time to Restore](/docs/software-engineering-insights/propelo-sei/analytics-and-reporting/efficiency/dora-metrics/#mean-time-to-restore-mttr)

### Business alignment

A measure of how effectively engineering efforts contribute to strategic business outcomes, such as customer satisfaction, adoption, and operational efficiency. Use the Jira integration to set up a Business Alignment profile within SEI, and use the Business Alignment widget to track key alignment metrics.

* [Configure the Business Alignment widget](/docs/software-engineering-insights/propelo-sei/analytics-and-reporting/sei-business-alignment)

### Sprint activity tracking

Use these widgets to measure crucial sprint metrics, like Velocity and Predictability, providing insight into how consistently teams deliver within a sprint.

* [Single Stats](/docs/software-engineering-insights/propelo-sei/analytics-and-reporting/efficiency/agile-metrics/sei-sprints-metrics-reports#sprint-metrics-single-stat)
* [Sprint Trend Report](/docs/software-engineering-insights/propelo-sei/analytics-and-reporting/efficiency/agile-metrics/sei-sprints-metrics-reports#jira-trend-reporting-sub-tasks)
* [Sprint Metrics Precentage Trend Report](/docs/software-engineering-insights/propelo-sei/analytics-and-reporting/efficiency/agile-metrics/sei-sprints-metrics-reports#sprint-metrics-percentage-trend-report)

### Track hygiene

Hygiene refers to how well the team manages and tracks ongoing work, which supports effective planning. Good hygiene practices reflect a team’s discipline in tracking issues, addressing backlogs, and planning future work. Use these widgets to pinpoint areas that need attention, identify process bottlenecks, and ensure work management practices align with the team’s goals.

* [Hygiene report](/docs/software-engineering-insights/propelo-sei/analytics-and-reporting/hygiene-metrics)
* [Issues report](/docs/software-engineering-insights/propelo-sei/analytics-and-reporting/efficiency/issues-reports)
* [Issues Backlog Trend report](/docs/software-engineering-insights/propelo-sei/analytics-and-reporting/efficiency/issues-reports)
* [Issue Resolution Time report](/docs/software-engineering-insights/propelo-sei/analytics-and-reporting/efficiency/issues-reports)
