GitLab Private Cloud is a managed, self-hosted version of GitLab. To connect with GitLab Cloud, go to [Connect with GitLa Cloud](/docs/software-engineering-insights/propelo-sei/setup-sei/configure-integrations/gitlab/sei-integration-gitlab).

To connect Harness SEI with Github Private Cloud, you'll need to use the [Ingestion Satellite](/docs/software-engineering-insights/propelo-sei/setup-sei/sei-ingestion-satellite/run-the-satellite-container).

### Configure authentication

The SEI GitLab integration can use either OAuth or personal access token authentication. For OAuth, your account must have the **Reporter** role or higher.

If you can't use OAuth, you must create a GitLab personal access token to configure the SEI GitLab integration.

1. Log in to your GitLab account and create a personal access token. For instructions, go to the GitLab documentation on [Personal Access Tokens](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html).
2. Select the `api` scope with read API access.
3. Copy the token somewhere that you can retrieve it when you configure the integration.

:::info
If you have enabled an allowlist in your GitLab account, certain Harness IP addresses must be added to it in order to allow communication between the Harness Platform and GitLab. If the necessary IPs are not whitelisted, the integration may fail to authenticate or sync data properly.

To ensure your integration can work correctly, refer to the list of [Harness Platform IPs](/docs/platform/references/allowlist-harness-domains-and-ips) that may need to be whitelisted in your firewall.

### Add the integration

Follow the steps below to configure the integration:

1. In your **Harness Project**, go to the **SEI Module**, and select **Account**.
2. Select **Integrations** under **Data Settings**.
3. Select **Available Integrations**, locate the **GitLab** integration, and select **Install**.
4. Choose the type of **Gitlab Account** as **Gitlab Satellite** and select the **Gitlab Private Cloud** option.
5. In **Integration Name**, enter a name for the integration.
6. Add a **Description** for the integration. (Optional)
7. In the **URL** field, add the URL where your Gitlab repository is deployed.
8. Enter the **Personal Access Token** that you previously generated for the Gitlab account.
9. If applicable, configure **Additional Options**:
   1. **Fetch PRs**: Allow SEI to ingest PR data from Gitlab.
   2. **Fetch Issues**: Allow SEI to ingest data from Gitlab Issues.
   3. **Fetch Projects**: Allow SEI to ingest data from Gitlab Projects.
   4. **Fetch Commits**: Allow SEI to ingest commit metadata from Gitlab.
   5. **Fetch Commit Files**: Allow SEI to ingest data within commits from Gitlab.
10. Click on **Download YAML File** and save the `satellite.yml` file. Update it by following the instructions [here](/docs/software-engineering-insights/propelo-sei/setup-sei/sei-ingestion-satellite/satellite-overview).

If you experience any issues while configuring the integration using the Ingestion Satellite, refer to the [Ingestion Satellite Troubleshooting and FAQs](/docs/software-engineering-insights/propelo-sei/setup-sei/sei-ingestion-satellite/satellite-troubleshooting-and-faqs).

Hereâ€™s a sample `satellite.yml` file:

```yaml
satellite:
  tenant: <ACCOUNT_ID>
  api_key: <ACCOUNT_API_KEY>
  url: 'https://app.harness.io/gratis/sei/api'
  # Note that this URL is relative to the Environment of your Harness Account.

integrations:
  - id: '<INTEGRATION_ID>' # For ex: 4691
    application: gitlab
    url: '<GITLAB_INSTANCE_URL>'
    metadata:
      fetch_prs: true
      fetch_issues: true
      fetch_projects: true
      fetch_commits: true
      fetch_commit_files: true
    authentication: apikey

```

### Supported metadata fields

Use the following optional metadata fields to optimize the ingestion functionality while configuring the integration using the Ingestion Satellite:

| Name | Field | Values | Properties |
| - | - | - | - |
| Check Project Membership | `check_project_membership` | The supported values are True/False. By default, this field is set to `True`. | When set to `True`, SEI selectively considers projects based on token owner membership. For self-hosted Gitlab instances, switching to `False` enables SEI to fetch all projects, regardless of the membership. You should never disable this for cloud Gitlab instances. |
| Fetch PR Patches | `fetch_pr_patches` | The supported values are `True/False` | This field determines whether to retrieve patches or file differentials for Pull Requests (PRs). | 
| Fetch Commit Patches | `fetch_commit_patches` | The supported values are `True/False` | This field governs the inclusion of commit patches or file differentials in the data. |
| Fetch Pipelines | `fetch_pipelines` | The supported values are `True/False` | This field specifies whether to fetch pipeline data. |
| PR Commit Limit | `pr_commit_limit` | Default value: 250 | This field sets a cap on the number of commits fetched per Pull Request. |

If you encounter any issues during the integration process, go to the Satellite integration [Troubleshooting and FAQs](/docs/software-engineering-insights/propelo-sei/setup-sei/sei-ingestion-satellite/satellite-troubleshooting-and-faqs).
