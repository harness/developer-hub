Bitbucket is a web-based version control repository hosting service, for source code and development projects that use either Mercurial or Git revision control systems.

This page describes the settings and permissions for the Bitbucket integration. Harness SEI supports both Cloud and Data Center (On-Prem) versions of Bitbucket. The following settings are applicable to Bitbucket Data Center.

### Requirements

The following permissions and settings are required to use the SEI Bitbucket integration:

* You have a Bitbucket account.
* Your role is **Member** or higher.

:::info
If you have enabled an allow list in your Bitbucket account, certain Harness IP addresses must be added to it in order to allow communication between the Harness Platform and Bitbucket. If the necessary IPs are not whitelisted, the integration may fail to authenticate or sync data properly.

To ensure your integration can work correctly, please refer to the list of [Harness Platform IPs](/docs/platform/references/allowlist-harness-domains-and-ips) that may need to be whitelisted in your firewall.

### Add the integration

[Bitbucket Data Center (also known as Bitbucket Enterprise)](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bitbucket/enterprise) is a self-managed solution for source code collaboration. Harness SEI supports connecting with both private and public Bitbucket On-Prem instances.

1. In your **Harness Project**, select the **SEI Module**, and go to your **Account**.
2. Select **Integrations** under **Data Settings**.
3. Select **Available Integrations**, and locate the **Bitbucket integration**, and select **Install**.

4. Select the type of your Bitbucket account as **Data Center**.
5. Choose **Authentication Method**:
   1. Use **Personal Access Token (PAT)** to connect to a **Public On-Prem Bitbucket** server.
   2. Use **Ingestion Satellite** to connect to a **Private On-Prem Bitbucket** server.
