To collaborate and share Harness information with other users and groups, add a Collaboration Provider. You can use your SMTP server, Jira, or ServiceNow for deployment notifications, approvals, and tracking. 

See the How-tos for adding these providers:

* [Add Jira Collaboration Provider](add-jira-collaboration-provider.md)
* [Add ServiceNow Collaboration Provider](add-service-now-collaboration-provider.md)
