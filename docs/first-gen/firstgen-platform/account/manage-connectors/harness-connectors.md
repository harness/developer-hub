Harness integrates with many different types of repositories and providers. We call connections to cloud platforms **Cloud Providers** and connections to other platforms **Connectors**.

**Cloud Providers** connect to your deployment environments, such as Kubernetes Clusters, AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Azure, Pivotal Cloud Foundry, and Physical Data Centers.

**Connectors** help you pull in artifacts, sync with repos, integrate verification and analytics tools, and leverage collaboration channels.

The following topics describe each of the Harness integrations you can make:

* [Add Cloud Providers](cloud-providers.md)
* [Add Artifact Servers](configuring-artifact-server.md)
* [Add Source Repo Providers](add-source-repo-providers.md)
* [Add Collaboration Providers](collaboration-providers.md)
* [Add Verification Providers](verification-providers.md)
