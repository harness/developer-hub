This content is for Harness [FirstGen](../../../../getting-started/harness-first-gen-vs-harness-next-gen.md). Switch to [NextGen](../../../../platform/3_Authentication/1-authentication-overview.md).Administrators can use Authentication Settings to restrict access to an organization's Harness account. The options you choose will apply to all your account's users. These options include:

* Enabling specific SSO (single sign-on) mechanisms and providers.
* Enforcing password policies (strength, expiration, and lockout).
* Enforcing 2FA (two factor authentication).
* Restricting logins by specified email domains.

This topic covers these options in the following sections:

* [Accessing Authentication Settings](#accessing)
* [Enabling SSO Providers](#sso_providers)
* [Enforcing Password Policies](#password_policy)
* [Enforcing Two Factor Authentication](#2fa)
* [Restricting Email Domains](#domain)

To modify Authentication Settings, you must be logged into Harness as a member of the Administrators User Group. For details about Harness' role-based access control, see [Managing Users and Groups (RBAC)](users-and-permissions.md).
### Accessing Authentication Settings

To open Authentication Settings, select **Continuous Security** > **Access Management**, then click the **Authentication Settings** panel.

The resulting **Authentication Settings** page will display options like those shown here (and described below):

![](./static/authentication-settings-212.png)
The **Authentication Settings** page consolidates several options from separate locations in earlier Harness versions.
### Enabling SSO Providers

In the **SSO Providers** section, you can enable Harness logins via a range of single sign-on mechanisms. Enable the **Allow login via public OAuth providers** slider to expose sliders for enabling individual [OAuth partners](single-sign-on-sso-with-oauth-2-0.md).

![](./static/authentication-settings-213.png)
Click **Add SSO Providers** to enable [SAML](single-sign-on-sso-with-saml.md)- or [LDAP-based](sso-ldap.md) logins.

![](./static/authentication-settings-214.png)
To enable a SAML or LDAP provider, you will be prompted to first disable any configured public OAuth providers. For details on all the options in this **SSO Providers** section, see [SSO Provider Overview](sso-provider-overview.md) and its linked pages.

Disabling *all* SSO login options will automatically enable [username/password-based logins](#password_policy) (described below) as a fallback authentication mechanism.
### Enforcing Password Policies

The **Allow login using Harness username/password** slider enables Harness' default, native authentication mechanism. When this is enabled, you'll see additional controls to govern the following password requirements:

* [Quality](#quality) (strength).
* [Expiration](#expiration) (refresh) period.
* [Lockout Policy](#lockout_policy) after failed logins.

#### Enforcing Password Strength

Select **Enforce password strength** to open the dialog shown below. This offers a field where you can specify and enforce minimum password length, and independent controls to require Harness passwords to include at least one uppercase letter, lowercase letter, numeral, and/or non-alphanumeric character.

![](./static/authentication-settings-216.png)
If you enforce **Have at least 1 special character**, each password must include one (or more) of the following characters: `~!@#$%^&amp;*_-+=`|\(){}[]:;&quot;'&lt;&gt;,.?/`

<!-- `~!@#$%^&*_-+=`|\(){}[]:;"'<>,.?/` -->


#### Enforcing Password Expiration

Select **Periodically expire passwords** to set an interval at which users must refresh their Harness passwords. In the same dialog, you can also set an advance notification interval.

##### Enabling Password Reset

Administrators can email password-reset links to users whose passwords have expired. To do so:

1. Select **Continuous Security** > **Access Management** > **Users**.![](./static/authentication-settings-218.png)

2. Click the More Options ⋮ menu beside the user you want to unlock, then click **Email Password Rest Link**.![](./static/authentication-settings-219.png)

3. Select **Confirm** in the resulting dialog.![](./static/authentication-settings-220.png)



#### Enforcing Lockout After Failed Logins

Select **Enforce lockout policy** to open the dialog shown below. It offers independent controls over the lockout trigger (how many failed logins), lockout time, and notifications to locked-out users and to Harness [user groups](../../account/manage-notegroups/notification-groups.md).

![](./static/authentication-settings-221.png)
Once you click **SUBMIT** in any of these dialogs, the **Password Policy** section will display the selections you've made. This example shows all restrictions enabled:

![](./static/authentication-settings-222.png)
To change individual settings, click any panel's More Options ⋮ menu, then click **Edit**. This reopens the corresponding dialog.

##### Unlocking Locked Users

Administrators can manually unlock users without waiting for the configured login clearing period to elapse. To do so:

1. Select **Continuous Security** > **Access Management** > **Users**.![](./static/authentication-settings-224.png)

2. Click the More Options ⋮ menu beside the user you want to unlock, then click **Unlock**.![](./static/authentication-settings-225.png)

3. In the resulting dialog, confirm that you want to unlock this user.![](./static/authentication-settings-226.png)



### Enforcing Two Factor Authentication

If you enable options in the page's bottom **Security Options** section, these options will govern all logins—whether through [SSO providers](#sso_providers) or through [Harness username/password](#password_policy) combinations.

![](./static/authentication-settings-227.png)
Select **Enforce two factor authentication** if you choose to set up account-wide 2FA. For details, see [Two Factor Authentication](login-settings.md#enforce-2fa-account-wide).


### Restricting Email Domains

Select **Restrict users to email domains** if you want to to whitelist (allowlist) only certain domains as usable in login credentials. In the dialog shown below, build your allowlist by simply typing your chosen domains into the **Domains** multi-select field.

![](./static/authentication-settings-228.png)
After you click **SUBMIT**, the **Security Options** panel will confirm the domains you've whitelisted:

![](./static/authentication-settings-229.png)
Remember that your resulting allowlist will impose a further filter on logins to Harness via both SSO providers and Harness username/passwords.

As with the [Password Policy](#password_policy) settings, you can modify your domain selections by clicking the More Options ⋮ menu, then clicking **Edit** to reopen the dialog.
