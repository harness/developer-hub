Harness SaaS Delegates only need outbound access to the Harness domain name (most commonly, **app.harness.io)** and, optionally, to **logging.googleapis.com**.

The URL logging.googleapis.com is used to provide logs to Harness support.

### Harness Manager

Users of the Harness Manager browser client need access to **app.harness.io** and **static.harness.io**. This is not a Harness Delegate requirement. It's simply for users to use the browser-based Harness Manager.

### Vanity URL

If you are using a Harness vanity URL, like **mycompany.harness.io**, you can whitelist it also.

### Whitelist Harness SaaS IPs

The following list is optional. You can whitelist these IPs if needed.


```
35.201.91.229  
162.159.134.64  
162.159.135.64  
2606:4700:7::a29f:8640  
2606:4700:7::a29f:8740
```
Harness will not change IPs without 30 days notice to all customers. If a security emergency requires a change, all customers will be notified.
