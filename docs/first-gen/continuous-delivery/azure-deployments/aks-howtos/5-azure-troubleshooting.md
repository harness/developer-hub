This content is for Harness [FirstGen](../../../../getting-started/harness-first-gen-vs-harness-next-gen.md). Switch to [NextGen](../../../../continuous-delivery/onboard-cd/cd-quickstarts/azure-cd-quickstart.md).The following troubleshooting steps should help address common issues.

#### Failed to pull image

Kubernetes might fail to pull the Docker image set up in your Service:


```
Event  : Pod   harness-example-deployment-6b8794c59-2z99v   Error: ErrImagePull   Failed  
Event  : Pod   harness-example-deployment-6b8794c59-2z99v   Failed to pull image   
"harnessexample.azurecr.io/todolist-sample:latest": rpc error: code = Unknown desc = Error response from daemon:   
Get https://harnessexample.azurecr.io/v2/todolist-sample/manifests/latest: unauthorized: authentication required   Failed
```
This is caused by the `createImagePullSecret` setting set to `false` in the values.yaml file in Service **Manifests**.

To fix this, set the `createImagePullSecret` setting set to `true`, as described in [Modify ImagePullSecret](2-service-and-artifact-source.md#modify-image-pull-secret):


```
createImagePullSecret: true
```
