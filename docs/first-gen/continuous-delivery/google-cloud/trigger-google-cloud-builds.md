Currently, this feature is behind the feature flag `GCB_CI_SYSTEM`. Contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io) to enable the feature.Google Cloud Build (GCB) can import source code from a variety of repositories or cloud storage spaces, execute a build to your specifications, and produce artifacts such as Docker containers or Java archives.

Harness GCB integration lets you do the following:

* Run GCB builds as part of your Harness Workflow.
* Run GCB builds using config files inline or in remote Git repos.
* Execute GCB Triggers, including substituting specific variables at build time.

### Before You Begin

* If you are new to GCB, review [Overview of Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/overview) and [Quickstart: Build](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/quickstart-build) from Google.
* [Add Google Cloud Platform Cloud Provider](../../firstgen-platform/account/manage-connectors/add-google-cloud-platform-cloud-provider.md)
* [Add Source Repo Providers](../../firstgen-platform/account/manage-connectors/add-source-repo-providers.md)
* [Workflows](../model-cd-pipeline/workflows/workflow-configuration.md)

### Review: Harness GCB Integration

You can add the Google Cloud Build step to any Workflow type and Workflow section.The following steps describe, in general, the lifecycle of a GCB build with Harness:

1. In GCB:
	1. Prepare your application code and any needed assets.
	2. Create a build config file in JSON format.
	3. For GCB triggers, create a trigger in Google Cloud Build.
2. In Harness:
	1. Connect Harness to your Google Cloud Platform account.
	2. Connect Harness to your Git account if you will be using remote GCB build config files.
	3. Add a GCB step to your Workflow.
	4. Target your GCB build using one of the following:
		1. Inline config file.
		2. Remote config file.
		3. GCB trigger.
	5. Deploy the Workflow to execute the GCB build.

Let's set it up.

### Step 1: Connect to Google Cloud Platform

1. Connect Harness to your GCP account by setting up a Harness [Google Cloud Platform Cloud Provider](../../firstgen-platform/account/manage-connectors/add-google-cloud-platform-cloud-provider.md).  
You set up this connection using a [GCP service account key file](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys) (in JSON format).
2. Ensure that the service account used has the [**GCB Cloud Build Editor role**](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/iam-roles-permissions#predefined_roles).

For a detailed description of the permissions used, see the following section.

#### Required GCP Permissions

GCB roles and permissions are described in [IAM Roles and permissions](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/iam-roles-permissions) from Google.Harness uses get, create, and list [permissions](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/iam-roles-permissions). Here is how these permissions map to Harness GCB operations:

* Run inline builds: `cloudbuild.builds.create`
* Run remote builds: `cloudbuild.builds.create`
* Run triggers: `cloudbuild.builds.create`
* Fetch logs: `cloudbuild.builds.get`
* List triggers: `cloudbuild.builds.list` (if you are entering the trigger name manually, this is not needed)

If you create your own role, ensure that it includes these permissions.

### Step 2: Add Google Cloud Build Step

You can add the Google Cloud Build step to any Workflow type and Workflow section.

1. In your Harness Workflow, in any section, click **Add Step**.
2. Select **Google Cloud Build**, and click **Next**.
3. In **Google Cloud Provider**, select the Harness Google Cloud Provider you set up earlier. See [Add Google Cloud Platform Cloud Provider](../../firstgen-platform/account/manage-connectors/add-google-cloud-platform-cloud-provider.md).You can turn this setting into a deployment runtime parameter by clicking the template button **[T]**. This will create a [Workflow variable](../model-cd-pipeline/workflows/add-workflow-variables-new-template.md) for the setting. When you deploy this Workflow, you can enter the option for the setting.
4. Complete the step using the following settings.

### Option 1: Inline JSON Build Spec

You can enter an inline JSON build configuration just like you would in a Cloud Build config file.

1. In **Build Specification**, click **Inline**.

Enter your build config spec in JSON. For example:


```
{  
  "steps": [  
    {  
      "name": "gcr.io/cloud-builders/git",  
      "args": ["clone", "https://github.com/john-smith/gcb.git", "."]  
    },  
    {  
      "name": "gcr.io/cloud-builders/gradle",  
      "entrypoint": "gradle",  
      "args": ["build"]  
    },  
    {  
      "name": "gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker",  
      "args": ["build", "-t", "gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/v-image", "--build-arg=JAR_FILE=build/libs/playground-0.0.1.jar", "."]  
    }  
  ],  
  "options": {"logStreamingOption": "STREAM_ON"},  
  "images": ["gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/v-image"]  
}
```
Harness uses the Cloud Build API [Build resource](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/api/reference/rest/v1/projects.builds) to process the build config spec.

### Option 2: Pulling Build Spec from Git Repo

In this option, you specify the repo where your build config file and its related files are located.

1. Ensure you have set up a Harness Source Repo Provider that points to the Git repo containing your build config file. See [Add Source Repo Providers](../../firstgen-platform/account/manage-connectors/add-source-repo-providers.md).
2. In **Build Specification**, select **Remote**.
3. In **Source Repository**, select the Source Repro Provider that connects to your build config file repo.You can turn this setting into a deployment runtime parameter by clicking the template button **[T]**. This will create a [Workflow variable](../model-cd-pipeline/workflows/add-workflow-variables-new-template.md) for the setting. When you deploy this Workflow, you can enter the option for the setting.
4. In **Commit ID**, select **Latest from Branch** or **Specific Commit ID**.
5. Enter the branch name or commit ID. Both of these settings allow Harness variables, such as [Workflow variables](../model-cd-pipeline/workflows/add-workflow-variables-new-template.md).  
When you set up the Source Repo Provider, you entered in a branch name. The branch name you enter in the **Google Cloud Build** step **Branch Name** overrides that setting.
6. In **File Path**, enter the full path from the root of the repo to the build config file. If the build file location in the repo is **https://github.com/john-smith/gcb/cloudbuild.json**, then the file is at the repo root and you would just enter **cloudbuild.json** in **File Path**.

### Option 3: Execute Existing GCB Trigger

Select this option if you have created a [Cloud Build trigger](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/automating-builds/create-manage-triggers) for your Cloud Build and you want to execute it in your Workflow.

1. In **Build Specification**, click **Trigger**.
2. In **Trigger Name**, select the name of the Cloud Build trigger you want to execute.You can enter the name of an existing variable expression in this setting. For example, if you created the [Workflow variable](../model-cd-pipeline/workflows/add-workflow-variables-new-template.md) `triggerName`, you can enter `${workflow.variables.triggerName}`. The variable expression should refer to a [Workflow variable](../model-cd-pipeline/workflows/add-workflow-variables-new-template.md) or other available [Harness variable](../../firstgen-platform/techref-category/variables/variables.md). When you deploy this Workflow, you can enter the option for the setting.
3. In **Trigger Type**, select one of the following:
	1. **Branch Name:** Set your trigger to start a build using commits from a particular branch.
	2. **Tag Name:** Set your trigger to start a build using commits that contain a particular tag.
	3. **Commit SHA:** Set your trigger to start a build using an explicit commit SHA.  
	All of these settings allow Harness variables, such as [Workflow variables](../model-cd-pipeline/workflows/add-workflow-variables-new-template.md).

#### Substitutions

GCB lets you use substitutions for specific variables at build time. You can do this in the Harness Google Cloud Build step, also.

See [Substituting variable values](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/configuring-builds/substitute-variable-values) from Google.1. In **Substitutions**, click **Add**.
2. In **Name**, enter the name of the variable you want to make a substitution on.  
For example, if your Cloud Build config file uses `name: ${_NAME}`, you would enter **\_Name**.
3. In **Value**, enter the value to substitute for the variable.

This is often used for tagging. For example, if your config file has `tags: ["${_TAG1}", "${_TAG2}"]`, you would create substitutions with the names **\_TAG1** and **\_TAG2** and then enter the tag values in **Value**.

### Step 3: Execution Settings

#### Timeout

The timeout period determines how long to wait for the step to complete. When the timeout expires, it is considered a workflow failure and the workflow [Failure Strategy](../model-cd-pipeline/workflows/define-workflow-failure-strategy-new-template.md) is initiated.

#### Execute with previous steps

Select this checkbox to run this step in parallel with the previous Workflow step(s).

#### Wait interval before execution

Set how long the deployment process should wait before executing the step.

### Option 4: Use Output Variables

Harness provides the following information about the builds it executes:

* Activity ID: `activityId`
* Build Url: `buildUrl`
* Build# `buildNo`
* Tags: `tags`
* Status: `buildStatus`
* Build Name: `name`
* Created At: `createTime`
* Substitutions (an array of key-value pairs): `substitutions`
* Logs URL: `logUrl`
* Images: `images`
* Bucket: `artifactLocation`
* Artifacts (an array of artifacts): `artifacts`

You create an output variable in the Google Cloud Build step, and then you can reference each build output item in a subsequent [Shell Script](../model-cd-pipeline/workflows/capture-shell-script-step-output.md) step.

1. Select **Build output in the Context**.
2. In **Name**, enter a name for the output variable, such as **gcb**.
3. In **Scope**, select **Workflow**, **Pipeline**, or **Phase** (Canary or Multi-Service Workflows only). Scope is used to avoid variable name conflicts and to make the output information available across Workflows in a Pipeline.

For example, if I create the variable **gcb**, in a subsequent Shell Script step, I could enter the following:


```
echo "Activity ID: ${gcb.activityId}"  
echo "Build Url: ${gcb.buildUrl}"  
echo "Build# ${gcb.buildNo}"  
echo "Tags: ${gcb.tags}"  
echo "Status: ${gcb.buildStatus}"  
echo "Build Name: ${gcb.name}"  
echo "Created At: ${gcb.createTime}"  
echo "Substitutions: ${gcb.substitutions}"  
echo "Logs URL: ${gcb.logUrl}"  
echo "Images: ${gcb.images}"  
echo "Bucket: ${gcb.artifactLocation}"  
echo "Artifacts: ${gcb.artifacts}"
```
When the Workflow is deployed, the Harness Deployments page will show the output information in the Shell Script step:


```
Activity ID: up9p7jG6SoCAIvwyv8sE6A  
Build Url: https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/builds/8ba3539e-658e-44bb-8624-d34638264f9b

Images: [gcr.io/project-123/v-image]  
Bucket: gs://gcb-playgound/  
Artifacts: [build/libs/playground-0.0.1.jar]
```
### Step 4: Deploy Workflow

When you are finished setting up the Google Cloud Build step, and any other steps, deploy your Workflow.

The Google Cloud Build step **Details** displays information about the build, including a build URL you can click to open the build in the GCB console:

### Limitations

Harness only supports the use of JSON in inline and remote build config files. If you use a GCB trigger in the Google Cloud Build step, the config file it uses can be either YAML or JSON.
