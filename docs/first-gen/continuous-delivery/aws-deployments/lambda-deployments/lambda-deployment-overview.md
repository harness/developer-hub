This content is for Harness [FirstGen](../../../../getting-started/harness-first-gen-vs-harness-next-gen.md). Switch to [NextGen](../../../../continuous-delivery/onboard-cd/cd-quickstarts/serverless-lambda-cd-quickstart.md).Harness has first-class support for AWS Lambda deployments, enabling you to deploy your functions without having to worry about compute constraints or complexity.

See the How-tos for connecting AWS Lambda and creating AWS Lambda deployments.
