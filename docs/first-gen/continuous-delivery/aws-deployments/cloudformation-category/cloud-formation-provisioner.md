This content is for Harness [FirstGen](../../../../getting-started/harness-first-gen-vs-harness-next-gen.md). Switch to [NextGen](https://docs.harness.io/article/vynj4hxt98).Harness has first-class support for [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) as an infrastructure provisioner.

See the following CloudFormation How-tos:

* [Set Up Your Harness Account for CloudFormation](cloud-formation-account-setup.md)
* [Add CloudFormation Templates](add-cloud-formation-templates.md)
* [Map CloudFormation Infrastructure](map-cloud-formation-infrastructure.md)
* [Provision using CloudFormation Create Stack](provision-cloudformation-create-stack.md)
* [Using CloudFormation Outputs in Workflow Steps](using-cloudformation-outputs-in-workflow-steps.md)
* [Remove Provisioned Infra with CloudFormation Delete Stack](cloudformation-delete-stack.md)

For a conceptual overview of Harness CloudFormation integration, see [CloudFormation Provisioning with Harness](../../concepts-cd/deployment-types/cloud-formation-provisioning-with-harness.md).

**Deployment Strategies Supported** — For most deployments, Harness Infrastructure Provisioners are only supported in Canary and Multi-Service types. For AMI/ASG and ECS deployments, Infrastructure Provisioners are also supported in Blue/Green deployments.
