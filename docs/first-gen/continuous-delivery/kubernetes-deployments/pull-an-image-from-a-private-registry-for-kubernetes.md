This content is for Harness [FirstGen](../../../getting-started/harness-first-gen-vs-harness-next-gen.md). Switch to [NextGen](/docs/category/kubernetes).

Typically, If the Docker artifact source is in a private registry, Harness has access to that registry using the credentials set up in the Harness [Add Artifact Servers](../../firstgen-platform/account/manage-connectors/configuring-artifact-server.md).

In some cases, your Kubernetes cluster might not have the permissions needed to access a private Docker registry. For these cases, the default values.yaml file in Service **Manifests** section contains `dockercfg: ${artifact.source.dockerconfig}` . This key will import the credentials from the Docker credentials file in the artifact.

### Before You Begin

Ensure you have reviewed and set up the following:

* [Kubernetes Deployments Overview](../concepts-cd/deployment-types/kubernetes-overview.md)
* [Add Container Images for Kubernetes Deployments](add-container-images-for-kubernetes-deployments.md)

### Step 1: Use the dockercfg Value

1. In your Harness Kubernetes Service, in **Manifests**, click **values.yaml**.
2. Verify that `dockercfg` key exists, and uses the `${artifact.source.dockerconfig}` expression to obtain the credentials:

  ```
  dockercfg: ${artifact.source.dockerconfig}
  ```
2. Click the **deployment.yaml** file.
3. Verify that the Secret object is inside an `if` argument using `dockercfg` and the `{{.Values.dockercfg}}` value:

  ```
  {{- if .Values.dockercfg}}  
  apiVersion: v1  
  kind: Secret  
  metadata:  
    name: {{.Values.name}}-dockercfg  
    annotations:  
      harness.io/skip-versioning: "true"  
  data:  
    .dockercfg: {{.Values.dockercfg}}  
  type: kubernetes.io/dockercfg  
  ---  
  {{- end}}
  ```
With these requirements met, the cluster import the credentials from the Docker credentials file in the artifact.

### Notes

* Any secrets in the manifest are sanitized when they are displayed in the deployment logs. See [Secrets and Log Sanitization](../../firstgen-platform/techref-category/techref-security/secrets-and-log-sanitization.md).
* When you are using a public repo, the `dockercfg: ${artifact.source.dockerconfig}` in values.yaml is ignored by Harness. You do not need to remove it.
* If you want to use a private repo and no imagePullSecret, then set `dockercfg` to empty in values.yaml.
* **Legacy imagePullSecret Method** â€” Previously, Harness used a `createImagePullSecret` value in values.yaml that could be set to `true` or `false`, and `dockercfg: ${artifact.source.dockerconfig}` to obtain the credentials. If `createImagePullSecret` was set to `true`, the following default Secret object in deployment.yaml would be used:


```
{{- if .Values.createImagePullSecret}}  
apiVersion: v1  
kind: Secret  
metadata:  
  name: {{.Values.name}}-dockercfg  
  annotations:  
    harness.io/skip-versioning: "true"  
data:  
  .dockercfg: {{.Values.dockercfg}}  
type: kubernetes.io/dockercfg  
---  
{{- end}}
```
This legacy method is still supported for existing Services that use it, but the current method of using the default values.yaml and deployment.yaml files is recommended.
