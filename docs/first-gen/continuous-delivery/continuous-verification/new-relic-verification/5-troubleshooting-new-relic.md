The following error message can occur when testing the New Relic verification step in your workflow:


```
NEWRELIC_CONFIGURATION_ERROR: Error while saving New Relic configuration. No node with name ${hostName} found reporting to new relic
```
Here is the error in the Expression for Host Name popover:

#### Cause

The expression in the **Expression for Host/Container name** field is incorrect. Typically, this occurs when the wrong hostName label is selected to create the expression in the **Expression for Host/Container name** field.

#### Solution

Following the steps in [Guide From Example](#guide_from_example) again to select the correct expression. Ensure that the **hostName** label selected is under the **host** section of the YAML.
