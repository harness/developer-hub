Harness analyzes application log events to help customers detect anomalies and verify their production deployments. To do this, our algorithms have been based on textual similarity and occurrence frequencies. Harness has native integrations for popular log aggregation tools like Splunk, ELK, and Sumo Logic.

#### Dynatrace

 [Harness Extends Continuous Verification To Dynatrace](https://harness.io/2018/02/harness-extends-continuous-verification-dynatrace/)

One of our early customers, Build.com, used to verify production deployments with 5-6 team leads manually analyzing monitoring data and log files. This process took each team lead 60 minutes, and occurred 3 times a week. That’s 1,080 minutes, or 18 hours, of team lead time spent on verification. With Harness, Build.com reduced verification time to just 15 minutes, and also enabled automatic rollback to occur in production.
