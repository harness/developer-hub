You can stop all of your Harness Triggers from executing deployments using Harness Deployment Freeze.

Deployment Freeze is a Harness Governance feature that stops all Harness deployments, including their Triggers. A deployment freeze helps ensure stability during periods of low engineering and support activity, such as holidays, trade shows, or company events.

For details on how to add and enable a deployment freeze window, see [Deployment Freeze](https://docs.harness.io/article/wscbhd20ca-deployment-freeze).
