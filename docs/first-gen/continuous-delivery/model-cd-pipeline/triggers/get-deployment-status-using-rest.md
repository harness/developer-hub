For [Build Workflows](../../concepts-cd/deployment-types/ci-cd-with-the-build-workflow.md) or a  [Build and Deploy Pipeline](../../concepts-cd/deployment-types/artifact-build-and-deploy-pipelines-overview.md), you can trigger deployments in response to a Git event using Webhooks. This is described in [Trigger Deployments using Git Events](trigger-a-deployment-on-git-event.md).

Once you have created a Harness [On Webhook Event](trigger-a-deployment-on-git-event.md) Trigger, Harness creates a Manual Trigger for it.

You can do the following with a Manual Trigger:

* Start a deployment using a URL provided by Harness. See [Trigger a Deployment using a URL](trigger-a-deployment-using-a-url.md).
* Start a deployment using a curl command. See [Trigger a Deployment using cURL](trigger-a-deployment-using-c-url.md).
* Use a REST call to get deployment status.

In this topic, we will cover using a REST call to get deployment status.

### Before You Begin

* [API Keys](../../../firstgen-platform/security/access-management-howtos/api-keys.md)
* [Build Workflows](../../concepts-cd/deployment-types/ci-cd-with-the-build-workflow.md)
* [Build and Deploy Pipeline](../../concepts-cd/deployment-types/artifact-build-and-deploy-pipelines-overview.md)
* [Add a Service](../setup-services/service-configuration.md)
* [Workflows](../workflows/workflow-configuration.md)
* [Add Environment](../environments/environment-configuration.md)
* [Create a Pipeline](../pipelines/pipeline-configuration.md)

### Step 1: Create Harness API Key

To use a REST call to get deployment status, you need to generate a Harness API key first.

The API key is used in the cURL command GET call for deployment status, described below.

1. In Harness Manager, click **Security**, and then click **Access Management**.
2. Click **API Keys**.
3. Click **Add API Key**.
4. In the **Add API Key** settings, enter a name and select your User Group.
5. Click **Submit**. The new API key is created.
6. To copy the API key, first click the Eye icon to reveal the key's value.
7. Next, click the Copy icon beside the key. This copies the key's value to your clipboard.
8. To delete an API key, click the **Delete** icon.

### Step 2: Show cURL Command

The cURL command for executing a deployment is provided by every Trigger of type **On Webhook Event**.

In **Triggers**, locate the Trigger you want run.

Click **Manual Trigger**.

In the **Manual Trigger** settings, click **Show Curl Command**. The cURL command is displayed.

When you created a Trigger, if you selected values for parameters that are represented by placeholders in the cURL command, you do not need to add values for the cURL placeholders.

If you add values for the cURL placeholders, you will override manual settings in the Trigger.

This is also true for Triggers that execute templated Workflows and Pipelines. If you create a Trigger that executes a templated Workflow or Pipeline, you can select values for the templated settings in the Trigger, but you can still override them in the cURL command.

Let's look at a placeholder example:


```
curl -X POST -H 'content-type: application/json' \  
 --url https://app.harness.io/api/webhooks/xxxxxx \  
 -d '{"application":"xxxxxx","artifacts":[{"service":"micro-service","buildNumber":"micro-service_BUILD_NUMBER_PLACE_HOLDER"}]}'
```
For `service`, enter the name of the Harness Service.

For `buildNumber`, enter the artifact build number from the Artifact History in the Service.

For example:


```
curl -X POST -H 'content-type: application/json' \  
 --url https://app.harness.io/api/webhooks/xxxxxx \  
 -d '{"application":"xxxxxx","artifacts":[{"service":"Service-Example","buildNumber":"1.17.8-perl"}]}'
```
### Step 3: Run cURL Command

Once you have replaced the placeholders, run the cURL command.

The output will be something like this (private information has been replaced with **xxxxxx**):


```
{  
 "requestId":"-tcjMxQ_RJuDUktfl4AY0A",  
 "status":"RUNNING",  
 "error":null,  
 "uiUrl":"https://app.harness.io/#/account/xxxxxx/app/xxxxxx/pipeline-execution/-xxxxxx/workflow-execution/xxxxxx/details",  
 "apiUrl":"https://app.harness.io/gateway/api/external/v1/executions/-xxxxxx/status?accountId=xxxxxx&appId=xxxxxx"  
 }  

```
The **uiUrl** can be used directly in a browser. **apiUrl** can be used to track deployment status programmatically, such as using a REST call.

### Step 4: Use the API URL

To get deployment status using a REST call (in this example, cURL), use the following cURL command, replacing **API\_URL** with the URL from **apiUrl**, and **API\_KEY** with the API key you generated in Harness:


```
curl -X GET -H 'X-Api-Key:**API\_KEY**' --url "**API\_URL**"
```
For example (private information has been replaced with **xxxxxx**):


```
curl -X GET -H 'X-Api-Key:a1b2c3' --url "https://app.harness.io/gateway/api/external/v1/executions/xxxxxx/status?accountId=xxxxxx&appId=xxxxxx"
```
The output from the curl command will contain the status of the deployment. These are the same status messages you can see in the **Continuous Deployments** dashboard, such as: 


```
{"status":"SUCCESS"}, {"status":"FAILED"}, {"status":"ABORTED"}, {"status":"QUEUED"}.
```
### Configure As Code

To see how to configure the settings in this topic using YAML, configure the settings in the UI first, and then click the **YAML** editor button.
