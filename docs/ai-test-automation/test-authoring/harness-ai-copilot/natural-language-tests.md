### How to author Harness AI tasks  during interactive authoring ?

Here we simply instruct Harness AI to perform a specific task and it figures out the required steps. Here in the example below we have asked Copilot to deposit $40 to the savings account&#x20;

The Copilot parses the steps and then performs the required action without any supervision. Once the task is done, Copilot returns back the control to the user and the user can either ask the Copilot to proceed or continue to author the test interactively.&#x20;

Here we see the steps on the left that Copilot had recorded to perform the task assigned "Deposit $40 to savings account"

Here is a recorded demonstration of how Copilot transfers money from Checking to Savings account
