Harness AI Test Automation (AIT) automatically generates the test step descriptions as you interact with the browser. But often the step descriptions can be very cryptic and not easily comprehensible. Hence Harness AIT allows you to add your own step descriptions so that any one can read the test and fully understand the intent of the test and its individual steps.&#x20;
