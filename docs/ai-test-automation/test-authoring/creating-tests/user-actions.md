# User Actions
## Overview

Harness AI Test Automation transforms testing with its intuitive interactive authoring experience. As you naturally interact with your application, the system intelligently captures each action and converts them into robust test steps, no coding required. 

This document explores all available user actions that can be added using the *"+ Add step"* button during test creation, including clicks, text inputs, selections, navigation, keyboard interactions, and more specialized commands like waits and viewport adjustments. 

Each action can be enhanced with assertions to validate expected behavior, parametrized for flexibility, and seamlessly integrated into CI/CD pipelines. Understanding these powerful actions will help you create comprehensive test coverage for your applications, whether you're building simple workflows or complex test scenarios.

## Supported Actions


### API Call

Sends HTTP requests to external APIs directly from your test. This action allows you to integrate with backend services, validate API responses, and use API data in your tests without leaving the test environment.

> This is useful for setting up test data, verifying backend operations, or retrieving data that can be used in subsequent test steps.

#### Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Method Type** | HTTP method to use (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, etc.) |
| **URL** | The endpoint URL to send the request to |
| **Headers** | JSON object containing request headers |
| **Body** | JSON object containing the request body for POST/PUT/PATCH requests |
| **Parameter name for Response body** | Name of the parameter where the API response will be stored |
| **Scope** | Determines where the response parameter is stored: `Run time`, `App`, or `Test Suite` |


<br/>

### Click


:::tip
For a basic click, no additional configuration is required. It allows you to explicitly specify which element to click when multiple elements might match the selector, ensuring precision in complex UI interactions. So just simply click on the element you want to select in the step.
:::

Click on any place in the viewport to register a click command as a test step. No additional action required.

### DB Query

Executes a SQL query against a database and captures the results as parameters. This action allows you to integrate database interactions directly into your test flow, enabling data validation and dynamic test data generation.

> This action requires proper database credentials and connection information. Ensure your database is accessible from the test environment.

<br/>

### File Upload

Uploads a file to the selected input element on a webpage. Specify the absolute or relative path to the file you want to upload, and select the appropriate file input element in your application.
The file input element where you want to upload the file. Click on the appropriate file input element in your application.

> You can upload files from your local system or from your test resources directory. This will be hosted on a S3 bucket and the file path will be used in the test.

<br/>

### Select

Select a value from dropdown menus, select boxes, or other list interfaces. This action simulates a user choosing an option from a dropdown, allowing your test to interact with form selection elements. The system will capture both the display text and underlying value of the selected option. 


<DocImage 
  path={require('./static/select.png')}
  alt="Select"
  title="Select"
  width="60%"
/>

:::info
Click, Write, and Select are automatically detected by Harness AI Test Automation. Users need not have to select these commands from a list.
:::

<br/>

### Set Parameter

<DocImage
  path={require('./static/set-parameter.png')}
  alt="Set Parameter"
  title="Set Parameter"
  width="60%"
/>

<br/>

### Set Checkbox

Toggles a checkbox to the selected state. Use this action to check or uncheck form elements without simulating a click action.
Determines whether to check or uncheck the element. Set to `true` to check the element or `false` to uncheck it.
 It works on the checkbox element you want to manipulate. Click on the appropriate element in your application.

<DocImage
  path={require('./static/set-checkbox.png')}
  alt="set-checkbox"
  title="set-checkbox"
  width="60%"
/>

<br/>

This action sets the selected radio button to `true` while automatically setting all other radio buttons in the same group to `false`.
It works on the radio button element you want to select. Click on the appropriate element in your application.

<DocImage
  path={require('./static/radio.png')}
  alt="set-radio-button"
  title="set-radio-button"
  width="60%"
/>

<br/>

### Set Parameter from Target

<DocImage
  path={require('./static/set-parameter-from-target.png')}
  alt="Set Parameter from Target"
  title="Set Parameter from Target"
  width="60%"
/>


#### Options

<br/>

### Viewport

Adjusts the screen dimensions for testing responsive designs. Set the width and height of the screen to emulate different device sizes.



<DocImage
  path={require('./static/viewport.png')}
  alt="viewport"
  width="50%"
/>

<br/>

### Wait for Time

Creates a timed pause in test execution. Specify the duration in milliseconds to delay the test before proceeding to the next step. This is useful for waiting for animations to complete, giving time for background processes to finish, or creating deliberate pauses in your test flow.

<DocImage
  path={require('./static/wait-for-time.png')}
  alt="Wait for Time"
  title="Wait for Time"
  width="50%"
/>

<br/>

### Write

Write text in any input field, text area, or editable element in your application. This action simulates a user typing content into a field, supporting both static text and dynamic parameters. It works with standard HTML inputs, WYSIWYG editors, rich text fields, and most other editable interfaces. 

>Can be parameterized directly using available parameters or by creating new ones by clicking on the `{}` button 

<DocImage path={require('./static/write.png')} 
alt="write"
title="Write"
width="60%"
/>


:::tip
For a basic write action, simply specify the text you want to input and select the appropriate input field based on your selection.
