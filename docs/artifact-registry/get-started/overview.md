**Harness Artifact Registry** is a centralized registry designed to store, manage, and organize software artifacts—such as binaries, container images, libraries, or other build outputs—that are essential for development and deployment processes. It provides developers with a secure and efficient way to store, version, and distribute these artifacts, while supporting key capabilities like access control, dependency management, and vulnerability scanning to ensure reliability and security across software delivery pipelines.  

## Key Features

- **Universal Artifact Management**:
    - Manage and store all artifact types in a single, unified platform.
    - Generic file support for storing raw or custom artifacts.

- **Advanced Search and Insights**: 
    - Use AI-powered semantic search to quickly find artifacts using contextual information. 
    - Gain visibility into usage patterns and artifact consumption across teams.

- **Upstream Proxy Support**: 
    - Proxy and cache open-source software (OSS) dependencies to reduce latency and ensure availability. 
    - Simplify dependency management while controlling access to external repositories.

- **Fine-Grained Access Control**
    - Role-based access control (RBAC) to secure artifacts at every stage of their lifecycle.
    - Enforce policies for artifact creation, usage, and deletion.

- **Built-In Vulnerability Scanning**
    - Detect vulnerabilities in stored artifacts automatically with built in integrations with the [Harness Supply Chain Security module](/docs/software-supply-chain-assurance/).
    - Stay compliant with security standards and ensure artifact integrity.

- **Artifact Cleanup Policies**
    - Automate artifact cleanup to optimize storage and reduce costs.
    - Define rules to retain only the artifacts you need based on age, usage, or tags.

- **End-to-End Governance**
    - Comprehensive tracking of artifact history, from creation to retirement.
    - Ensure compliance with enterprise standards through customizable policies.
