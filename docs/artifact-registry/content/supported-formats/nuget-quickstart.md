## Configure an Upstream Proxy (Optional)
An upstream proxy allows your registry to fetch NuGet packages from external sources if they are not available locally.

:::info upstream proxy caching
If a NuGet package isnâ€™t found in your Harness registry, the upstream proxy can fetch it from an external source like NuGet.org, helping to reduce duplication and ensure reliable access to public packages.

## Publish & Install NuGet Packages
### Authenticate the CLI with the Harness Registry
After creating your new NuGet registry, you will need to set up a client to authenticate with the registry.
1. In your Harness NuGet Artifact Registry, click **Setup Client**.
2. Click **Generate token** to generate a new identity token for CLI access.
3. Run the following command to add the Harness registry as a package source:
```bash
nuget sources add -Name harness \
  -Source https://pkg.harness.io/pkg/<account-id>/<nuget-registry-name>/nuget/index.json \
  -Username <username> -Password <TOKEN>
```
:::info NuGet V2 Client
For NuGet V2 clients, use the following URL:
```bash
https://pkg.harness.io/pkg/<account-id>/<nuget-registry-name>/nuget/
```
:::

### Publish a package
Publish your package with the following command:
```bash
nuget push <PACKAGE_FILE> -Source harness
```

### Install a package
Install your package with the following command:
```bash
nuget install <ARTIFACT_NAME> -Version <VERSION> -Source harness
```

By following this guide, you can publish and install NuGet packages between your local environment and the Harness registry.
