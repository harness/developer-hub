### Continuous Deployment

Select the tutorial for the platform you want to use to deploy.

* [Kubernetes Deployment Tutorial](../continuous-delivery/onboard-cd/cd-quickstarts/kubernetes-cd-quickstart.md) shows you how to create a CD Pipeline that deploys a publicly available Docker image and manifest to your target cluster.
* [Helm Chart Deployment Tutorial](../continuous-delivery/onboard-cd/cd-quickstarts/helm-cd-quickstart.md) shows you how to create a CD Pipeline that uses a Helm chart to deploy a publicly available Docker image to your target cluster.
* [Kustomize Deployment Tutorial](../continuous-delivery/onboard-cd/cd-quickstarts/kustomize-quickstart.md) shows you how to create a CD Pipeline that uses a kustomization to deploy multiple variants of a simple public Hello World server.
* [Azure ACR to AKS Deployment Tutorial](../continuous-delivery/onboard-cd/cd-quickstarts/azure-cd-quickstart.md) shows you how to create a CD Pipeline that deploys your ACR image to your target AKS cluster.
* [Azure Web Apps Tutorial](../continuous-delivery/onboard-cd/cd-quickstarts/azure-web-apps-tutorial.md) deploy a Docker image or non-containerized artifact for your Azure Web App. You can deploy to source and target deployment slots, and perform traffic shifting.
* [Serverless Lambda Deployment Tutorial](../continuous-delivery/onboard-cd/cd-quickstarts/serverless-lambda-cd-quickstart.md) shows you how to deploy a Serverless Lambda application to AWS Lambda using Harness.
* [ECS deployment tutorial](../continuous-delivery/onboard-cd/cd-quickstarts/ecs-deployment-tutorial.md) shows you how to deploy a publicly available Docker image to your Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) cluster using a Rolling Deployment strategy.
* [Custom deployments using Deployment Templates tutorial](../continuous-delivery/onboard-cd/cd-quickstarts/custom-deployment-tutorial.md) shows you how to use Deployment Templates for non-native deployments (integrations other than those Harness supports out of the box). Deployment Templates use shell scripts to connect to target platforms, obtain target host information, and execute deployment steps.


### GitOps 

* [Harness CD GitOps Quickstart](../continuous-delivery/cd-gitops/harness-cd-git-ops-quickstart.md) shows you how to use Harness native GitOps to deploy services by syncing the Kubernetes manifests in your source repos with your target clusters.
