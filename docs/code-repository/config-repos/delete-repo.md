:::warning

Deleting a repository permanently deletes the entire repository and all contents, including files, commits, branches, and so on.

Deletion is permanent. You can't recover deleted repositories.

:::

To delete a repository in Harness Code:

1. In the Harness Code module, go to the Harness account, organization, or project that contains the repo you want to delete.

   This depends on where the repo was created or imported. For example, if it was created at the project scope, you need to navigate to the repo within that specific project.

2. Select **Repositories**.
3. Select the repository you want to delete.
4. Go to **Settings** and select **Delete**.
5. Follow the prompts to confirm deletion.
