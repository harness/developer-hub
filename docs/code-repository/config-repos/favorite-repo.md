You can mark repositories as favorites in Harness Code to quickly access them and keep your workspace organized.

To favorite a repository:

1. Go to the **Repositories** page or repository details page.
2. Click the ⭐ icon next to the repository name and visibility.
3. Once favorited, the star turns yellow, indicating it’s now in your favorites.
<DocImage path={require('./assets/star-repo.png')} />

To remove a favorite:

- Click the yellow ⭐ icon again. This removes the repository from your favorites list.

To filter and view only favorited repositories:

1. Click the ⭐ filter icon above the repository list.
2. The view will now show only your starred repositories.

Favorites are saved as user preference so your starred repositories stay consistent across sessions.
