The [Harness Code Repository module](/docs/code-repository/code-supported.md) (Code) is a source code management (SCM) tool that fosters developer collaboration and accelerates innovation while keeping security and compliance in mind. Harness Code seamlessly integrates Git-based repositories across your software delivery processes in Harness.

The Harness Code supports these features:

* [Create repositories.](./config-repos/create-repo.md)
* [Import repositories.](./config-repos/import-repo.md)
* [Collaborate and develop](/docs/category/collaborate-and-develop):
   * Clone repositories to work locally.
   * Commit, branch, and tag directly in the Harness Platform.
* Create, review, and merge [pull requests](/docs/category/pull-requests)
   * Conduct code reviews.
   * Implement status checks.
   * Define merge requirements.
   * Specify merge strategies.
* Use Harness Code repositories in your [Harness pipelines](./pipelines/codebase-from-harness-code.md), and set up [triggers](./pipelines/code-triggers.md) to automatically run pipelines based on activity in your Harness Code repositories.
* [Configure webhooks](./config-repos/webhooks.md) to integrate your repositories with third-party applications.
* [Code owners](./config-repos/rules.md)
* Notifications
* [Branch rules](./config-repos/rules.md)
