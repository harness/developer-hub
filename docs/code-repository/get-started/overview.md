The [Harness Code Repository module](/docs/code-repository/code-supported.md) (Code) is a source code management (SCM) tool that fosters developer collaboration and accelerates innovation while keeping security and compliance in mind. Harness Code seamlessly integrates Git-based repositories across your software delivery processes in Harness. Collaborative code reviews with checks and rules enforcement foster teamwork, reduce risk, and maintain code quality.
