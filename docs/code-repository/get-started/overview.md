:::note

Currently, the Code Repository module is in beta and behind a feature flag. Contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io) if you're interested in this module.

:::

The [Harness Code Repository module](/docs/code-repository/code-supported.md) (Code) is a source code management (SCM) tool that fosters developer collaboration and accelerates innovation while keeping security and compliance in mind. Harness Code seamlessly integrates Git-based repositories across your software delivery processes in Harness. Collaborative code reviews with checks and rules enforcement foster teamwork, reduce risk, and maintain code quality.

## Get started

## Access control

Access control for Harness Code is part of the [Harness Platform RBAC](/docs/platform/role-based-access-control/rbac-in-harness.md). Permissions for Harness Code include the ability to view, create/edit, delete, and push to repositories.

Harness Code includes one [built-in role](/docs/platform/role-based-access-control/add-manage-roles.md), which is the **Code Admin** role.
