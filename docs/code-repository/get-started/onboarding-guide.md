This guide explains what you need to know to get started with the Harness Code Repository module.

1. If you're new to Harness, review the [Harness Platform onboarding guide](/docs/platform/get-started/onboarding-guide) before onboarding to Code.
2. Learn about the [Harness Code key concepts](./key-concepts.md).
3. Create your first [Harness Code repository](../config-repos/create-repo.md).
4. Work with your repository as you would in other SCM tools:

   * [Clone your repo to work locally](../work-in-repos/clone-repos.md).
   * [Branch](../work-in-repos/branch.md), [commit](../work-in-repos/commit.md), and [tag](../work-in-repos/tag.md) by command line or directly in the Harness Platform.
   * [Create, review, and merge pull requests](/docs/category/pull-requests). <!-- Maintain code quality: Conduct code reviews, configure status checks, define merge requirements, and select merge strategies. -->

5. Configure your [pipelines to build, test, and deploy code from your Harness Code repos](../pipelines/codebase-from-harness-code.md).
