Pull requests (PRs) foster collaboration within your team, ensuring code changes go through required reviews, approvals, and checks before being merged to the base branch.

## Create a pull request

1. In your repository, go to **Pull Requests** and select **New Pull Request**.
2. Select the *base branch* and the *compare branch*, which is the branch that you want to merge into the base branch.
3. You can edit the **Title** and enter a **Description**.
4. If this PR is ready for review, select **Create pull request**.

   To save a PR as a draft, select the dropdown next to **Create pull request**, and then select **Create draft pull request**.

5. [Request reviews](./review-pr.md) and then [merge the PR](./merge-pr.md).
