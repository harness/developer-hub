Harness Code supports updating the target branch of an open pull request.

To change the target branch:

1. **Click the Edit Icon**  
   - In the pull request view, click the edit icon next to the PR title (the same icon used to edit the PR title).
<DocImage path={require('/docs/code-repository/pull-requests/static/change-target-branch1.png')} />
2. **Select the New Target Branch**  
   - A dropdown appears with available branches. Select the branch you want to set as the new target.
<DocImage path={require('/docs/code-repository/pull-requests/static/change-target-branch2.png')} />
3. **Save the Changes**  
   - Click the **Save** button to update the target branch for the pull request.

Once saved, the pull request will now target the newly selected branch.
