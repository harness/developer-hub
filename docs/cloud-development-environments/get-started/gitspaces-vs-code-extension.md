Harness CDE provides a seamless integration with VS Code, making it easy to connect to your Gitspaces remotely. With the Gitspaces VS Code extension, you can access and manage your Gitspaces directly within your VS Code desktop IDE. This guide will walk you through the steps to install, set up, and start developing in your Gitspaces using this extension.


## Pre-requisites 
Before starting out, ensure that you have the following:
1. VS Code Desktop installed [(Install VS Code Desktop)](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
2. Gitspaces VS Code extension installed (Refer to the steps below)
3. [Remote - SSH](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh) and [Dev containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extensions installed and enabled in VS Code Desktop

## Opening a Gitspace
Here’s how to create and open a Gitspace in VS Code:
1. Start by creating a Gitspace in your Harness UI [(check the quickstart guide for more details)](https://developer.harness.io/docs/cloud-development-environments/get-started/getting-started-with-cde)

    ![](./static/opening-gitspace-1.png)

2. After the Gitspace is created, click "Open in VS Code Desktop" from the Harness UI.

3. You’ll be asked for permission to open VS Code Desktop. Click “Open.”

4. If the Gitspaces extension isn’t installed, VS Code will prompt you to install it. Click “Allow” and “Open” to proceed.

5. VS Code may also ask you to install remote development extensions like Remote SSH and Dev Containers. Follow the prompts to add them if necessary.

6. Once all extensions are installed, you’ll be prompted to open the Gitspace inside your VS Code IDE. Click “Open.”

7. Now, you’re all set. 


## Connecting to your Gitspace
To connect to a Gitspace with VS Code Desktop, you have two options: either use an SSH key or a temporary password.
1. SSH Key:
You can create a new SSH key using `ssh-keygen` [(learn more here on how to create an SSH key)](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-Generating-Your-SSH-Public-Key). This generates a pair of keys (public and private). Copy the public key and paste it into the "SSH key" field while setting up a Gitspace (as shown in the picture below). This will enable you to establish a remote connection to the Gitspace via SSH. If you prefer not to use an SSH key, you can use the temporary password method outlined below.

2. Temporary Password:
If you do not wish to connect via an SSH key, you can use a temporary password. During Gitspace creation, simply leave the "SSH key" field blank. A temporary password will be generated automatically for the remote connection. After the Gitspace is created, you'll be redirected to VS Code desktop and prompted to copy the temporary password. Paste it and follow the prompts to establish the remote connection.

## Managing your Gitspace 
Once connected, you can easily manage your Gitspaces directly from within VS Code. Here’s how:
1. Click the Gitspaces icon in the activity bar to view all your Gitspaces in the sidebar.
Select any Gitspace to open and start working on it.

2. Use the start icon to launch a Gitspace and the stop icon to end a session. The arrow icon indicates opening a Gitspace, and the square icon stops it.

With these simple steps, you’re all set to manage and develop in your Gitspaces using the VS Code Gitspaces extension. It simplifies remote development and makes working with your Gitspaces smooth and efficient.
