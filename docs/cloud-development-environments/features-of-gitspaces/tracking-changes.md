Harness CDE is now available in public beta. To enable it on your account, contact your sales representative or reach out to the team at cde-interest@harness.io

:::

You can spin up as many Gitspaces as they want. You can also keep a track of the changes in their Gitspaces directly from the Harness UI. 

You can monitor changes in your Gitspace for the following code changes:
- Commits on your current working branch
- Staged changes (tracked files or changes added to the staging area)
- Working directory changes (tracked changes not yet added to staging)
- Untracked files (files created in the working directory but not yet staged)
- Commits on other branches
- Stashed changes

To track changes, ensure that the Gitspace is active and follow these steps:
- Open the Harness UI and navigate to the Gitspaces section.
- Any change in the Gitspace will appear in the Gitspace details, with the status updating from “No changes” to “Has Changes.”

This feature keeps one informed of all updates in your Gitspace, providing added flexibility and control over your development environment.
