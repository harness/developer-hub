Harness CDE is now available in public beta. To enable it on your account, contact your sales representative or reach out to the team at cde-interest@harness.io 

:::

With our beta plan, you receive 2,000 free minutes of Gitspace usage each month. This allows you to run and use your Gitspaces for up to 2,000 minutes at no cost. These minutes automatically renew every 30 days, resetting on the 1st of each month. 

You can easily view and track your remaining minutes directly from the Gitspaces page in the Harness UI. (as shown in the image below)

If you need additional minutes for your account, don’t hesitate to contact us at cde-interest@harness.io
