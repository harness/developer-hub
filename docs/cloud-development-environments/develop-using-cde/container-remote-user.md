This guide explains how to set up ```containerUser``` and ```remoteUser``` in your Gitspace using the properties in the ```devcontainer.json``` schema.

## What are "containerUser" and "remoteUser"?
These properties control the permissions of applications executed within containers, giving developers fine-grained control over container operations. ([Read more about the specification here.](https://containers.dev/implementors/spec/))

#### ```containerUser```
- The user with which the **development container is started**.
- It handles all processes and operations inside the container.
- This concept is native to containers.
- The default user is either the user specified in the **Docker image** or the **root user**.


#### ```remoteUser```
- The username used for **running processes inside the container**, including lifecycle scripts and any remote editor/IDE server processes.
- This concept is not native to containers.
- The default user is the same as the **containerUser**.

## How to define a containerUser?
You can define a containerUser in the following ways:
1. Using the **containerUser** Property in ```devcontainer.json```:
```
"containerUser": "root"
```
2. Using the user Argument in the **runArgs** Property in ```devcontainer.json```:
```
"runArgs": ["--user=root"]
```
3. Defining **user** during the Image Build (Image Metadata).

#### Priority Order:
If multiple definitions exist, the containerUser is set based on the following priority:
1. ```runArgs``` definition
2. ```devcontainer.json``` specification
3. Image Build

## How to define a remoteUser?
You can define a remoteUser in the following ways:
1. Using the **remoteUser** Property in ```devcontainer.json```:
```
"remoteUser": "vscode"
```
2. Defining **remoteUser** in Image Metadata.

#### Priority Order:
If multiple definitions exist, the remoteUser is set based on the following priority:
1. ```devcontainer.json``` specification
2. Image metadata

:::info
**Static Password**: A static password is maintained for the remoteUser in case the user gets locked: **Harness@123**.
:::

:::info
We assume that the user has a valid home directory. For the root user: **/root** and For non-root users: **/home/username**
:::

## Verifying the Setup
After adding this property, you can verify the setup by reviewing the **container logs** during the creation of a Gitspace via the Harness UI.
