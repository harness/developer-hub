## Prerequisites
1. Ensure you've enabled the feature flag ``CDE_HYBRID_ENABLED`` in your Harness account since Self Hosted Gitspaces are currently available behind this feature flag. Contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io) to enable this feature flag.
2. Ensure youâ€™ve read through the [Overview & Key Concepts](/docs/cloud-development-environments/self-hosted-gitspaces/fundamentals.md) of Self Hosted Gitspaces. This will help you gain a deeper understanding of the basic concepts and setup steps.
3. Please make sure you have completed the steps mentioned in [Configuring the Harness Gitspaces terraform module](/docs/cloud-development-environments/self-hosted-gitspaces/steps/gitspace-infra-terraform.md). This step is a mandatory prerequisite as this step **sets up the AWS infrastructure** and **generates the ``pool.yaml`` file** which is required to host and setup the VM Runner. 
4. Only users with **powerUserAccess** permissions as an AWS user can configure self hosted Gitspaces in your AWS infrastructure. Go to [PowerUserAccess](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/PowerUserAccess.html) to learn more about the same.

## Key Concepts
- **Amazon EC2 Instance**: An Amazon EC2 instance is a virtual server in the AWS cloud environment. You'll need an EC2 instance to setup the VM runner and install Harness Delegate. Follow the steps in the given documentation to create an EC2 instance with specific configuration as mentioned. This EC2 instance uses a private VPC and subnet and doesn't allow any public IPs to ensure data is always secure and private with no route to the internet gateway. Read more about [Amazon EC2 Instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Instances.html). 

- **Security Group**: A Security Group acts as a virtual firewall for your EC2 instances to control inbound and outbound traffic. Inbound rules control the incoming traffic to your instance, and outbound rules control the outgoing traffic from your instance. Read more about [Amazon EC2 Security Groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-security-groups.html).  

- **Target Group**: A Target Group is a set of resources (in this case EC2 instances) registered as Targets. This is used to define the targets that a Load Balancer will send traffic to. In this case, we'll be using a **Network Load Balancer** to send traffic to the EC2 instance. Thus we will register the EC2 instance created in this target group and will define the specific protocol and port for the target. Read more about [Amazon EC2 Target Groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/load-balancer-target-groups.html).

- **Listener**: A Listener is configured on the Load Balancer, it is used to listen for the incoming connections on the defined port/protocol. When you create a listener, you specify a target group for its default action. Traffic is forwarded to the target group specified in the listener rule. Read more about [Amazon EC2 Listeners](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/load-balancer-listeners.html).

## Setting up Runner & Installing Delegate

### 1. Create an AWS EC2 Instance
To host the VM Runner and Harness Delegate, an EC2 instance is required. Follow the steps mentioned here to learn more on how to [launch an AWS EC2 Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html#ec2-launch-instance). 

You'll need to configure the **Network configuration** to the following configuration: 
    - **Key Pair**: Under Key pair (login), for Key pair name, choose an **existing key pair** or choose **Create new key** pair to create your first key pair.
    - **VPC**: Select the VPC network for your EC2 instance. You'll be able to find a VPC with your infrastructure name given while provisioning the AWS cloud infrastructure via Harness UI. For example, if the infrastructure name is ``aws-infra-1`` you'll be able to find a VPC with the name ``aws-infra-1-network``. 
    - **Subnet**: From the given options, select the ``private-subnet`` to ensure the network interface is located in a **private subnet**.
    - **Auto-assign Public IP**: ``Disable`` this field to ensure that no public IP is automatically assigned to the primary network interface of the instance. 
    - **Firewall (Security Group)**: Select the ``gateway-sg`` security group to ensure only specific traffic is allowed to reach the instance. You'll be able to find one with the same infrastructure name given while provisioning the AWS cloud infrastructure via Harness UI. For example, if the infrastructure name is ``aws-infra-1`` you'll be able to find a security group with the name ``aws-infra-1-gateway-sg``. 
    - **IAM Instance Profile**: This profile is required for the instance. You'll be able to find a profile with your infrastructure name details given while provisioning the AWS cloud infrastructure via Harness UI. For example, if the infrastructure name is ``aws-infra-1`` you'll be able to find a profile with the name ``aws-infra-1-provisioner-instance-profile``. 

Launch an AWS EC2 instance with the above network configuration, you can choose and customise the other details required accordingly. 

### 2. Create an AWS Target Group
You'll have to create a Target Group for the Load Balancer. This target group will have **EC2 Instances** as the target type. Follow the steps mentioned here to learn more on how to [create a new Target Group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/create-target-group.html). Use the following configuration to create one: 
    - **Target Type**: Select ``Instances`` for the target type. 
    - **Protocol**: This is the protocol required for load balancer-to-target communication. Enter ``TCP`` here to allow the load balancer to communicate with the target instance. 
    - **Port**: This is the port number where targets receive traffic. Enter ``22`` to allow SSH traffic. 
    - **VPC**: This is the field where VPC with the instances to be included in the target group is required. Select the VPC configured earlier during EC2 instance creation. 
    - **Add Targets**: If the target type is Instances, select one or more instances, enter one or more ports, and then choose **Include as pending** below.

Create a Target Group with the above configuration and save the details.  

### 3. Add a Listener in Load Balancer 
You'll have to add a Listener in the Load Balancer to allow traffic to reach the target group. Follow the steps mentioned here to learn more on how to [add a listener](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/create-listener.html). Use the following configuration to add one: 
    - **Load Balancer**: From the Load Balancers screen, select the **NLB** load balancer. 
    - **Listener Protocol & Port**: A listener checks for connection requests using the protocol and port that you configure here. Select ``TCP`` as the protocol and enter any port number as the port. 
    - **Default Action**: Traffic received by a Network Load Balancer listener is forwarded to the selected target group. Select the target group you created in the previous step. 

Create a Listener with the above configuration and save the details. 

### 4. Update Security Group Rules
You'll have to update the ``gateway-sg`` security group rules (the one selected earlier while creating an EC2 instance) to allow traffic to reach the Load Balancer. Follow the steps mentioned here to learn more on how to [update the security group rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/changing-security-group.html#add-remove-security-group-rules). Use the following configuration to update one: 
    - **Inbound Rules**: Add a new rule to allow traffic on the port used by the Load Balancer. 
    - **Type**: Select **Custom TCP** in the Inbound Rule Type. 
    - **Port Range**: Enter the port number used for creating the Listener on the Load Balancer. 

Save the inbound rules for the security group. 

### 5. SSH into the AWS EC2 Instance
Now that your Instance is up and running, all you have to do is connect to your instance using a SSH client. Refer to the documentation to [connect to your instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/connect-linux-inst-ssh.html). To use a ssh client, you need to use the following ``ssh`` command to connect to your instance: 
```
ssh -i <PATH TO YOUR PRIVATE KEY> ec2-user@<REGION_SUBDOMAIN> -p <LISTENER_PORT_NUMBER>
```

### 6. Install Docker 
You'll need **Docker** installed in your AWS VM instance to configure self hosted Gitspaces. Refer to this [installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) on how to install Docker in your VM instance. 

### 7. Start the VM Runner 
Now that you're into the VM instance and you've installed Docker, follow the given steps to start the **Runner**: 
1. Create a ``/runner`` directory on your VM instance and ``cd`` into it:

```
mkdir -p /runner

cd /runner
```

2. In the ``/runner`` directory, create a new file called ``pool.yaml`` in your instance and copy the [same YAML file content](/docs/cloud-development-environments/self-hosted-gitspaces/steps/gitspace-infra-terraform.md#download-the-pool-yaml-file) as you had when you configured the Terraform Module. Refer to [Setup Terraform Module](/docs/cloud-development-environments/self-hosted-gitspaces/steps/gitspace-infra-terraform.md#download-the-pool-yaml-file) to learn more about the same. 
3. Run the following command to **create a new network**: 
```
docker network create harness
```
4. Run the following command to **start a Runner in your VM instance**, make sure you have changed the ``pool.yaml`` file name as the same name you have saved the file with: 
```
docker run -d \
  --network harness \
  --hostname vm-runner \
  -v /runner:/runner \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  --platform linux/amd64 \
  drone/drone-runner-aws:latest \
  delegate \
  --pool /runner/<POOL.YAML FILE>

```
This **starts a VM Runner** in your VM which will **interact with the Harness Delegate** to complete all the various tasks involved in connecting the Harness Control Plane to your self hosted Infrastructure. 

### 8. Install the Delegate 
Now that you have the VM Runner setup and started, you can continue and install **Harness Docker Delegate** in your VM instance to be able to establish a **seamless connection between the Harness Control Plane and your GCP infrastructure**. To learn more about delegates and delegate installation, go to [Delegate installation overview](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/delegates/install-delegates/overview). Please refer to the detailed steps below to install the Delegate: 
:::info
Please ensure you are installing the **Docker Delegate** in your VM instance. For now, Self Hosted Gitspaces will only work with Delegates created at the **Account level**. 
:::

1. In Harness, go to **Account Settings**, select **Account Resources**, and then select **Delegates**.

2. Select **New Delegate** or **Install Delegate**.

3. Select **Docker**.

4. Enter a **Delegate Name**.

5. Copy the **Delegate install command** and run it in your GCP VM. 
  - You can customise the **``cpus``** and **``memory``** fields and increase the spec based on the expected load. 
  - Make sure the **``ACCOUNT_ID``** and **``DELEGATE_TOKEN``** are filled in the given command. These are **mandatory parameter**s. 
  - Add the **``RUNNER URL``** by adding this snippet into your delegate install command: ``-e RUNNER_URL="http://vm-runner:3000/" \`` to ensure the delegate has the runner url. 
  
  Your final install command will look something like this: 

```
docker run -d \
  --network harness \
  --cpus=1 \
  --memory=2g \
  -e DELEGATE_NAME=docker-delegate \
  -e DEPLOY_MODE=KUBERNETES_ONPREM \
  -e NEXT_GEN="true" \
  -e DELEGATE_TYPE="DOCKER" \
  -e ACCOUNT_ID=<ACCOUNT_ID_COPIED_FROM_THE_UI_COMMAND> \
  -e DELEGATE_TOKEN=<DELEGATE_TOKEN_COPIED_FROM_THE_UI_COMMAND>= \
  -e DELEGATE_TAGS=<TAGS TO BE ADDED> \
  -e RUNNER_URL="http://vm-runner:3000/" \
  -e MANAGER_HOST_AND_PORT=https://app.harness.io \
  us-west1-docker.pkg.dev/gar-setup/docker/delegate:25.03.85504
```

Once your Delegate is up and running, you have successfully setup the infrastructure and established a successful connection between the Harness Control Plane and your infrastructure. 

### 9. Update the Delegate Selector
Once youâ€™ve installed and set up your Delegate, enter the specific **Delegate Name** in the **Delegate Selector** field within your Gitspace Infrastructure UI. You can either add it while configuring the Gitspace Infra UI or once you've setup everything, you can edit the infrastructure and add a specific Delegate. Read more about how to use [Delegate Selector](/docs/cloud-development-environments/self-hosted-gitspaces/steps/manage-self-hosted.md#select-delegate-from-delegate-selector). 

You can also select Delegates in the Delegate Selector field using **Delegate Tags**. Read more about [Delegate Tags](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/delegates/manage-delegates/select-delegates-with-selectors#delegate-tags).
