This is your **first step** in configuring **Self Hosted Gitspaces** on **AWS Cloud Infrastructure**. 

In order to get started with Self Hosted Gitspaces, you'll first need to **configure your infrastructure**. This infrastructure is where your Gitspaces will be hosted, so you must **define and configure it from Harness UI**. This guide will take you through the detailed steps to configure your AWS infrastructure using the Harness UI.

---

## Prerequisites

1. Enable the feature flag ``CDE_HYBRID_ENABLED`` in your Harness account since Self Hosted Gitspaces are currently available behind this feature flag. Contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io) to enable this feature flag.
2. Read [Selt Hosted Gitspaces Overview & Key Concepts](/docs/cloud-development-environments/self-hosted-gitspaces/fundamentals.md) to gain a deeper understanding of the basic concepts and setup steps.
3. Only users with **Account-level access** can configure Gitspace infrastructure for now. Go to [Permissions Hierarchy](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/role-based-access-control/rbac-in-harness#permissions-hierarchy-scopes) for more details.
4. Only users with **powerUserAccess** permissions as an AWS user can configure self hosted Gitspaces in your AWS infrastructure. Go to [PowerUserAccess](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/PowerUserAccess.html) to learn more about the same.

## Configure AWS Cloud Infrastructure

Configuring your Gitspace Infrastructure involves adding your infrastructure details in the Harness UI using the steps below. This process generates an **Infra Config YAML** â€” a YAML file that captures your entire infrastructure configuration. This YAML is a required input when running the Harness Gitspace Terraform Module to provision the necessary AWS infrastructure.

### Access Gitspace Infrastructure

1. Only users with the **Account-level access** can configure Gitspace Infrastructure.
2. Navigate to the **Cloud Development Environments** module and open your **Account Settings**.
3. In the side navbar under Account Settings, select **Gitspace Infrastructure**.

### Provide Basic Infrastructure Details

1. **Infrastructure Name**: Provide a **name** for your **Gitspace infrastructure**. This name will be used while referencing your infrastructure for creating Gitspaces.
2. **VPC CIDR Block**: Enter your **VPC CIDR Block** to specify the IP range for the VPC.
3. **Domain**: Provide the **domain** under which all Gitspaces created in this infrastructure will be accessible.
4. **CDE Gateway Instance Type**: Specify the **instance type** for your CDE Gateway.

### Configure Regions
Add and configure regions for Gitspaces. 

:::info gitspace regions
You can only be able to host Gitspaces in these defined regions. 
:::

Click on **New Region** to add a new region. 
For **AWS Cloud Infrastructure** for your Self Hosted Gitspaces, ensure that you have the following: 
1. At least **two availability zones** for each region in your infrastructure. 
2. For every availability zone, provide the **private subnet CIDR block** and **public subnet CIDR block**. 

![](../../static/aws-ui-regions-1.png)

:::info Custom Gateway AMI ID
For a custom gateway AMI ID, only `ubuntu` image variants are currently supported.  
:::

Use the following **input parameters**:
1. **AWS Region**: Select the **AWS region**. Refer to the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-infrastructure/latest/regions/aws-regions.html) to view available regions.
2. **Gateway AMI ID**: Specify the **AMI ID** for your Gateway (AWS Machine Image). **AMI ID** is configured for every region in AWS infrastructure.  
3. **Subdomain**: Provide the **subdomain** for the region. 
4. **Zones**: It's mandatory to add at least **two availability zones** for each region in your infrastructure. Select the availability zones from this field. You can add more than two availability zones if needed using the **"New Zone"** button. 
5. **IP Details**: Provide the **IP configuration** for each availability zone per region. 
   - **Private Subnet CIDR Block**: This is the private IP range required for the subnet. Ensure this IP range is within the VPC CIDR block. 
   - **Public Subnet CIDR Block**: This is the corresponding public IP range required for the subnet. Ensure this IP range is within the VPC CIDR block.

### Configure VM for Runner & Delegate
You'll have to configure the **VM for Runner & Delegate** to ensure that the AWS VM instance required for hosting the VM Runner and Delegate is provisioned as per these details. 

:::info Custom AMI ID
For a custom AMI ID, only `ubuntu` image variants are currently supported.  
:::

Use the following **input parameters**: 
1. **Region**: Choose the **region** from the list of regions added for your infrastructure to host your VM instance. 
2. **Availability Zone**: Choose the **availability zone** from the region selected above for your VM instance. 
3. **AMI ID**: Specify the **AMI ID** for your VM instance.

### Download the Infrastructure Config YAML

Once all details have been entered, click on **Download and Apply YAML**. This will generate the **Infra Config YAML**, which contains the entire Gitspace Infra configuration. This YAML is a mandatory input for [configuring and setting up the Harness Gitspaces Terraform Module](/docs/cloud-development-environments/self-hosted-gitspaces/steps/gitspace-infra-terraform.md), which provisions the AWS infrastructure in your selected account.

![](../../static/aws-hybrid-download-yaml.png)

This is what a **sample Infrastructure Config YAML** looks like: 
```YAML
account_identifier: <ACCOUNT_IDENTIFIER>
infra_provider_config_identifier: <INFRA_PROVIDER_CONFIG_IDENTIFIER>
name: <INFRA_NAME>
domain: <DOMAIN>
vpc_cidr_block: <VPC_CIDR_BLOCK>
gateway:
    instance_type: <INSTANCE_TYPE>
    instances: 1
    version: 1.16.0
    shared_secret: <SHARED_SECRET>
    cde_manager_url: https://app.harness.io/gateway/cde
region_configs:
    <REGION_NAME>:
        region_name: <REGION_NAME>
        availability_zones:
            - zone: <AVAILABILITY_ZONE_1>
              public_cidr_block: <PUBLIC_CIDR_BLOCK_1>
              private_cidr_block: <PRIVATE_CIDR_BLOCK_1>
            - zone: <AVAILABILITY_ZONE_2>
              public_cidr_block: <PUBLIC_CIDR_BLOCK_2>
              private_cidr_block: <PRIVATE_CIDR_BLOCK_2>
        domain: <DOMAIN>
        gateway_ami_id: <GATEWAY_AMI_ID>
```
