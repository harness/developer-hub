## Get Started with Self-Hosted Gitspaces

This is a quick guide to help you set up and launch your Self-Hosted Gitspaces. Follow the steps below:

### 1. Go Through the Architecture & Key Concepts

Before you begin setup, itâ€™s important to understand the **underlying architecture** and **concepts of Self-Hosted Gitspaces**. 

ðŸ”— Make sure to review the following **documentation** thoroughly:

- [Self-Hosted Gitspaces Architecture](/docs/cloud-development-environments/deep-dive-into-gitspaces/self-hosted-architecture.md)  
- [Overview & Key Concepts](/docs/cloud-development-environments/self-hosted-gitspaces/fundamentals.md)   

### 2. Configure Gitspace Infrastructure via Harness UI

Start by configuring your **Gitspace infrastructure via the Harness UI**. This allows you to input your infrastructure details like Project ID, regions, etc., which will be referenced later during provisioning.

ðŸ”— [Configure Gitspace Infrastructure via Harness UI](/docs/cloud-development-environments/self-hosted-gitspaces/steps/gitspace-infra-ui.md)

### 3. Configure and Set Up the Terraform Module

Once the infrastructure is configured in the UI, proceed to initialize and use the **Harness Gitspaces Terraform Module**. This module will **create all required infrastructure** and will set up VM instances for the CDE Gateway. 

ðŸ”— [Set Up Terraform Module](/docs/cloud-development-environments/self-hosted-gitspaces/steps/gitspace-infra-terraform.md)

### 4. Set Up Runner and Install Delegate

After provisioning, install the **Runner and Delegate** on your VM Instance. This ensures the Harness Control Plane can communicate with your infrastructure to create and manage Gitspaces.

ðŸ”— [Set Up Runner and Install Delegate](/docs/cloud-development-environments/self-hosted-gitspaces/steps/runner-delegate.md)

### 5. Create Machines & Gitspaces

Once the setup is complete, you can begin by **creating machines** and **Gitspaces** directly. 

ðŸ”— [Create and Manage Machines](/docs/cloud-development-environments/self-hosted-gitspaces/steps/manage-self-hosted.md)
