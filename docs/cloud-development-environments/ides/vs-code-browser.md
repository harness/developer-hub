Harness CDE provides seamless support to connect and access your Gitspaces remotely within your browser via VS Code. 

This guide will take you through the steps required to access a Gitspace in your VS Code Browser:

1. Start by creating a new Gitspace from the Harness UI. (check the quickstart guide for more details) 
Please ensure that while creating one, you choose “VS Code Browser” as the selected IDE.
