With **IntelliJ IDEA** support, Harness CDE enables seamless and efficient remote development in your Gitspaces with your IDE. This integration leverages **[JetBrains Gateway](https://www.jetbrains.com/remote-development/gateway/)** to establish a direct remote connection with IntelliJ IDEA, eliminating the need for any prior setup.

This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough to help you use IntelliJ IDEA with your Gitspaces. Letâ€™s get started!

## Pre-Requisites
### Install JetBrains Gateway

Before starting out, ensure that [JetBrains Gateway](https://www.jetbrains.com/remote-development/gateway/) is installed on your device. 

JetBrains Gateway is a lightweight desktop application that enables you to work remotely with JetBrains IDEs (IntelliJ Idea) without downloading the full IDE. It connects to a remote server, downloads necessary backend components, and opens your project in a JetBrains client.

### Recommended Gitspace Configuration
:::info
The following Gitspace requirements are optional but highly recommended for the best and most efficient experience when using Gitspaces in **IntelliJ IDEA**. You can refer to the [IntelliJ guide](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/prerequisites.html) here for detailed information on system requirements for remote development.  
:::

#### Recommended Requirements
To ensure optimal performance while connecting to your Gitspace in IntelliJ IDEA, your Gitspace should meet the following specifications:
- **Processor**: Minimum of **4 cores** (vCPUs) with either x86_64 or arm64 architecture.
- **Memory**: At least **8 GB** RAM.
- **Storage**: At least **10 GB** of available disk space.

:::warning
If your Gitspace does not meet the recommended requirements, the following warning may appear during your IntelliJ setup. You can choose to create a new Gitspace that adheres to the recommended specifications or proceed with your existing configuration.

#### Configuring your Gitspace
To meet the recommended specifications, select the **"Large"** machine type while configuring your Gitspace in the Harness UI. This option provides:  
- **Processor**: 4 cores (CPUs)  
- **Memory**: 32 GB RAM
- **Storage**: 30 GB Disk Size
