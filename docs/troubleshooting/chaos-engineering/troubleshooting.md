This section walks you through some common pain points and their workarounds.

## Memory stress fault stressng flag usage

When a memory stress fault (such as [node memory hog](../../chaos-engineering/technical-reference/chaos-faults/kubernetes/node/node-memory-hog) or [pod memory hog](../../chaos-engineering/technical-reference/chaos-faults/kubernetes/pod/pod-memory-hog)) is executed, the fault utilizes all of the available resources in the target system, thereby simulating out of memory scenario. 
You can use another fault parameter, `stressNGFlags` to provide flexibility in the parameters passed to the VM.

### Workaround

The `stressNGFlags` can be used in the following manner. 

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/stressng-flag.yaml yaml)

```yaml
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: LinuxChaosExperiment
metadata:
  name: linux-memory-stress-dev
  labels:
    experimentID: "f7e4a412-74ef-4a0a-9b94-d894afb24be9"
    experimentRunID: "9caeb3ca-b6f3-4e82-b96b-97d57428ef59"
    context: linux-memory-stress
    name: linux-memory-stress-dev
spec:
  experimentId: "f7e4a412-74ef-4a0a-9b94-d894afb24be9"
  experimentRunId: "9caeb3ca-b6f3-4e82-b96b-97d57428ef59"
  cleanupPolicy: retain
  steps:
  - - name: task-1
  tasks:
  - name: task-1
    taskType: "chaos"
    weight: 10
    chaosInfra: "b8d4e0e6-e883-48ad-8b6c-1886bf6edc21"
    definition:
      chaos:
        experiment: linux-memory-stress
        stressChaos/inputs:
          duration: 30s
          workers: 1
          memory: 5m
          stressNGFlags: "--vm-populate"
```

:::tip
The `--vm-populate` in the above manifest is an example to demonstrate how the `stressNGFlags` flag attribute can be utilized. The actual flags placed are entirely your choice (as long as you can validate the said flag in the original stress-ng cmd).

## Cleanup chaos pods in a namespace

When you execute chaos experiments, multiple pods are created with respect to these experiments. If you wish to cleanup the chaos pods in your namespace, execute the commands below:

### Workaround

* List all the pods in your namespace:

```
kubectl get pod -n <namespace_name>
```

* To delete specific pods in your namespace:

```
kubectl delete pod <pod_name> -n <namespace_name>
```

* To delete all evicted pods in your namespace:

```
kubectl delete pods --namespace=<namespace_name> --field-selector=status.phase=Failed
```

## Chaos infrastructure is inactive, how to activate it?

A chaos infrastructure could be inactive due to a variety of reasons. When you try to execute a previously created experiment but the chaos infrastructure is inactive, you can activate it by following the below steps.

![inactive infra](./static/images/inactive-infra.png)

### Workaround

* Navigate to **Overview** tab. Select an infrastructure from the dropdown menu. Click **Next**.

![navigate](./static/images/activate.png)

* Click **Save** to save your changes, and click **Run** to execute the chaos experiment.

## Unable to connect to Kubernetes infrastructure server

Most times, chaos infrastructure errors are a result of issues with chaos infrsstructure setup. 

### Workaround 
If you are unable to connect to the Kubernetes infrastructure server, try the following:

* Use **ping** on the subscriber or any other pod to test if the response times for app.harness.io or another URL are reasonable and consistent.
* Use traceroute on app.harness.io to check the network route.
* Use **nslookup** to confirm that the DNS resolution is working for app.harness.io.
* Connect using the IP address for app.harness.io (you can get the IP address using `nslookup`). For example, http://35.23.123.321/#/login.
* Check for local network issues, such as proxy errors or NAT license limits.
* For some cloud platforms, like AWS EC2, ensure that the security groups allow outbound traffic on HTTPS 443.


## Cluster in GCP has unschedulable pods

GCP may throw an error stating that a cluster has unschedulable pods. This may occur if you don't have sufficient space in your Kubernetes cluster. 

![](../static/troubleshooting-nextgen-00.png)

### Workaround
Depending on the size of the cluster you are using, without [autoscaling](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/scaling-apps#autoscaling_deployments) enabled or enough space, your cluster can't run the delegate (remote component that helps access your k8s cluster and inject faults.
To fix this issue, perform the following steps:
1. Add more space or turn on autoscaling
2. Wait for the cluster to restart
3. Reconnect to the cluster
4. Now rerun the following command:

```
$ kubectl apply -f harness-chaos-enable.yml
```

## Run multiple cluster-scoped chaos infrastructures on same clusters

If the deployment entities are added to and removed from the same cluster, you might have two cluster-scoped chaos infrastructures running on the same cluster.

### Workaround
**Don't** run multiple cluster-scoped chaos infrastructures on the same cluster. This results in the chaos infrastructures overwriting each other's cluster-level resources.

## Environment variable and secret usage references in source mode of command probe

You can use secrets and environment variables in the [**source mode**](../../chaos-engineering/technical-reference/probes/cmd-probe#source-mode) of the command probe using the manifest in the following manner:

```yaml
source:
  env:
  - name: KEY
    value: value
  volumes:
  - name: vol1
    secrets:
    - name: cm1
  volumeMounts:
  - name: vol1
    mountPath: path
 ```
