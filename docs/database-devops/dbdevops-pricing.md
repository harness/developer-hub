Harness Database DevOps provides flexible subscription plans designed to scale with your database deployment needs. Harness offers two primary licensing tiers: **Free Tier** and **Enterprise**.

:::info
- **If You Require More Than 4 Database Instances or 2 Users**: You must upgrade to an Enterprise plan.  
- **Enterprise Plans** scale based on the number of **Database Instances** (preferred metric), providing clear, predictable pricing that grows with your usage.  
:::

## Free Tier

The Free plan is ideal for small teams experimenting with Harness Database DevOps. It provides limited access to core features and allows you to validate the platform before scaling.

| Feature | Free Tier |
|---------|------------|
| **Database Instances** | Up to 4 |
| **Users** | Up to 2 |
| **Free Trial** | Matches free trial duration of other Harness products |

:::note
The Free Tier will only be available when the **Self-Managed Platform Free and Team GA stage** is released.

## Enterprise Plans

Harness Database DevOps Enterprise offers flexibility with two pricing options. Both are billed annually and come with **no minimum commitment**.
