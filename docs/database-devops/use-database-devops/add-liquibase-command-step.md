When you create a pipeline in Harness Database DevOps, the Liquibase command step can help play a role in managing database changes. This step allows users to apply schema modifications and execute SQL scripts seamlessly within the pipeline.

# Add the Liquibase command step 

Here's how you can add the Liquibase command step to your pipeline:

 1. In Harness, go to the **Database DevOps** module and select your **Project**. 
 2. Ensure that the database schema you want to deploy is already set up. You can find the steps about how to create your database schema in the [Deploying Database Schemas documentation](./deploying-database-schema.md).  
 3. Create a new pipeline.
