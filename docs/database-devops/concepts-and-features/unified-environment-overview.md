When you open the Harness Database DevOps module, you will be met with a single pane-of-glass interface that will display an overview of important activities the user may want to know upon using DB DevOps. Here's what you'll be met with:

  - **Left Navigation Menu**: A drop-down menu that will display the multiple options that you can navigate to. 
  - **DB Schemas**: This appears in the top-left under the overview tab. It will show the number of database schemas you have created. 
  - **DB Instances**: This appears directly underneath the **DB Schemas** tab. It shows the number of database instances you have created. 
  - **Most Recent 5 Deployments**: This shows the five most recent deployments that have run. It will display the name of the **schema**, the **instance** it ran on, as well as when it was **last deployed**. 
  - **Last 30 Days Pipeline Executions**: This will show the number of pipeline executions done in the last 30 days from the point of log-in. It will include both failed and successful executions. As the user, you can adjust the type of graph between a bar graph and a line graph. 
  - **Migration State**: This will show the status of recent changesets used. There is also a key on the top right of this setion so you can identify the status displayed in the table.
