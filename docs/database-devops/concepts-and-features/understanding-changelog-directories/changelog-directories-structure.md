# Working with Changelog Directory Structure

This guide explains how to effectively manage changelog file directories. A well-organized changelog file directory structure is crucial for maintaining database changes across multiple instances and environments.

## Using includeAll for Efficient Change Management

The `includeAll` directive is a powerful feature that simplifies the management of changelog files in your directory structure. When specified in your master changelog file, it automatically includes all changelog files from a specified directory in alphabetical order.

### Advantages:
1. **Automatic File Discovery**: No need to manually list each changelog file in your master changelog.
2. **Simplified Maintenance**: Add new changelog files to the directory without modifying the master changelog.
3. **Predictable Ordering**: Files are processed in alphabetical order, making it easy to control execution sequence.
4. **Reduced Human Error**: Eliminates the risk of accidentally omitting changelog files from the master list.

Example usage in a master changelog:

```yaml
databaseChangeLog:
  - includeAll:
      path: db/changelog/releases/
      errorIfMissingOrEmpty: true
      relativeToChangelogFile: true
```

:::tip
Use a consistent naming convention for your changelog files (e.g., `001-feature-name.yaml`, `002-feature-name.yaml`) to ensure they are processed in the intended order when using `includeAll` as the files are processed in **alphabetical order**.

## Directory Structure Approaches

There are several approaches to organizing your changelog files based on your needs and scale. Here are the recommended patterns:

### 1. Organization by Release and Feature

You may want to set up a hierarchical directory structure using a separate directory for each release and a changelog for each feature with changes specific to that release.

For example, the "accounts.yaml" file under the "1-0-0" directory creates a new table, and the "accounts.yaml" file in the "1-0-1" directory alters the same table.

 ``` bash
db/
├── release/
│   ├── 1-0-0/
│   │   ├── accounts.yaml
│   │   └── cart.yaml
│   ├── 1-0-1/
│   │   ├── accounts.yaml
│   │   └── cart.yaml
│   └── 1-1-0/
│       ├── accounts.yaml
│       ├── cart.yaml
│       └── new-feature.yaml
└── changelog-master.yaml           # Main changelog file, includes all changes across releases.
```

Here are the examples for each file in the release-based structure:

**changelog-master.yaml**
```yaml
databaseChangeLog:
  - includeAll:
      path: db/releases/
      errorIfMissingOrEmpty: false
      relativeToChangelogFile: true
```
**release/1-0-0/accounts.yaml**
```yaml
databaseChangeLog:
  - changeSet:
      id: 1
      author: stephen-atwell
      changes:
        - createTable:
            tableName: accounts
            columns:
              - column:
                  name: id
                  type: INT
                  autoIncrement: true
                  constraints:
                    primaryKey: true
              - column:
                  name: name
                  type: VARCHAR(50)
                  constraints:
                    nullable: false
                    unique: true
```

**release/1-0-1/accounts.yaml**
```yaml
databaseChangeLog:
  - changeSet:
      id: 003
      author: stephen-atwell
      changes:
        - createIndex:
            indexName: idx_on_id
            tableName: accounts
            columns:
              - column:
                  name: id
      rollback:
        - dropIndex:
            indexName: idx_on_id
            tableName: accounts
```

**Pros:**
- Clear version history and tracking of changes
- Easy rollback to specific releases
- Better organization for complex applications with multiple features
- Simplifies release planning and deployment
- Makes it easier to maintain release notes

**Cons:**
- Can become complex with many releases
- May have redundant changes across releases
- Harder to get a complete view of a single feature's evolution
- More challenging to manage dependencies between features

### 2. Organization by Entity/Service

This structure groups changes by entity or microservice:

```bash
db/
├── feature/
│   ├── accounts.yaml
│   └── cart.yaml
└── changelog-master.yaml
```

We can refer the above examples to understand the structure of changelogs, only the hierarchy of directories is getting changed here.

**Pros:**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to locate changes for specific entities
- Better for microservices architecture
- Simplified maintenance of individual services
- Easier to manage team ownership of different components

**Cons:**
- Can be challenging to manage cross-entity dependencies
- May complicate release management
- Harder to track chronological order of changes
- Could lead to redundant changes across services

### 3. Single Changelog Approach

A simplified structure with one main changelog (recommended for small projects):

``` yaml
databaseChangeLog:
  - changeSet:
      id: "001"
      author: stephen-atwell
      changes:
        - createTable:
            tableName: users
            columns:
              - column:
                  name: id
                  type: int
                  autoIncrement: true
                  constraints:
                    primaryKey: true
              - column:
                  name: name
                  type: varchar(255)
  
  - changeSet:
      id: "002"
      author: stephen-atwell
      changes:
        - addColumn:
            tableName: users
            columns:
              - column:
                  name: email
                  type: varchar(255)

```

**Pros:**
- Simple to understand and implement
- Easy to track chronological order of changes
- Good for small projects or proof of concepts
- Quick to get started
- Clear linear progression of changes

**Cons:**
- Becomes unwieldy as project grows
- Difficult to manage multiple features or services
- Higher risk of merge conflicts in team settings
- Harder to maintain in the long term
- Challenging to roll back specific changes

## Managing Multiple Instances

There are two primary approaches to managing multiple database instances:

### 1. Branch-Based Approach

Use different branches for different environments:

```
main branch     → Development
qa branch       → QA
prod1 branch    → Production Instance 1
prod2 branch    → Production Instance 2
```

Below attached screen shows the structure of branch-based approach, where we have created `prod` instance for specfic production environment.

![Branch-Based Approach](./static/branch-based.png)

**Pros:**
- Clear separation of environments
- Easy rollback using git history
- Environment-specific configurations

**Cons:**
- Frequent conflicts when multiple developers work on the same changelog file
- Complex resolution process for database schema changes
- Difficulty in managing environment-specific configurations
- Challenging to roll back specific changes

### 2. Directory-Based Approach

Maintain instance-specific directories in the main branch:

``` bash
db/
├── envs/
│   ├── qa/
│   │   ├── master.yaml
│   │   ├── release-1.0.0/
│   │   │   ├── 001-initial-schema.yaml
│   │   │   └── 002-seed-data.yaml
│   │   └── release-1.1.0/
│   │       ├── 001-add-user-preferences.yaml
│   │       └── 002-update-product-tables.yaml
│   ├── prod1/
│   │   ├── master.yaml
│   │   ├── release-1.0.0/
│   │   │   ├── 001-initial-schema.yaml
│   │   │   └── 002-prod1-specific-config.yaml
│   │   └── release-1.1.0/
│   │       └── 001-performance-optimizations.yaml
│   └── prod2/
│       ├── master.yaml
│       └── release-1.0.0/
│           ├── 001-initial-schema.yaml
│           └── 002-prod2-specific-config.yaml
```

Below attached screen shows the structure of directory-based approach, where we are taking the path to specfic directory from **environment variable**.

![Directory-Based Approach](./static/directory-based.png)

**Pros:**
- All configurations in one place
- Easier to manage shared changes
- Better visibility of instance-specific changes

**Cons:**
- Harder to track chronological order of changes
- May have redundant changes across instances
- Challenging to manage dependencies between instances


:::info
Please add a note that, we could use any file format for storing the changelogs. The syntax must be valid, including the correct file extension for the changelog (SQL/YAML/XML/JSON). If the syntax is incorrect, the step will fail, leading to potential issues in the process.
:::


## Recommendations

- For small to medium projects, start with the single changelog approach
- As the project grows, transition to release/feature-based organization
- For multiple instances, choose the branch-based approach if environments are significantly different
- Use directory-based approach when instances share most changes but need instance-specific configurations
