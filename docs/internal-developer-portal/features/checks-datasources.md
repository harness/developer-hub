Harness IDP allows you to integrate various data sources and implement custom checks to ensure your software components adhere to best practices and compliance. In this docs, we'll walk through how to add custom checks and data sources for [scorecards](https://developer.harness.io/docs/internal-developer-portal/features/scorecard) in Harness IDP.

### Overview

Harness IDP allows you to integrate various data sources, such as GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Azure DevOps, and many more, to collect specific data points for each software component. Once a data source is enabled, you can use them to create checks to be used in scorecards.

### Add Custom Checks

1. Under the `Admin` go to `Scorecards`.
2. In the `Scorecards` go to the `Checks` tab and select **Create Custom Check**.
3. Now on the **Create Check** page add a name and description for your check.
4. Under **Rules** you can find the following Data Sources to select from.

:::info

There's a tab called `Data Sources` available in `Scorecards` page to check for supported data sources and the corresponding data points.

The following **Data Points** are available for GitHub Data Source. 

1. **Branch Protection**
- *Objective:* Ensure that branch protection rules disallow force push and delete.
- *Calculation Method:* Fetch `backstage.io/source-location` annotation from the catalog YAML file to find repository details and verify the branch protection rules.
- *Prerequisites:* Github Connector with Admin access. Provide suitable `backstage.io/source-location` annotation if the catalog YAML file is present outside the source GitHub repository.

    ...
spec:
    ...
```

2. **File Existence**
- *Objective:* Verify the existence of a specified file in the repository.
- *Calculation Method:* Use the `backstage.io/source-location` annotation to locate the repository and check for the file’s presence. Make sure to mention the filename with extension or relative path from the root folder (Eg: README.md or docs/README.md) in the conditional input field.
- *Prerequisites:* Provide suitable `backstage.io/source-location` annotation if the catalog YAML file is present outside the source GitHub repository.

**Pre-Requisites**

- For the functioning of Harness Data Source related checks, the Harness CI/CD plugin should be configured with new annotations in catalog info YAML, `harness.io/pipelines` and `harness.io/services` as mentioned in the setup steps instruction of [Harness CI/CD plugin](https://github.com/harness/backstage-plugins/tree/main/plugins/harness-ci-cd#harness-nextgen-cicd-plugin)

:::info

In the Harness Data source, the first pipeline URL from `harness.io/pipelines` is considered for score computation and similarly, the first service URL from `harness.io/services` is considered.

:::

The following **Data Points** are available for Harness Data Source. 

1. **CI Pipeline success rate (last 7 days)**: 
- *Objective:* Used for creating rules that will check the success percent of the ci-pipeline in the past 7 days. (This data point is only applicable for CI Pipelines).
- *Calculation Method:* The success rate is calculated only on CI Pipeline that we provide in catalog info YAML with annotation is considered for evaluating the check.

<docimage path={require('../../internal-developer-portal/features/static/ci-harness.png')}/>

2. **Policy evaluation successful**:
- *Objective:* This data point can be used for creating a rule that will check if the policy evaluation is successful in pipelines. (This data point is applicable to both CI and CD Pipelines)

<docimage path={require('../../internal-developer-portal/features/static/p-harness.png')}/>

3. **Tests passing on CI (boolean)**:
- *Objective:* This data point can be used for creating a rule that will check if all the test cases running the CI Pipeline are passing(not a single failing test case). (This data point is only applicable to CI Pipeline)

<docimage path={require('../../internal-developer-portal/features/static/t-harness.png')}/>

4. **STO stage added in pipeline**:
- *Objective:* This data point can be used for creating a rule that will check if STO stage is added in the pipelines. (This data point is applicable to both CI and CD Pipelines)

<docimage path={require('../../internal-developer-portal/features/static/sto-harness.png')}/>

:::info

**Points to remember**:- 

- In the case of CI Pipeline, the first pipeline that we provide in the annotation in catalog info YAML will be used for evaluating the rules corresponding to data points.
If the rule depends on the execution of the pipeline then the latest execution of the provided CI Pipeline will be considered.

- In the case of CD Pipeline, the latest deployment pipeline using the first service that we provide in the annotation in catalog info YAML is considered for evaluating the rules corresponding to data points.

- If the data point depends on both CI and CD Pipelines, annotations corresponding to both should be present in the catalog YAML

:::

### Error Scenarios:

1. In case the check fails, the failure summary will provide the details for the pipeline because of which the check is failing. [We can refer to the pipeline and fix the pipeline with respect to the corresponding check]

<docimage path={require('../../internal-developer-portal/features/static/es1-harness.png')}/>

2. In case if annotation is missing the catalog info YAML, we will get the failure summary for the check in order to add the annotation [We can refer to the Pre-Requisite section to add it]

<docimage path={require('../../internal-developer-portal/features/static/es2-harness.png')}/>

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Catalog">
```
The following **Data Points** are avilable for Catalog Data Source. 

1. **Owner is defined**:
- *Objective:* Checks if the catalog YAML file has the owner configured or not
- *Calculation Method:* The catalog YAML is inspected to check if the owner is under the spec field and the owner should not be Unknown.

<docimage path={require('../../internal-developer-portal/features/static/owner-catalog.png')}/>

**Example YAML**

```
apiVersion: backstage.io/v1alpha1

```

2. **Documentation Exists**:
- *Objective:* Checks if the catalog YAML file has the annotation `backstage.io/techdocs-ref` configured or not.
- *Calculation Method:* The catalog YAML is inspected to check if the `backstage.io/techdocs-ref` is present under the metadata field.
- *Prerequisites:* The directory configured should have the `mkdocs.yml` file and a docs directory having all the documentation in markdown format.

<docimage path={require('../../internal-developer-portal/features/static/doc-catalog.png')}/>

**Example YAML**

```
apiVersion: backstage.io/v1alpha1

    backstage.io/techdocs-ref: dir:.
    ...
spec:
    ...

```

3. **Pagerduty is set**:

- *Objective:* Checks if the catalog YAML file has the annotation `pagerduty.com/service-id` configured or not.
- *Calculation Method:* The catalog YAML is inspected to check if the `pagerduty.com/service-id` is present under the metadata field.
- *Prerequisites:* The Pagerduty plugin needs to be configured and enabled in the admin section. Please [refer](https://developer.harness.io/docs/internal-developer-portal/plugins/available-plugins/pagerduty/) here for more details. 

<docimage path={require('../../internal-developer-portal/features/static/pager-catalog.png')}/>

```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Kubernetes">
```

### Prerequisites:

1. **Plugin Configuration**

- The Kubernetes plugin needs to be configured. Refer [here](https://developer.harness.io/docs/internal-developer-portal/plugins/available-plugins/kubernetes).

:::info

The plugin provides 2 ways to authenticate - `serviceAccount` and `Google authentication`. But currently, the scorecards supports `serviceAccount` type authentication only.

:::

2. **Entity Configuration**

- There are two ways to surface Kubernetes components as part of an entity using annotations - `backstage.io/kubernetes-id` and `backstage.io/kubernetes-label-selector`. But currently, scorecards support [backstage.io/kubernetes-label-selector](https://backstage.io/docs/features/kubernetes/configuration/#label-selector-query-annotation) annotation only. 

The following **Data Points** are available for Kubernetes Data Source.

1. **Replicas Count**:

- *Objective:* Fetches the number of replicas configured for the given service.
- *Calculation Method:* The label selector configured in the catalog YAML is used to identify the Kubernetes workload and the configured replica count is used. The cluster details configured in the Kubernetes plugin are used. If more than one cluster is configured, the workload search is done in each cluster and a minimum of all the replica counts is taken into consideration.
- *Prerequisites:* The Kubernetes plugin needs to be configured and enabled in the admin section. Refer [here](https://developer.harness.io/docs/internal-developer-portal/plugins/available-plugins/kubernetes) for more details. 

<docimage path={require('../../internal-developer-portal/features/static/replica-k8s.png')}/>

2. **Days passed since the application was last deployed**:

- *Objective:* Fetches the number of days since the most recent deployment was done.
- *Calculation Method:* The label selector configured in the catalog YAML is used to identify the `Kubernetes workload` and the `lastUpdateTime` is used from the conditions section. The cluster details configured in the Kubernetes plugin are used. If more than one cluster is configured, the workload search is done in each cluster and the oldest deployment time of all is taken into consideration.
- *Prerequisites:* The Kubernetes plugin needs to be configured and enabled in the admin section. Refer [here](https://developer.harness.io/docs/internal-developer-portal/plugins/available-plugins/kubernetes) for more details.
