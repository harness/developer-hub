Harness Internal Developer Portal integrates with a number of third-party providers to provide a single pane of glass for developers.

## Plugins for IDP

Harness IDP supports a number of plugins to integrate the software catalog with third-party providers. Please find the growing list of [supported plugins](/docs/category/available-plugins). This is a subset of the [Backstage plugin marketplace](https://backstage.io/plugins).

## Git providers that IDP supports

Any software component can be registered in the catalog by using a YAML file stored in the following Git providers:

* GitHub
* GitLab
* Bitbucket
* Azure Repos

## CI/CD providers that IDP supports

Harness IDP is agnostic to your CI/CD provider and works with tools such as GitLab, CircleCI, and GitHub Actions. You can use Harness CI/CD for a better out-of-the-box experience but it's not required.
