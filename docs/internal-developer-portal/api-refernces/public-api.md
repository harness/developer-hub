## Catalog Entities API

### Endpoint

Retrieves catalog entities that match a specific filter from the Harness IDP.

### HTTP Method

`GET`

### URL 

```bash
https://idp.harness.io/{ACCOUNT_IDENTIFIER}/idp/api/catalog/entities
```
### URL Parameters

1. `ACCOUNT_IDENTIFIER`: Your Harness account ID.

You can find your account ID in any Harness URL, for example:

```bash
https://app.harness.io/ng/account/ACCOUNT_ID/idp/overview
```

2. Lists entities. Supports the following **query parameters**, described in sections below:

`filter`, for selecting only a subset of all entities
`fields`, for selecting only parts of the full data structure of each entity
`offset`, `limit`, and `after` for pagination

#### Filtering
You can pass in one or more filter sets that get matched against each entity. Each filter set is a number of conditions that all have to match for the condition to be true (conditions effectively have an AND between them). At least one filter set has to be true for the entity to be part of the result set (filter sets effectively have an OR between them).

Example:

```bash
/entities?filter=kind=user,metadata.namespace=default&filter=kind=group,spec.type

  Return entities that match

    Filter set 1:
      Condition 1: kind = user
                   AND
      Condition 2: metadata.namespace = default

    OR

    Filter set 2:
      Condition 1: kind = group
                   AND
      Condition 2: spec.type exists
```

### Headers
- `x-api-key`: Your Harness API token.
- `Harness-Account`: Your Harness account ID.

### cURL Example

```cURL
curl 'https://idp.harness.io/{ACCOUNT_IDENTIFIER}/idp/api/catalog/entities?filter=kind=template' \
--header 'x-api-key: {X_API_KEY}' \
--header 'Harness-Account: {ACCOUNT_IDENTIFIER}'
```

### Response:
The response will include a list of catalog entities that match the specified filter criteria.
