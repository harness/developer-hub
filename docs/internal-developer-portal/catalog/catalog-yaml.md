## What's new in IDP 2.0?
IDP 2.0 implements a Harness-native entity schema featuring targeted adjustments to previous Backstage-style YAML configurations. These changes primarily introduce scope concepts (project, organization, or account) while enhancing readability based on user feedback.

JSON Schemas for all Catalog entities are available through our API.

#### Migrating to 2.0

To simplify migration, we‚Äôve developed an API that converts **Backstage Catalog YAML** to the **Harness Catalog YAML** format. This conversion is also available directly in the **user interface**‚Äîsimply paste your Backstage Catalog YAML to automatically generate the corresponding Harness format.  
You can [read more about converting your legacy Backstage YAMLs here](#).

All existing Catalog entities and Workflows will be **automatically migrated** to IDP 2.0. Additionally, a new Git Experience tool will be available to help you **commit these converted definitions directly to their respective YAML files in Git**.

#### ‚®Å New fields

- `orgIdentifier` (optional)
- `projectIdentifier` (optional)

These fields define the entity's scope. For project-scoped entities, both fields will be present. For organization-scoped entities, only `orgIdentifier` will appear. Account-level entities will have the scope automatically assigned to the account.

#### ‚ôªÔ∏è Updated fields

- `metadata.name` becomes `identifier`
  - This aligns with Harness Entity YAML definitions and enhances UX consistency. Moved to root level due to its importance to entity definition.
- `metadata.title` becomes `name`
  - Aligned with Harness Entity YAML definitions and moved to root level to reflect its critical importance.
- `spec.type` becomes `type`
  - Relocated to root level as it is fundamental to entity definition. The `kind` and `type` fields define entity behavior and should appear together.
- `spec.owner` becomes `owner`
  - Moved to root level to emphasize its significance. IDP Catalog addresses ownership challenges, warranting prominent placement of this field.

#### ‚äñ Removed fields

- `metadata.namespace`
  - Previously used in Backstage for scoping (typically set as default). With the introduction of Harness Platform Hierarchy, `namespace` becomes redundant. Scope is now determined using `projectIdentifier` and `orgIdentifier`.
- `spec.system` and `spec.domain`
  - These fields previously helped organize components within systems. Since entities will now exist within Harness projects and organizations, these structures will replace System and Domain functionality.

#### Unchanged fields

- `metadata` continues to be flexible. You can define your own properties within metadata.
- `annotations`, `description`, `tags`, `links`, `labels` etc. continue to be part of metadata.

## Common to All Kinds: The Envelope

The root object of your Catalog YAML file follows a standard structure. Below are the core properties that can be included in your Catalog YAML, as defined in **IDP 2.0**:

---

### `apiVersion`

The `apiVersion` field specifies the version of the specification format that the entity conforms to. It plays a critical role in ensuring compatibility and evolution of the entity schema over time. This field is **mandatory** for every entity definition, as it allows the parser to correctly interpret the structure and content of the entity.

#### üîÑ What‚Äôs New with IDP 2.0?

With IDP 2.0, we've introduced a Harness-native entity schema. As part of this change, all entities now use an `apiVersion` prefixed with `harness.io/`.

Use the following **default value** for your catalog entities:

```yaml
apiVersion: harness.io/v1
```

---

### `kind`

The `kind` field defines the **high-level** type of entity being described in the YAML file. When combined with `apiVersion`, it helps the parser understand how to interpret the rest of the entity‚Äôs structure and behavior. This field is also **mandatory** for every entity definition.

#### üîÑ Changes to `kind` in IDP 2.0

With **IDP 2.0**, we've introduced several key updates to the `kind` property to align with the new Harness-native schema:

1. **`Template ‚Üí Workflow`**  
   `kind: Template` has been renamed to `kind: Workflow`. During migration, all existing entities using `kind: Template` will be automatically updated to `kind: Workflow`.

2. **Deprecated: `System` ‚Üí Use `Project`**  
   The `kind: System` entity is now deprecated and replaced with `kind: Project`, better reflecting the Harness project-scoping model.

3. **Deprecated: `Domain` ‚Üí Use `Org`**  
   The `kind: Domain` entity has been deprecated and replaced with `kind: Org`, aligning with the organizational hierarchy in Harness.

4. **Deprecated: `Location`**  
   The `kind: Location` entity is no longer supported. Previously used in IDP 1.0 to reference YAML paths, it often caused conflicts during refresh operations. With all entities now natively managed in Harness, this is obsolete.

---

### `identifier`

The `identifier` field is a **unique, machine-readable** reference for the entity. It serves as the primary key for identifying and interacting with the entity.

| **Property**            | **Description**                                                                                       |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Reference in IDP 1.0** | `metadata.name` becomes `identifier`: moved to root level and aligned with Harness Entity YAML.      |
| **Uniqueness**         | Must be **unique** per `kind` (case-sensitive).                                                      |
| **Required**           | ‚úÖ Yes, this field is **mandatory** for all entities.                                                 |

This field can be reused after an entity is deleted. It must adhere to the format defined [here](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/references/entity-identifier-reference/#identifier-naming-rules).

All entity references across the platform use the `identifier`.

Example usage:

```yaml
identifier: artist
```

---

### `name`

The `name` field represents the display name of the entity shown in the UI.

| **Property**            | **Description**                                                                                   |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Reference in IDP 1.0** | `metadata.title` becomes `name`: moved to root level for better alignment with Harness YAML.      |
| **Uniqueness**         | Not required to be unique.                                                                        |
| **Required**           | ‚ùå No, this field is **optional**.                                                                |

This field supports explanatory or user-friendly strings and may contain special characters.

Example usage:

```yaml
name: Artist Service
```

---

### `type`

In IDP 2.0, `spec.type` becomes `type` and is relocated to the root level due to its importance. This field represents the type of entity (e.g., website, service, library).

The `kind` and `type` fields together define entity behavior and should always appear together.

While the catalog accepts any string value here, organizations should maintain a consistent taxonomy. Common examples include:

1. `service` - a backend API service  
2. `website` - a frontend web application  
3. `library` - a reusable software component (e.g., npm module, Java library)

Example usage:

```yaml
type: service
```

---

### `projectIdentifier`

In IDP 2.0, `spec.system` becomes `projectIdentifier`. Legacy **System** entities are now mapped to Harness Projects.

This field indicates which Project the entity belongs to. It is **optional** for Org or Account-scope entities, but **required** for those created at the Project scope.

Example usage:

```yaml
projectIdentifier: public-websites
```

---

### `orgIdentifier`

In IDP 2.0, `spec.domain` becomes `orgIdentifier`. Legacy **Domain** entities are now mapped to Harness Orgs.

This field indicates which Org the entity belongs to.

Example usage:

```yaml
orgIdentifier: default
```

---

### `owner`

`spec.owner` is now `owner` and maps to Harness Users or User Groups depending on the scope.

While `owner` is not mandatory, it is **strongly recommended** to associate entities with logical owning teams.

- At **Project scope**: any User/User Group from Project, Org, or Account can be assigned.  
- At **Org scope**: assign Users/User Groups from Org or Account.  
- At **Account scope**: assign from Account-level only.

---

### `metadata`

A container for auxiliary data that is not part of the entity‚Äôs specification. Additional metadata helps enhance platform-level processing or categorization.

---

### `spec`

Defines the actual specification data that describes the entity. This is the core configuration and varies depending on the `kind`. See individual sections for specific structure guidelines.

---

## Kind: Component

### Mandatory Properties 
### Additional Properties 
### Example YAML

## Kind: Workflow

## Kind: Project

## Kind: Org

## Kind: API

## Kind: Resource

## Kind: Group

## Kind: User

## Kind: Location [Deprecated]
The Backstage **Location** entity serves as a reference to a YAML path that outputs other entities. However, since all entities are managed directly within the Harness platform with IDP 2.0, the Location entity is no longer necessary. As a result, it is deprecated.
