## Introduction

With your [catalog populated with software components](/docs/internal-developer-portal/get-started/register-a-new-software-component) and [plugins enabled](/docs/internal-developer-portal/get-started/enable-a-new-plugin), it's time to create a scorecard. Using the [catalog datasource](https://developer.harness.io/docs/internal-developer-portal/scorecards/checks-datasources#catalog), you can monitor the existence of essential root fields and integrations defined through annotations in the catalog-info.yaml metadata. Tracking this information within the catalog helps to enforce organizational engineering standards.

#### Register a Software Component

1. Register a software component following the steps mentioned [here](https://developer.harness.io/docs/internal-developer-portal/catalog/register-software-component), if you already have software components registered in your catalog you can move directly to creating a Scorecard. Here's an example of `catalog-info.yaml` we will be using for this tutorial.

```YAML

## Create a catalog readiness Scorecard

### Pre-requisite

Make sure you have the [IDP Admin](https://developer.harness.io/docs/internal-developer-portal/rbac/resources-roles#1-idp-admin) or [IDP Platform Engineer](https://developer.harness.io/docs/internal-developer-portal/rbac/resources-roles#2-idp-platform-engineer) role assigned to you with permissions to view, create and edit [scorecards](https://developer.harness.io/docs/internal-developer-portal/rbac/resources-roles#1-scorecards)

### Create Scorecard

1. Go to **Scorecards** under **Admin** and **Create a New Scorecard**.

2. Now add the following available checks
    - Spec owner exists
    - Tech Docs exists
    - Pagerduty is setup

3. For **Filter catalog entities for which the scorecard is evaluated** select the kind as **Component** and type **all**

4. Now Publish the **Scorecard**.

5. Go to your catalog and check for your software component you'll find the scores for catalog readiness.

## Create a Custom Check  

Now that the scorecard has been created, letâ€™s update it by adding a Custom Check to track Jira configurations. Custom checks are user-defined checks that can be created in addition to the default checks provided. These are built using the available [data sources](https://developer.harness.io/docs/internal-developer-portal/scorecards/checks-datasources) and data points.

1. Go to **Scorecards** under **Admin**.
2. Select **Create Custom Check** under **Checks**. 

![](./static/scorecards-checks.png)

3. Now we will be creating a custom check to check for Jira annotation.
4. Add the **Name** and **Description**
5. Now under Rules select **All Of** and the Datasource as **Catalog Info YAML**.
6. Select the Datapoint as **Annotation exists**, with annotation value as `jira/project-key` to be mentioned on your `catalog-info.yaml`. 
7. Now add the operator as `Equal to` with value as `True`.
8. Save the changes.

### Update the Scorecard with Custom Check

Let's edit the previously created catalog readiness scorecard to add the custom check we created above along with the already added default checks. 

1. Go to Scorecards and select **Edit**.

2.  Now add the Custom Check **Jira Check** you created above.

3. For **Filter catalog entities for which the scorecard is evaluated** select the kind as **Component** and type **all**

4. Now Publish the **Scorecard**.

5. Go to your catalog and check for your software component you'll find the scores for catalog readinesss.
