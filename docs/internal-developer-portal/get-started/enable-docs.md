By default, the **Docs** tab in your catalog does not include documentation for a new software component. However, you can quickly publish Markdown documentation to the **Docs** tab.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';



<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Docs Available in the Root of Source Folder ">


To add documentation:

1. Create a `docs` directory next to where you have `catalog-info.yaml`.
2. Inside the `docs` directory, create an `index.md` file with the following contents.

```
# Welcome!

This is a basic example of documentation. It is intended to showcase some of the
features that TechDocs provides out of the box.

## Basic Markdown

Headings:

# h1

## h2

### h3

#### h4

##### h5

###### h6

Here is a bulleted list:

- Item one
- Item two
- Item Three

simply create documentation.

## Table example

While this documentation isn't comprehensive, in the future it should cover the following
topics outlined in this example table:

| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Topic 1 | An introductory topic to help you learn about the component. |
| Topic 2 | A more detailed topic that explains more information.        |
| Topic 3 | A final topic that provides conclusions and lessons learned. |
