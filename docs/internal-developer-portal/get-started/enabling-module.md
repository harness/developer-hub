## Prerequisites
Ensure your team is ready for IDP 2.0 onboarding by reviewing the [breaking changes](/docs/internal-developer-portal/idp-2o-overview/2-0-overview-and-upgrade-path.md) list and understanding the key [essentials of upgrading to IDP 2.0](/docs/internal-developer-portal/idp-2o-overview/migrating-idp-2o.md).

  > ⚠️ Rollback is not straightforward, so it's critical to thoroughly understand the scope and impact of these changes.


## Enabling IDP 2.0 

Once you’re confident about upgrading:

* **Submit a Support Ticket**: 
  Raise a ticket with [Harness Support](https://support.harness.io) to enable the `IDP_2_0` feature flag on your account.

* **Join an Upgrade Call (Early Access Customers)**: 
  Our team will schedule a call with you to walk through the upgrade process and enable the feature flag.

* **Enable in a Test Environment First (Recommended)**: 
  If you have a **test or staging environment**, enable IDP 2.0 there first. This allows your team to safely explore the new experience before enabling it in production.

## Enabling IDP 1.0 

Harness IDP is currently available to a limited set of customers. To get started, send an email to idp-interest@harness.io for a demo and a Harness specialist will get you going.

Once Harness IDP is enabled in your account, an account administrator can onboard your services and configure the required plugins.

If the module is enabled, and you are an account administrator, go to [Setting up IDP](./setup-git-integration.md).
