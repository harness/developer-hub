Harness IDP is currently available to a limited set of customers. To get started, send an email to idp-interest@harness.io for a demo and a Harness specialist will get you going.

Once Harness IDP is enabled in your account, an account administrator can onboard your services and configure the required plugins.

If the module is enabled and you are an account administrator, go to [Setting up IDP](./setup-git-integration.md).
