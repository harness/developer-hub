## Introduction

Custom Dashboards are a Harness Platform Feature, that allows you to key metrics and data related to your module. You can customize the dashboards to show specific metrics and data relevant to your needs, and access them from a central location. The Harness Dashboards provide actionable insights out of your IDP, so you can enable good developer experience in your org.
