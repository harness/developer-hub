Self-service workflows in Harness IDP are powered by **Harness Pipelines**. Each workflow’s backend is configured using Actions and Harness Pipelines. Below is a detailed guide to setting this up in Harness IDP.

## Harness Pipelines: Backend Orchestration
Harness Pipeline acts as a robust orchestration engine for self-service workflows in Harness IDP. It is directly connected to executing specific tasks in your workflow via defined actions and pipelines.

### Connecting Inputs, Actions and Harness Pipelines
When a workflow is executed, users provide input details required for pipeline execution. These inputs are passed into the pipeline through a workflow action, which triggers specific steps in the pipeline. These steps can perform tasks such as launching a CI/CD process, registering a service in the catalog, setting up infrastructure, etc. 

The action accepts the **Harness Pipeline URL** as input, along with an authentication token that is automatically inserted into the parameters section. This seamless integration is enabled by Harness IDP being part of the broader Harness SaaS ecosystem. Users can also manage workflows via pipelines’ RBAC.

### IDP Stage
Harness IDP includes a native IDP Stage where all IDP-specific tasks required for pipeline execution are pre-configured as pipeline steps within the stage. This enables quick and efficient creation of self-service workflows. 

The IDP Stage provides built-in support for:
- Git cloning
- Cookiecutter templating
- Repository creation
- Catalog creation and registration
- Slack notifications
- Resource creation using Harness IaCM powered by OpenTofu

Currently, Harness-specific workflow actions support:
- IDP Stage
- Custom Stage (Available with Harness CD License or Free Tier)
- Codebase-disabled CI Stage with Run Step (Available with Harness CI License)

## Creating a Harness Pipeline from Harness IDP
To create a Harness Pipeline using the IDP Stage, follow these steps:
1. In your Harness IDP, go to **Admin -> Select Project**.
2. Now start with **Create a Pipeline**.
![](./static/navigate-pipeline.gif)

3. Add a **Name**, select the type as **Inline** and **Continue**.
![](./static/name-pipeline.png)

4. Now **Select Stage Type** as **Developer Portal** and add a [name for your stage](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/pipelines/add-a-stage/#stage-names) to **Set Up Stage**.
![](./static/dev-portal-stage-selection.png)
![](./static/set-up-stage.png)

### Infrastructure

Under **Infrastructure** tab, Harness recommends [Harness Cloud](https://developer.harness.io/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/set-up-build-infrastructure/use-harness-cloud-build-infrastructure#use-harness-cloud), but you can also use a [Kubernetes cluster](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/set-up-build-infrastructure/k8s-build-infrastructure/set-up-a-kubernetes-cluster-build-infrastructure), [local runner](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/set-up-build-infrastructure/define-a-docker-build-infrastructure) or [self-managed AWS/GCP/Azure VM](/docs/category/set-up-vm-build-infrastructures) build infrastructure.

![](./static/infrastructure.png)

### Pipeline Variables 
Before adding the execution steps, we need to create some pipeline variables with runtime inputs, which will be used as expression inputs in various steps during execution.

To add pipeline variables:

1. Navigate to the right-hand side of your page and click on the **Variables** icon.  
2. Under **Custom Variables**, select **+Add Variable**.  
![](./static/navigate-variable.png)
3. Assign a name to the variable and set the input type to **Runtime**.
![](./static/add-variable.png)

### Passing Inputs
The ```spec.parameters``` field in ```workflow.yaml``` contains the inputs required for the configuration. The keys under ```properties``` represent unique IDs for various input fields. These keys correspond to the pipeline variables that must be set as runtime inputs when configuring the pipeline. These inputs are designed to prompt the developer to provide necessary details when creating a new application.

The ```spec.steps``` field specifies a single action: triggering a Harness pipeline. This action requires mainly three inputs:

- **Pipeline URL**: The endpoint for the pipeline to be triggered.
- **Input Set**: A collection of runtime input variables that the pipeline requires.
- **API Key**: Used to authenticate and authorize the pipeline trigger.

All pipeline variables must be declared in the `inputset` within `workflow.yaml`, with their values aligned to the input parameters specified in the `spec.parameters` properties section.

#### Example ```workflow.yaml```
:::info
The syntax `{{ parameters.x }}` is only supported within the `steps` section when configuring the Workflows Backend. It cannot be used in the `properties` section to reference another parameter.
:::

```YAML
...
spec:
  parameters:
    - title: Service Details
      properties:
        projectId:
            title: Project Identifier
            description: Harness Project Identifier
            type: string
            ui:field: HarnessProjectPicker
        template_type:
          title: Type of the Template
          type: string
          description: Type of the Template
          ui:readonly: $${{ parameters.another_field}}  ## NOT SUPPORTED
  steps:
    - id: trigger
      name: Creating your react app
      action: trigger:harness-custom-pipeline
      input:
        url: "https://app.harness.io/ng/account/account_id/module/idp/orgs/org_id/projects/project_id/pipelines/pipeline_id/pipeline-studio/?storeType=INLINE"
        inputset:
          project_id: ${{ parameters.projectId }}  ## SUPPORTED
          template_type: ${{ parameters.template_type }} ## SUPPORTED
...
```
### Fetching Outputs
You can configure your workflows to fetch output from the **Harness Pipeline** and display pipeline output variables using `workflow.yaml`. Here’s how you can do it:  

1. In your `workflow.yaml`, under the `steps` property field, set `showOutputVariables` to `true`.  
2. Define pipeline output variables under the `output` field in your YAML configuration.  

There are two ways to add output variables in the workflow syntax:  

1. **Directly referencing the output variable name:**  
   ```yaml
   ${{ steps.trigger.output.test2 }}
   ```  
   Here, `test2` is the output variable created in the pipeline.  

2. **Using the JEXL expression from execution logs:**  
   - Copy the JEXL expression of the output variable and remove the JEXL constructs.  
   - Example:  
     ```yaml
     ${{ steps.trigger.output['pipeline.stages.testci.spec.execution.steps.Run_1.output.outputVariables.test1'] }}
     ```  
   - In this case, `pipeline.stages.testci.spec.execution.steps.Run_1.output.outputVariables.test1` is derived from: 
     ```yaml
     <+pipeline.stages.testci.spec.execution.steps.Run_1.output.outputVariables.test2>
     ```  
     ![](./static/output-variables.png)
  
  This approach ensures that pipeline outputs are correctly fetched and displayed. 


#### Example ```workflow.yaml```
```YAML
steps:
  - id: trigger
      name: Creating your react app
      action: trigger:harness-custom-pipeline
      input:
      url: "https://app.harness.io/ng/account/vpCkHKsDSxK9_KYfjCTMKA/home/orgs/default/projects/communityeng/pipelines/IDP_New_NextJS_app/pipeline-studio/?storeType=INLINE"
      inputset:
          project_name: ${{ parameters.project_name }}
          github_repo: ${{ parameters.github_repo }}
          cloud_provider: ${{ parameters.provider }}
          db: ${{ parameters.db }}
          cache: ${{ parameters.cache }}
      apikey: ${{ parameters.token }}
      showOutputVariables: true
output:
  text:
    - title: Output Variable
      content: |
        Output Variable **test2** is `${{ steps.trigger.output.test2 }}`
    - title: Another Output Variable
      content: |
        Output Variable **test1** with fqnPath is `${{ steps.trigger.output['pipeline.stages.testci.spec.execution.steps.Run_1.output.outputVariables.test1'] }}`
```

:::info
Please note that while **user-defined output variables** are allowed for the above use-case, you can also use **system-generated variables** by assigning them as a new variable under the **Shell Script** step, as shown below.  

For example, if a system-generated output variable is **`jira_id`**, you can define it as a **user-defined output variable** under **Optional Configuration** by assigning it to a new variable, such as `test-var`. This newly defined variable (`test-var`) can then be displayed as output in the **IDP workflows**.

![](./static/output-variable.png)
:::


### Execution Steps
You can add various **execution steps** (pre-included with the **IDP stage**) under the **Execution** tab. Refer to the detailed guide below for step-by-step instructions on adding and implementing **IDP stage execution steps**. 

![](./static/execution-pipeline.png)

## IDP Stage 
The self-service flow in IDP is powered by the Harness Pipelines. A stage is a part of a pipeline that contains the logic to perform a major segment of a larger workflow defined in a pipeline. Stages are often based on the different workflow milestones, such as building, approving, and delivering.

The process of adding a stage to a pipeline is the same for all Harness modules. When you add a stage to a pipeline, you select the stage type, such as **Developer Portal** for IDP or **Build** for CI or **Deploy** for CD. The available stage settings are determined by the stage type, and, if applicable, the module associated with the selected stage type.

This functionality is limited to the modules and settings that you have access to.

:::info

#### Limitations

- The "Clone Codebase (Git Clone)" action is not supported at the stage level for the IDP stage.

<DocImage path={require('./static/git-clone-not.png')} width="40%" height="40%" title="Click to view full size image" />

- [Looping strategies](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/pipelines/looping-strategies/looping-strategies-matrix-repeat-and-parallelism) (Parallelism, Matrix, Repeat) are not supported for the IDP stage.

:::

### 1. Git Clone 
*(Ignore this step if your repository containing the cookiecutter template is public)*

Add a Git Clone step to clone a repository into the Developer Portal stage's workspace. By cloning the repository, you gain access to the necessary code, scripts, or configurations, enabling various actions.

The Git Clone step uses a containerized step group. For more information, refer to [Containerize Step Groups](https://developer.harness.io/docs/continuous-delivery/x-platform-cd-features/cd-steps/containerized-steps/containerized-step-groups/).

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Pipeline Studio" label="Pipeline Studio" default>

1. In your Developer Portal stage, under Execution, select Add Step.
2. Select Git Clone.
3. Configure the step using the settings described below. 

**Configuration Settings**

1. **Select Git Provider**: You can choose **Third-party Git Provider** if your code is not hosted in the Harness Code Repository.

2. **Connector**: You can select a connector for the source control provider hosting the code repository that you want to clone.

:::info
- The connection type ``ssh`` is currently not supported for Connectors.
- For credentials, only Username and Password types are supported.
:::

You can refer to the following resources for more information on creating code repo connectors:
- Azure Repos: [Connect to Azure Repos](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/connectors/code-repositories/connect-to-a-azure-repo)
- Bitbucket: [Bitbucket Connector Settings Reference](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/connectors/code-repositories/ref-source-repo-provider/bitbucket-connector-settings-reference)

    - [Connect to an AWS CodeCommit Repo](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/connectors/code-repositories/connect-to-code-repo)

3. **Repository Name**:
- If the connector's URL Type is set to **Repository**, the Repository Name is automatically populated based on the connector's configuration.
- If the connector's URL Type is set to **Account**, you must manually specify the repository name to clone into the stage workspace.

4. **Build Type, Branch Name, and Tag Name**:
For Build Type, choose:
- Git Branch to clone code from a specific branch.
- Git Tag to clone code from a specific commit tag.
Based on your selection, specify the Branch Name or Tag Name.

:::info
You can use fixed values, runtime inputs, or variable expressions for branch and tag names. For instance, you can enter input for the branch or tag name to specify them at runtime.
:::

5. **Clone Directory** (Optional): You can specify the target path in the stage workspace where the repository should be cloned.

6. **Depth**: You should specify the number of commits to fetch when cloning the repository. 
The default depth is 0, which fetches all commits from the specified branch.
For more details, refer to the [Git Clone Documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone).

       type: branch
       spec:
         branch: main
```

### 2. Cookiecutter

Cookiecutter step is used to take inputs for the cookiecutter template. 

:::warning

In the example provided for this step we have used pipeline variables as input for many fields, make sure you have the corresponding pipeline variable created with proper value [as described under pipeline variables](https://developer.harness.io/docs/internal-developer-portal/flows/idp-stage#pipeline-variables). 

:::



<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Pipeline Studio" label="Pipeline Studio" default>

![](./static/cookicutter.png)

#### Repository Type

Select the repository type in which your template is stored, which could be public or private git repository. 

:::info

In case it's **Private** make sure you have added the **gitclone step** and the **path for template** should be the **Clone Directory** added in **gitclone step**

In case of public templates you just need to add the public URL of the template path stored in your git provider. eg `https://github.com/devesh-harness/test-cookicutter`

:::

In case you have your own cookiecutter template, make sure the directory structure in the repository should be as follows

```sh
cookiecutter-something/
├── {{ cookiecutter.project_name }}/  <--------- Project template
│   └── ...
├── blah.txt                      <--------- Non-templated files/dirs
│                                            go outside
│
└── cookiecutter.json             <--------- Prompts & default values
```

You must have:

- A `cookiecutter.json` file.

- A `{{ cookiecutter.project_name }}/` directory, where `project_name` is defined in your `cookiecutter.json`.

Beyond that, you can have whatever files/directories you want.

:::info
 
Cookiecutter runs only on the **Project Template** and use values mentioned in `cookiecutter.json`, hence when you add it on git it's suggested to have **one cookiecutter template per repository** with the `cookiecutter.json` on the root. Also in case you don't want to render a file on the execution of cookiecuuter template, but that file is inside your Project Template, add it under `_copy_without_render` key in your `cookiecutter.json` 

```json
{
    "project_slug": "sample",
    "_copy_without_render": [
        "*.html",
        "*not_rendered_dir",
        "rendered_dir/not_rendered_file.ini"
    ]
}
```

:::

#### Path for Template 

First select the type of the input it could be a [Fixed Value](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/variables-and-expressions/runtime-inputs/#fixed-values), [Runtime input](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/variables-and-expressions/runtime-inputs/#runtime-inputs) or [Expression](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/variables-and-expressions/runtime-inputs/#expressions)

In case of **Fixed Value** provide the absolute value of template URL, for e.g. `https://github.com/devesh-harness/test-cookicutter`

In case of **Runtime Input** provide the absolute value of the template URL after you run the pipeline. 

In case of **Expression** provide the pipeline variable in JEXL format which takes the template URL as an input, this is widely used while implementing the [self-service flow](/docs/internal-developer-portal/tutorials/service-onboarding-pipeline.md#manage-variables-in-the-pipeline).

#### Configure Template

Provide the input required the template in terms of key value pairs in this step.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="YAML" label="YAML">

```YAML
- step:
    type: CookieCutter
    name: CookieCutter
    identifier: idpcookiecutter
    spec:

    publicTemplateUrl: <+pipeline.variables.public_template_url>
    cookieCutterVariables:
        app_name: <+pipeline.variables.project_name>
```


</TabItem>
</Tabs>




### 3. Create Repo

This step is to create the repository in your git provider which will be later used to add the service/app created using cookiecutter step along with the catalog which will be created in the **Create Catalog** step. 

:::warning

In the example provided for this step we have used pipeline variables as input for many fields, make sure you have the corresponding pipeline variable created with proper value [as described under pipeline variables](https://developer.harness.io/docs/internal-developer-portal/flows/idp-stage#pipeline-variables). 

:::

:::info

#### Output

Following is the output variable of this step.

1. **repositoryUrl** : The URL of the repository created eg; `https://github.com/org-name/repo-name` and this variable could be used in other steps in the pipeline by using this **JEXL** expression as a stage variable `<+pipeline.stages.idp.spec.execution.steps.createrepo.output.outputVariables.repositoryUrl>`

These output variable could be viewed under the output tab in 
![](./static/output-createrepo.png)


### 4. Create Catalog

This step is used to create the `catalog-info.yaml/idp.yaml` to be ued to register the software component we have created in previous step in our IDP catalog. 

:::warning

In the example provided for this step we have used pipeline variables as input for many fields, make sure you have the corresponding pipeline variable created with proper value [as described under pipeline variables](https://developer.harness.io/docs/internal-developer-portal/flows/idp-stage#pipeline-variables).

### 5. Direct Push

This step is used to push the `service/application` created using Cookiecutter step along with the `catalog-info.yaml` in the repo you created in previous step. 

:::warning
You can only push the `service/application` created above to repositories within the same project where the **Direct Push** step is being executed.

In the example provided for this step, we have used pipeline variables as input for multiple fields. Ensure that the corresponding pipeline variables are created with the appropriate values, as described in the [Pipeline Variables](https://developer.harness.io/docs/internal-developer-portal/flows/idp-stage#pipeline-variables) documentation.

For GitLab integration, you need to add the [group](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/) path as well. In case of using the personal account, make sure you add the `account-id` in the path

:::

Add the Org, Repo Name, Branch and the File path relative to the root of the repository, where your `catalog-info.yaml` is present.

```YAML
- step:
    type: RegisterCatalog
    name: registercatalog
    identifier: registercatalog
    spec:
    connectorRef: account.testdev
    repository: <+pipeline.variables.project_name>
    organization: <+pipeline.variables.organization>
    filePath: <+pipeline.variables.catalog_file_name>
    branch: <+pipeline.variables.direct_push_branch>
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### API Key Support
Harness IDP now supports the use of a **Harness API Key** in the **Register Catalog** step.

With this feature, users can configure the **API Key** by selecting the **"API Token"** field in the Harness UI. This option is available under **Advanced Settings** in the **Pipelines** tab. Enabling this ensures that the API Key is utilized for catalog registration in IDP.

By integrating the API Key, the pipeline execution remains seamless, ensuring it functions correctly when triggered from another pipeline or through a trigger.

![](./static/api-key-ngui.png)

This step is optional. You can proceed with executing your pipeline without an API key. In that case, the user context will be used for catalog registration.

#### Output Variable

Following is the output variable of this step.

1. **catalogInfoUrl** : The URL of the `catalog-info.yaml` stored in your git provider where you created the repo in the **CreateRepo step** eg; `https://github.com/org-name/repo-name/blob/code/catalog-info.yaml` and this variable could be used in other steps in the pipeline by using this **JEXL** expression as a stage variable `<<+pipeline.stages.idp.spec.execution.steps.registercatalog.output.outputVariables.catalogInfoUrl>>`

These output variable could be viewed under the output tab in

### 7. Slack Notify

This step is used to notify individual developers once the pipeline is executed successfully and your Software component is registered successfully in your Software Catalog. 

:::warning

In the example provided for this step we have used pipeline variables as input for many fields, make sure you have the corresponding pipeline variable created with proper value [as described under pipeline variables](https://developer.harness.io/docs/internal-developer-portal/flows/idp-stage#pipeline-variables). 

:::

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="YAML" label="YAML">

 
```YAML
- step:
    type: SlackNotify
    name: slacknotify
    identifier: slacknotify
    spec:
    emailId: <+pipeline.variables.email_id>
    messageContent: " Hello <+pipeline.variables.project_name> project is created using flows in Harness IDP,\\n*Created Catalog Yaml -* <<+pipeline.stages.serviceonboarding.spec.execution.steps.registercatalog.output.outputVariables.catalogInfoUrl>|Link>\\n*Created Repository -* <<+pipeline.stages.serviceonboarding.spec.execution.steps.createrepo.output.outputVariables.repositoryUrl>|Link>\\n*Registered Catalog -* <<+pipeline.stages.serviceonboarding.spec.execution.steps.createcatalog.output.outputVariables.registeredCatalogUrl>|Link>"
    token: slacksecrettestws
```

The output of the steps like **Create Repo**, **Register Catalog** in the `JEXL` format has been used to construct the `messageContent` for slack notification. 

The `token` is the [Bot-tokens](https://api.slack.com/authentication/token-types#bot) 

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Pipeline Studio" label="Pipeline Studio" default>

1. Add the **Name** of the Step

![](./static/slack-notify-step.png)

The output of the steps like **Create Repo**, **Register Catalog** in the `JEXL` format has been used to construct the `Message` for Slack notification. 

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Slack Email ID

Use the email ID you have used to register in Slack. 

#### Slack secret key

The Slack Secret Key are the [Bot-tokens](https://api.slack.com/authentication/token-types#bot) created with the following permissions. 

1. chat:write
2. chat:write.public
3. users:read.email
4. users:read

![](./static/slack-auth.png)

Read more on [how to create bot-tokens](https://api.slack.com/start/quickstart#scopes). 

1. Now create a new secret and add this as a **Secret** under the **Slack Secret Key**.

### 8. Create Resource

This step in developer portal stage allows you to **execute only OpenTofu (Open Source Terraform) module related to [Harness Terraform Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/harness/harness/latest/docs)** to create or update resources. You can use this step to create Harness entities like projects, users, connectors, pipelines, secrets, etc.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="YAML" label="YAML">

```YAML

                              name: Run_1
                              identifier: Run_1
                              description: <+input>

                    tags: {}
          EOT
        }
      xApiKey: Harness PAT for the account you want to create the pipeline
```
This step comes with a sample **Resource Definition** to create a Harness Pipeline with a Run Step. This contains dummy values, hence won't work consider replacing it with the resource definition of yours. Also refer to [Harness Terraform Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/harness/harness/latest/docs) to help you with Harness Resource definitions.

The `xApiKey` is the [Harness PAT](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/automation/api/add-and-manage-api-keys/) for the account where you want to create the pipeline.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Pipeline Studio" label="Pipeline Studio" default>

- You can select the step **Create Resource** from the **Step Library**. 

![](./static/create-resourcesl.png)

- You can add a **Name** to the step followed by adding the **Resource Definition** and create a Harness Entity using Resources supported by our [Harness Terraform Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/harness/harness/latest/docs). Likewise, you'll find an already existing sample **Resource Definition** by default, that can create a Harness Pipeline with a **Run Step**.

### 9. Update Catalog Property

This step is used to update the catalog metadata for your entities. For example, you want to add the latest build version for your service in your catalog using this step in your CI pipeline and update the data in your catalog. 

- You can select the step **Update Catalog Property** from the **Step Library**. 

![](./static/update-catalog-property.png)

- Now under the **Select the Catalog entity and the properties to be updated** you have two options
  - Update single Catalog Entity
  - Update multiple catalog Entities

- **Permission:** For anyone to update catalog property need to have [edit catalog permission](https://developer.harness.io/docs/internal-developer-portal/rbac/resources-roles#catalog-access-policies). 

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Update a single Catalog Entity" label="Update a single Catalog Entity">

- To **update a single Catalog Entity**, select the Catalog Entity from the dropdown. You need to type at least the first three characters in the field for the entity options to appear.

![](./static/ucp-demo.gif)

- Now add the **property**, you want to update/add and the **value** against it. e.g., `<+metadata.testCoverage>`, `<+metadata.additionalInfo.onShorelead>`. 

- The **API Key** field is optional. If left empty, the credentials of the user executing the pipeline will be used to update the catalog entity.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Update Multiple Catalog Entities" label="Update Multiple Catalog Entities" default>

- To **update multiple Catalog entities**, you need to add the **property** to be updated across the entities followed by `entity-ref` and corresponding values. 

- In case you want to add a default value across all the entities then update the field under Default Value.

- The **API Key** field is optional. If left empty, the credentials of the user executing the pipeline will be used to update the catalog entity.

- Under Advanced you can select the mode 

  - Available Modes:
    - replace (default): Completely replaces the existing value with the new one provided in the value field.
    - append: Adds new values to the existing array (or other types to be appended like maps or key-value pairs).
  
> Note: `append` only works with data types that can hold multiple values, such as arrays or maps. It does not apply to simple data types like strings.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 10. Run Step
You can use the **Run step** to to run commands or scripts in your Harness Pipeline. 

In order for the Run step to execute your commands, the build environment must have the necessary binaries for those commands. Depending on the stage's build infrastructure, Run steps can use binaries that exist in the build environment or pull an image, such as a public or private Docker image, that contains the required binaries.

Please refer to detailed steps and settings here to understand this step in detail: [Run Step Settings](https://developer.harness.io/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/run-step-settings#run-step-settings)

### 11. Plugin Step
You can use the **Plugin step** to run different plugins in your Harness Pipeline. 

Please refer to detailed steps and settings here to understand this step in detail: [Plugin Step Settings](https://developer.harness.io/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/use-drone-plugins/plugin-step-settings-reference/)

## Specify the Harness IDP Images used in your Pipeline

You can use the Harness IDP `execution-config` API to specify or update the Harness IDP images used in your infrastructure by specifying image tags.

:::info

Certain steps are common across different stages in Harness Pipeline, but the images used in each of them is specific to the stage they are part of, like `Run Step`.

:::

Here's a list of Harness IDP images used in the IDP stage: 
1. [``cookieCutter``](https://console.cloud.google.com/gcr/images/gcr-prod/global/harness/cookiecutter): Used to take inputs for the cookiecutter template.
2. [``createRepo``](https://console.cloud.google.com/gcr/images/gcr-prod/global/harness/createrepo): Used to create the repository in your git provider
3. [``directPush``](https://console.cloud.google.com/gcr/images/gcr-prod/global/harness/directpush): Used to push the service/application created using Cookiecutter step along with the catalog-info.yaml in the repo you created in previous step.
4. [``registerCatalog``](https://console.cloud.google.com/gcr/images/gcr-prod/global/harness/registercatalog?project=gcr-prod): Used to register the software component created in the Harness IDP Catalog. 
5. [``slackNotify``](https://console.cloud.google.com/gcr/images/gcr-prod/global/harness/slacknotify): Used to notify individual developers once the pipeline is executed successfully and your Software component is registered successfully in your Software Catalog.
6. [``createResource``](https://console.cloud.google.com/gcr/images/gcr-prod/global/harness/createresource): Used to create Harness entities like projects, users, connectors, pipelines, secrets, etc.
7. [``updateCatalogProperty``](https://console.cloud.google.com/gcr/images/gcr-prod/global/harness/updatecatalogproperty): Used to update the catalog metadata for your entities
8. [``createOrganisation``](https://console.cloud.google.com/gcr/images/gcr-prod/global/harness/createorganisation)
9. [``createProject``](https://console.cloud.google.com/gcr/images/gcr-prod/global/harness/createproject)
10. [``createCatalog``](https://console.cloud.google.com/gcr/images/gcr-prod/global/harness/createcatalog)


API key authentication is required. For more information about API keys, go to [Manage API keys](/docs/platform/automation/api/add-and-manage-api-keys). For more information about authentication, go to the [Harness API documentation](https://apidocs.harness.io/#section/Introduction/Authentication).

1. Send a `get-default-config` request to get a list of the latest Harness IDP Workflows executed. You can use the `infra` parameter to get `k8` images or `VM` images.

   ```json
   curl --location --request GET "https://app.harness.io/gateway/idp/execution-config/get-default-config?accountIdentifier=$YOUR_HARNESS_ACCOUNT_ID&infra=K8" \
   --header 'X-API-KEY: $API_KEY'
   ```

   The response payload shows the latest supported images and their tags, for example:

   ```json
   {
    "status": "SUCCESS",
     "data": {
        "cookieCutter": "harness/cookiecutter:1.9.1",
        "createRepo": "harness/createrepo:1.9.0",
        "directPush": "harness/directpush:1.9.0",
        "registerCatalog": "harness/registercatalog:1.9.0",
        "createCatalog": "harness/createcatalog:1.9.0",
        "slackNotify": "harness/slacknotify:1.9.0",
        "createOrganisation": "harness/createorganisation:1.9.0",
        "createProject": "harness/createproject:1.9.0"
     },
     "metaData": null,
     "correlationId": "08919155-a6d6-4bd3-8401-6b86318c85ca"
   }
   ```

2. Send a `get-customer-config` request to get the build images that your IDP pipelines currently use. When `overridesOnly` is `true`, which is the default value, this endpoint returns the non-default images that your pipeline uses.

   ```json
   curl --location --request GET "https://app.harness.io/gateway/idp/execution-config/get-customer-config?accountIdentifier=$YOUR_HARNESS_ACCOUNT_ID&infra=K8&overridesOnly=true" \
   --header 'X-API-KEY: $API_KEY'
   ```

   If the response contains `null`, your pipeline is using all default images, for example:

   ```json
   {
       "status": "SUCCESS",
       "data": {},
       "metaData": null,
       "correlationId": "11ce1bc8-b337-4687-9ab9-e13d553ae82f"
   }
   ```

3. Send a `update-config` (POST) request with a list of the images you want to update and the new tags to apply.

   ```json
   curl --location --request POST "https://app.harness.io/gateway/idp/execution-config/update-config?accountIdentifier=$YOUR_HARNESS_ACCOUNT_ID&infra=K8" \
   --header 'X-API-KEY: $API_KEY' \
   --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
   --data-raw '[
       {
           "field": "registerCatalog",
           "value": "harness/registercatalog:1.9.0"
       },
       {
