## Introduction

:::info

Presently this Feature is behind the Feature Flag `IDP_ENABLE_STAGE`, please contact with [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io) to enable it in your Account. 

:::

The self-service flow in IDP is powered by the Harness Pipelines. A stage is a part of a pipeline that contains the logic to perform a major segment of a larger workflow defined in a pipeline. Stages are often based on the different workflow milestones, such as building, approving, and delivering.

The process of adding a stage to a pipeline is the same for all Harness modules. When you add a stage to a pipeline, you select the stage type, such as **Developer Portal** for IDP or **Build** for CI or **Deploy** for CD. The available stage settings are determined by the stage type, and, if applicable, the module associated with the selected stage type.

This functionality is limited to the modules and settings that you have access to.

## How to Add the Developer Portal Stage


<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Present Nav" label="Present Nav" default>

1. Go to **Projects** and Select your project and create a new pipeline.

  <TabItem value="New Nav" label="New Nav">

1. Go to **Pipelines** under **Admin** from side nav and **Create a Pipeline**. 

![](./static/n-p-snav.png)


</TabItem>
</Tabs>


2. Add a Name for your Pipeline and select **Inline** as pipeline storage options.

![](./static/inline.png)

3. Now **Select Stage Type** as **Developer Portal** and add a [name for your stage](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/pipelines/add-a-stage/#stage-names) to **Set Up Stage**.

![](./static/dev-portal-stage-selection.png)

![](./static/set-up-stage.png)

## Infrastructure

4. Under **Infrastructure** tab, Harness recommends [Harness Cloud](https://developer.harness.io/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/set-up-build-infrastructure/use-harness-cloud-build-infrastructure#use-harness-cloud), but you can also use a [Kubernetes cluster](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/set-up-build-infrastructure/k8s-build-infrastructure/set-up-a-kubernetes-cluster-build-infrastructure), [local runner](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/set-up-build-infrastructure/define-a-docker-build-infrastructure) or [self-managed AWS/GCP/Azure VM](/docs/category/set-up-vm-build-infrastructures) build infrastructure.

![](./static/infrastructure.png)

## Pipeline Variables

5. Before adding the execution steps we need to create some **[pipeline variables](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/variables-and-expressions/add-a-variable/)** with [runtime inputs](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/variables-and-expressions/runtime-inputs/#runtime-inputs) which we will be using as **[expression inputs](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/variables-and-expressions/runtime-inputs/#expressions)** in various steps under execution. 

6. To add pipeline variables go to the right nav of your pag and select **Variables** icon.

7. Under **Custom Variables** select **+Add Variable**.

8. Add a name to the variable and select the input type as **Runtime**.


![](./static/add-pipeline-variable.png)

To use the pipeline variable select the input type as **Expressions** and follow the [JEXL format](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/variables-and-expressions/add-a-variable/#reference-variables-in-a-pipeline) to add the variable. 

![](./static/add-repo-details.png)

## Execution Steps

9. Now add the steps under the **Execution Tab**. The following is the list of suggested steps to be used in the execution.

![](./static/idp-stage.png)

### 1. Add the Git Clone step (Ignore this step if your repository containing cookiecutter template is public)

Add a Git Clone step to clone a repository into the Developer Portal stage's workspace.

By cloning the repository, you gain access to the necessary code, scripts, or configurations, enabling you to perform various actions.

The Git Clone step uses a containerized step group. For more information, go to [Containerize step groups](/docs/continuous-delivery/x-platform-cd-features/cd-steps/containerized-steps/containerized-step-groups.md).

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Pipeline Studio" label="Pipeline Studio" default>

![](./static/git-clone.png)


1. In your Developer Portal stage, in **Execution**, select **Add Step**.
2. Select **Git Clone**.
3. Configure the steps using the settings described below.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="YAML" label="YAML">

```YAML
- step:
   type: GitClone
   name: GitClone_1
   identifier: GitClone_1
   spec:
     connectorRef: account.GitConnectorBzGN8G1COj
     repoName: myrepo
     build:
       type: branch
       spec:
         branch: main
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Select Git Provider

Select the Git Provider as **Third-party Git Provider** in case you don't have your code in [**Harness Code Repository**](https://developer.harness.io/docs/code-repository/) 


#### Connector

:::info

Presently for Connectors the `connection type` **ssh** is not supported and for `credentials` only **Username and Password** type is supported. 

![](./static/details-git-conector.png)
![](./static/creds-git-connector.png)

::: 

Select a connector for the source control provider hosting the code repository that you want the step to clone.

The following topics provide more information about creating code repo connectors:

* Azure Repos: [Connect to Azure Repos](/docs/platform/connectors/code-repositories/connect-to-a-azure-repo)
* Bitbucket: [Bitbucket connector settings reference](/docs/platform/connectors/code-repositories/ref-source-repo-provider/bitbucket-connector-settings-reference)
* GitHub: [GitHub connector settings reference](/docs/platform/connectors/code-repositories/ref-source-repo-provider/git-hub-connector-settings-reference)
* GitLab: [GitLab Connector Settings reference](/docs/platform/connectors/code-repositories/ref-source-repo-provider/git-lab-connector-settings-reference)
* Other Git providers:
  * [Git connector settings reference](/docs/platform/connectors/code-repositories/ref-source-repo-provider/git-connector-settings-reference)
  * [Connect to an AWS CodeCommit Repo](/docs/platform/connectors/code-repositories/connect-to-code-repo)

#### Repository Name

If the connector's [URL Type](/docs/platform/connectors/code-repositories/ref-source-repo-provider/git-connector-settings-reference#url-type) is **Repository**, then **Repository Name** is automatically populated based on the repository defined in the connector's configuration.

If the connector's URL Type is **Account**, then you must specify the name of the code repository that you want to clone into the stage workspace.

#### Build Type, Branch Name, and Tag Name

For **Build Type**, select **Git Branch** if you want the step to clone code from a specific branch within the repository, or select **Git Tag** if you want the step to clone code from a specific commit tag. Based on your selection, specify a **Branch Name** or **Tag Name**.

:::tip

You can use [fixed values, runtime input, or variable expressions](/docs/platform/variables-and-expressions/runtime-inputs/) for the branch and tag names. For example, you can enter `<+input>` for the branch or tag name to supply a branch or tag name at runtime.

:::

#### Clone directory

An optional target path in the stage workspace where you want to clone the repo.

#### Depth

The number of commits to fetch when the step clones the repo.

The default depth is `0`, which fetches all commits from the relevant branch.

For more information, go to the [git clone documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone).

### 2. Cookiecutter

Cookiecutter step is used to take inputs for the cookiecutter template. 

:::warning

In the example provided for this step we have used pipeline variables as input for many fields, make sure you have the corresponding pipeline variable created with proper value [as described under pipeline variables](https://developer.harness.io/docs/internal-developer-portal/flows/idp-stage#pipeline-variables). 

:::

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Pipeline Studio" label="Pipeline Studio" default>

![](./static/cookicutter.png)

#### Repository Type

Select the repository type in which your template is stored, which could be public or private git repository. 

:::info

In case it's **Private** make sure you have added the **gitclone step** and the **path for template** should be the **Clone Directory** added in **gitclone step**

In case of public templates you just need to add the public URL of the template path stored in your git provider. eg `https://github.com/devesh-harness/test-cookicutter`

:::

#### Path for Template 

First select the type of the input it could be a [Fixed Value](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/variables-and-expressions/runtime-inputs/#fixed-values), [Runtime input](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/variables-and-expressions/runtime-inputs/#runtime-inputs) or [Expression](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/variables-and-expressions/runtime-inputs/#expressions)

In case of **Fixed Value** provide the absolute value of template URL, for eg. `https://github.com/devesh-harness/test-cookicutter`

In case of **Runtime Input** provide the absolute value of the template URL after you run the pipeline. 

In case of **Expression** provide the pipeline variable in JEXL format which takes the template URL as an input, this is widely used while implementing the [self service flow](/docs/internal-developer-portal/tutorials/service-onboarding-pipeline.md#manage-variables-in-the-pipeline).

#### Configure Template

Provide the input required the template in terms of key value pairs in this step. 

![](./static/key-value-cookiecutter.png)


</TabItem>
<TabItem value="YAML" label="YAML">

```YAML
- step:
    type: CookieCutter
    name: CookieCutter
    identifier: idpcookiecutter
    spec:
    templateType: public
    publicTemplateUrl: <+pipeline.variables.public_template_url>
    cookieCutterVariables:
        app_name: <+pipeline.variables.project_name>
```


</TabItem>
</Tabs>


### 3. Create Repo

This step is to create the repository in your git provider which will be later used to add the service/app created using cookiecutter step along with the catalog which will be created in the **Create Catalog** step. 

:::warning

In the example provided for this step we have used pipeline variables as input for many fields, make sure you have the corresponding pipeline variable created with proper value [as described under pipeline variables](https://developer.harness.io/docs/internal-developer-portal/flows/idp-stage#pipeline-variables). 

:::

:::info

The git connector used under **[Connectors Page](https://developer.harness.io/docs/internal-developer-portal/get-started/onboarding-guide#connector-setup)** in IDP Admin should have fetch access to the repository getting created in this step. 

:::

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Pipeline Studio" label="Pipeline Studio" default>

      xApiKey: Harness PAT for the account you want to create the pipeline
```
This step comes with a sample **Resource Definition** to create a Harness Pipeline with a Run Step. This contains dummy values, hence won't work consider replacing it with the resource definition of yours. Also refer to [Harness Terraform Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/harness/harness/latest/docs) to help you with Harness Resource definitions.

The `xApiKey` is the [Harness PAT](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/automation/api/add-and-manage-api-keys/) for the account where you want to create the pipeline.

- You can add a **Name** to the step followed by adding the **Resource Definition** and create a Harness Entity using Resources supported by our [Harness Terraform Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/harness/harness/latest/docs). You'll find an already existing sample **Resource Definition** by default, that can create a Harness Pipeline with a **Run Step**.

## Final Pipeline using Developer Portal Stage

:::info

We have been using **Expression** for most of the input values like `<+pipeline.variables.email_id>` to be able to provide these values from the templates in the form of `email_id: ${{ parameters.emailid }}` 

Example

```YAML
spec:
...
  parameters:
    - title: Service Details
      required:
        - emailid
        - triggerName
      properties:
        emailid:
          title: Enter your Email ID
          type: string
          description: The email ID in slack
...
...
  steps:
    - id: trigger
      name: Creating your react app
      action: trigger:harness-custom-pipeline
      input:
        url: ""
        email_id: ${{ parameters.emailid }}
...

## Specify the Harness IDP images used in your pipelines

You can use the Harness IDP `execution-config` API to specify or update the Harness IDP images used in your infrastructure by specifying image tags.

:::info

Certain steps are common across different stages in Harness Pipeline but the images used in each of them is specific to the stage they are part of, like `Run Step`.

:::

API key authentication is required. For more information about API keys, go to [Manage API keys](/docs/platform/automation/api/add-and-manage-api-keys). For more information about authentication, go to the [Harness API documentation](https://apidocs.harness.io/#section/Introduction/Authentication).

1. Send a `get-default-config` request to get a list of the latest Harness IDP worklfows excuted. You can use the `infra` parameter to get `k8` images or `VM` images.

   ```json
   curl --location --request GET "https://app.harness.io/gateway/idp/execution-config/get-default-config?accountIdentifier=$YOUR_HARNESS_ACCOUNT_ID&infra=K8" \
   --header 'X-API-KEY: $API_KEY'
   ```

   The response payload shows the latest supported images and their tags, for example:

   ```json
   {
    "status": "SUCCESS",
     "data": {
        "cookieCutter": "harness/cookiecutter:1.9.1",
        "createRepo": "harness/createrepo:1.9.0",
        "directPush": "harness/directpush:1.9.0",
        "registerCatalog": "harness/registercatalog:1.9.0",
        "createCatalog": "harness/createcatalog:1.9.0",
        "slackNotify": "harness/slacknotify:1.9.0",
        "createOrganisation": "harness/createorganisation:1.9.0",
        "createProject": "harness/createproject:1.9.0"
     },
     "metaData": null,
     "correlationId": "08919155-a6d6-4bd3-8401-6b86318c85ca"
   }
   ```

2. Send a `get-customer-config` request to get the build images that your IDP pipelines currently use. When `overridesOnly` is `true`, which is the default value, this endpoint returns the non-default images that your pipeline uses.

   ```json
   curl --location --request GET "https://app.harness.io/gateway/idp/execution-config/get-customer-config?accountIdentifier=$YOUR_HARNESS_ACCOUNT_ID&infra=K8&overridesOnly=true" \
   --header 'X-API-KEY: $API_KEY'
   ```

   If the response contains `null`, your pipeline is using all default images, for example:

   ```json
   {
       "status": "SUCCESS",
       "data": {},
       "metaData": null,
       "correlationId": "11ce1bc8-b337-4687-9ab9-e13d553ae82f"
   }
   ```

3. Send an `update-config` (POST) request with a list of the images you want to update and the new tags to apply.

   ```json
   curl --location --request POST "https://app.harness.io/gateway/idp/execution-config/update-config?accountIdentifier=$YOUR_HARNESS_ACCOUNT_ID&infra=K8" \
   --header 'X-API-KEY: $API_KEY' \
   --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
   --data-raw '[
       {
           "field": "registerCatalog",
           "value": "harness/registercatalog:1.9.0"
       },
       {
           "field": "slackNotify",
           "value": "harness/slacknotify:1.9.0"
       }
   ]'
   ```

4. To reset one or more images to their defaults, send a `reset-config` (POST) request with a list of the images to reset.

   ```json
   curl --location --request POST "https://app.harness.io/gateway/idp/execution-config/reset-config?accountIdentifier=$YOUR_HARNESS_ACCOUNT_ID&infra=K8" \
   --header 'X-API-KEY: $API_KEY' \
   --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
   --data-raw '[
       {
           "field": "registerCatalog"
       },
       {
           "field": "createRepo"
       }
   ]'
   ```
