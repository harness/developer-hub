## Before You Upgrade (Checklist)

Before upgrading to **IDP 2.0**, carefully review the checklist below to understand key changes and ensure a smooth, well-planned migration.

1. **Review Breaking Changes**:
   Begin by thoroughly reviewing the [Breaking Changes](/docs/internal-developer-portal/idp-2o-overview/2-0-overview-and-upgrade-path.md#breaking-changes-in-idp-20) guide.
   IDP 2.0 introduces several significant updates that differ from the IDP 1.0 architecture. Since **rolling back is not straightforward**, it is essential to carefully evaluate all changes before proceeding.

2. **Evaluate Impact on Your Current Setup**:
   Assess how these changes‚Äîsuch as the new data model and removal of legacy entities‚Äîwill affect your existing configuration.
   We recommend reviewing [Phase 1 of the Upgrade Path](/docs/internal-developer-portal/idp-2o-overview/migrating-idp-2o.md#phase-1-prepare--assess) for a clear understanding of what to expect and how to prepare.

3. **Confirm You're Ready**:
   Ensure your team is ready for onboarding by checking the [Feature Compatibility](/docs/internal-developer-portal/idp-2o-overview/2-0-overview-and-upgrade-path.md#feature-compatibility-matrix-10-vs-20) list and understanding [what is currently supported](/docs/internal-developer-portal/idp-2o-overview/2-0-overview-and-upgrade-path.md) in IDP 2.0.
   Since 2.0 is available to all users and not easily reversible, proceed only when confident in your readiness.

4. **Use a Test Account**:
   If possible, explore IDP 2.0 in a **dedicated test account** before deploying to production.
   Don‚Äôt have one? Reach out to [Harness Support](https://support.harness.io) to request access.

5. **Focus on Key Use Cases First**:
   Identify your team's **core use cases** where IDP 2.0 delivers the most value, and begin rollout there.
   A **gradual migration strategy** allows smoother adoption and easier troubleshooting.

6. **Connect with the Harness IDP Team**:
   Have questions or unique use cases? We‚Äôre here to help. Reach out to the [Harness IDP Team](https://support.harness.io) to get guidance tailored to your organization‚Äôs needs.

## Upgrade Path & Rollout Strategy

To help ensure a seamless transition from IDP 1.0 to 2.0, follow the structured seven-step upgrade process outlined below. Before you begin, make sure you‚Äôve completed the prerequisite checklist above.

### Step 1: Prepare & Assess

Before upgrading to IDP 2.0, ensure you‚Äôve reviewed the [Before You Upgrade Checklist](/docs/internal-developer-portal/idp-2o-overview/migrating-idp-2o.md#before-you-upgrade-checklist) and are fully prepared to onboard.

Please complete the following steps:

- **Review All Breaking Changes**:
  Go through the [breaking changes](/docs/internal-developer-portal/idp-2o-overview/2-0-overview-and-upgrade-path.md#breaking-changes-in-idp-20) introduced in IDP 2.0‚Äîincluding structural changes to the Catalog, introduction of platform-level Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), and enhancements to the Git Experience.

  > ‚ö†Ô∏è Rollback is not straightforward, so it's critical to thoroughly understand the scope and impact of these changes.

- **Evaluate Your Current Setup**:
  Analyze how these changes will affect your current configuration. Identify all impacted features, entities, and workflows. Here are a few scenarios to consider:

  - If you're using **Harness IDP 1.0 APIs** (Backstage Catalog APIs):
    These will continue to work temporarily but will be **deprecated by the end of October**. You‚Äôll need to transition to the newer APIs.

  - If your current setup includes **System** or **Domain** entities:
    These are no longer supported in IDP 2.0. During the migration process, they will be **discarded**. To continue using these entities, you'll need to recreate them using the updated data model. We're working on introducing a similar System entity in IDP 2.0 by end of July 2025.

  - If you used **`hidden`** or **`private`** tags for any entity or workflow:
    These tags are not supported in IDP 2.0. Instead, configure **RBAC** and recreate your entities at the appropriate scope (Account, Org, or Project) with correct roles and permissions.

---

### Step 2: Check Feature Compatibility with IDP 1.0

In addition to exploring new features, it‚Äôs essential to understand which IDP 1.0 features are still supported, changed, or deprecated.

- Use the [Feature Compatibility Matrix](/docs/internal-developer-portal/idp-2o-overview/2-0-overview-and-upgrade-path.md#feature-compatibility-matrix-10-vs-20) to compare features across versions.
- This helps ensure continuity of your existing workflows and smooth transition to IDP 2.0.

---

### Step 3: Enable IDP 2.0

Once you‚Äôre confident about upgrading:

- **Submit a Support Ticket**:
  Raise a ticket with [Harness Support](https://support.harness.io) to enable the `IDP_2_0` feature flag on your account.

- **Join an Upgrade Call (Early Access Customers)**:
  Our team will schedule a call with you to walk through the upgrade process and enable the feature flag.

- **Enable in a Test Environment First (Recommended)**:
  If you have a **test or staging environment**, enable IDP 2.0 there first. This allows your team to safely explore the new experience before enabling it in production.

---

### Step 4: Upgrade

Once the feature flag is enabled, your account will undergo the following changes:

#### üóÇÔ∏è Migration to Harness-native Data Model

- All your existing entities will automatically migrate to the new **Harness-native Data Model** under the **Account** scope as **inline entities**.
- Existing YAML files (`catalog-info.yaml`) will no longer be connected to these entities. You can either **discard them** or **retain them for archival** purposes.

#### üîÑ Migrating Workflows

- All **Workflows**, including those marked with the `hidden` tag, will automatically migrate to the Harness-native schema at the **Account level**.
- By default, all users will be able to **view** these workflows, but will **not** be able to **execute** them.

**Action Items:**

1. **Clean Up Experimental Workflows**:

   - Identify hidden or experimental workflows.
   - Move them to the **Project scope** (if any) if you don‚Äôt want all account users to see them:
     - Copy the workflow YAML.
     - Create a new workflow at the desired project level.
     - Delete the original Account-level workflow.

2. **Grant Execute Access for Remaining Workflows**: (Learn more about configuring [Workflows RBAC](/docs/internal-developer-portal/rbac/workflow-rbac.md))
   - Create a role named **"IDP Workflow Executors"** or modify an existing role.
   - Add **‚ÄúWorkflow - View and Execute‚Äù** permissions.
   - Do **not** include create/edit permissions to restrict modifications.
   - Assign this role to **‚ÄúAll Account Users‚Äù** with **‚ÄúAccount level resources‚Äù** (avoid ‚ÄúAccount level including child scopes‚Äù).

#### üîÑ Migrating Catalog Entities

- All entities will migrate to the **Account level** as **inline entities**.
- Like workflows, existing `catalog-info.yaml` files will no longer be linked. These can be retained for reference or discarded.
- Once the **Git Experience** is released, you‚Äôll be able to commit these entities to a Git repository as YAML files.

**Action Items:**

1. **Entity Cleanup & Restructuring:**

   - For **private or shared services**, reorganize them into appropriate **Projects or Org scopes**:
     - Copy the entity YAML.
     - Recreate it under the desired scope (e.g., Project).
     - Delete the original Account-level entity.

2. **Configure Catalog RBAC:** (Learn more about configuring [Catalog RBAC](/docs/internal-developer-portal/rbac/catalog-rbac.md))
   - To control access to these entities:
     - Start setting up **Catalog RBAC**.
     - Define appropriate roles and permissions for users who need access to account-level catalog entities.

#### üîß Move to Newer APIs (Post-Migration)

After upgrading to IDP 2.0, you can begin using the **newer API endpoints**. Although existing APIs will continue to work temporarily, they will be deprecated by **end of October**.

**Action Items:**

- For pipelines using the **"register catalog"** step or any **legacy IDP 1.0 APIs**, migrate to the new APIs:

  - Update the YAML directly (refer to the guide [here](/docs/internal-developer-portal/catalog/catalog-yaml.md)).
  - Or use the new `POST /entities` API endpoint (guide available here).

---

### Step 5: Test and Validate

- Validate UI behavior: create, update, and delete entities using the new UI experience.
- Test platform-level RBAC to ensure permissions are properly enforced.
- Verify the new Git Experience features, including webhook-based syncing and branching workflows.
- Confirm workflow behavior across different scopes (Account, Org, Project).

---

### Step 6: Gradual Rollout

- Begin rolling out the upgraded platform to selected teams or use-cases.
- Monitor for issues or regressions, and collect feedback from early users.

---

### Step 7: Store Entity YAMLs in Git

:::info Note
With the new IDP 2.0, one entity can have only one YAML file. Unlike IDP 1.0, storing multiple entities within a single YAML is no longer supported in IDP 2.0. This design choice is _in line_ with the rest of the Harness platform, which emphasizes clarity and consistency through single-entity YAML definitions. To understand more about this and other key differences, see the [breaking changes in IDP 2.0](https://developer.harness.io/docs/internal-developer-portal/idp-2o-overview/2-0-overview-and-upgrade-path#breaking-changes-in-idp-20).
:::

**Upgrading from IDP 1.0 to IDP 2.0 will result in all your entities being created as Inline Entities** (i.e., with all the Entity YAMLs stored in the Harness Database). In case you want to store these Entity YAMLs in Git and convert them from Inline to Remote Entities (i.e., with all the Entity YAMLs stored in Git), you can make use of the **Harness IDP Git Experience** feature. Here's how you can convert the entities:

- **Convert your entities and store YAMLs in Git from your Harness IDP UI directly.** Refer to these docs on [converting Inline IDP Entities to Remote Entities](/docs/internal-developer-portal/git-experience/gitx-journey.md#converting-inline-to-remote-entity).
- **Use the following script to convert your Inline Entities to Remote Entities directly in bulk.**

:::info Pre-requisites
Ensure you set the following variables before you run the script i.e. `HARNESS_ACCOUNT`, `X_API_KEY`, `CONNECTOR_REF`, `REPO_NAME` and `BRANCH_NAME`.
