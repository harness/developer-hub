## Before You Upgrade (Checklist)

Before upgrading to **IDP 2.0**, carefully review the checklist below to understand key changes and ensure a smooth and well-planned migration.

1. **Review Breaking Changes**
   Begin by thoroughly reviewing the [Breaking Changes](/docs/internal-developer-portal/idp-2o-overview/2-0-overview-and-upgrade-path.md#breaking-changes-in-idp-20) guide. IDP 2.0 introduces several major updates that significantly differ from the IDP 1.0 architecture and workflows.

2. **Assess Impacted Areas**
   Evaluate how these changes affect your current setup. For example, IDP 2.0 introduces a new Harness-native Data Model and removes entities like **System** and **Domain**.

3. **Use a Test Account**
   Test IDP 2.0 in a dedicated account before upgrading in your production environment. If you need access, contact [Harness Support](https://support.harness.io).

4. **Focus on Key Use Cases**
   Identify core use cases where IDP 2.0 adds the most value and start implementation there. A gradual rollout ensures smoother adoption.

5. **Talk to the Harness IDP Team for Specific Use Cases**: We‚Äôre excited to launch IDP 2.0 and want to make your transition as smooth as possible. If you have specific use cases or want to better understand how IDP 2.0 can support your team, feel free to reach out to the Harness IDP team [here].

## Upgrade Path & Rollout Strategy

To help ensure a seamless transition from IDP 1.0 to 2.0, follow the structured six-phase upgrade process outlined below. Before you begin, make sure you‚Äôve completed the prerequisite checklist above.

We‚Äôre excited to launch IDP 2.0 and want to make your transition as smooth as possible. If you want to **prepare and start assessing IDP 2.0** for your needs, please feel free to **schedule a call** with the **Harness IDP team**. Reach out to us here. 

### Phase 1: Prepare & Assess

* **Review all breaking changes** introduced in IDP 2.0, including structural changes to the Catalog, platform-level Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), and enhanced Git Experience.
* **Evaluate and your current setup** and assess how IDP 2.0 impacts it. Identify all features, entities, and workflows that may be affected.

  * For instance, if your existing setup uses **System** and **Domain** entities, note that these are deprecated in IDP 2.0. Their functionality is now covered by Harness Projects and Organizations.

### Phase 2: Check Feature Compatibility with IDP 1.0

In addition to new capabilities, it‚Äôs important to understand which features from IDP 1.0 remain supported, have changed, or are no longer available. Refer to the matrix below to compare features across versions.

### Phase 3: Enable Feature Flag

* Contact Harness Support to enable the `IDP_2_0` feature flag on your account.
* If you have a test or staging environment, enable the feature there first to explore and verify the upgrade safely.

### Phase 4: Upgrade

* Once the feature flag is enabled, your existing entities will automatically migrate to the new Harness-native data model at the **Account** level.
* To reorganize entities under a different scope (e.g., Project or Org), you will need to:
  * Delete the entity from the Account scope
  * Re-create it under the desired scope
* The same applies to workflows not yet ready for global use.
* Update any automation scripts or tools that depend on IDP APIs or YAML definitions to reflect the new model.
* (Optional) Use migration tooling to adopt the enhanced Git Experience and commit YAML files directly into Git repositories.

### Phase 5: Test and Validate

* Validate UI behavior: create, update, and delete entities using the new UI experience.
* Test platform-level RBAC to ensure permissions are properly enforced.
* Verify the new Git Experience features, including webhook-based syncing and branching workflows.
* Confirm workflow behavior across different scopes (Account, Org, Project).

### Phase 6: Gradual Rollout

* Begin rolling out the upgraded platform to selected teams or use-cases.
* Monitor for issues or regressions, and collect feedback from early users.
* IDP 1.0 fallback is supported during the migration window, so you can switch back temporarily if needed while completing validation.

## Unlock These Features with the IDP 2.0 Upgrade

By upgrading to IDP 2.0, you gain access to:

* Harness-native Platform Hierarchy
* Granular platform-level RBAC
* Bi-direction Git sync of entity YAML files
* Easier automation without manual YAML operations
* New Catalog & Workflow UI
* and many more exciting features.

## Timeline
- IDP 2.0 will be Generally Available by end of Q2 (July 2025)
- All IDP 1.0 APIs are removed by end of Q3 (October 2025)
- All customers will be moved over to IDP 2.0 by end of October 2025.
