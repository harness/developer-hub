Harness IDP allows you to integrate various data sources and implement custom checks to ensure your software components adhere to best practices and compliance. In this docs, we'll walk through how to add custom checks and data sources for [scorecards](https://developer.harness.io/docs/internal-developer-portal/features/scorecard) in Harness IDP.

### Overview

Harness IDP allows you to integrate various data sources, such as GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Azure DevOps, and many more, to collect specific data points for each software component. Once a data source is enabled, you can use them to create checks to be used in scorecards.

### Add Custom Checks

1. Under the `Admin` go to `Scorecards`.
2. In the `Scorecards` go to the `Checks` tab and select **Create Custom Check**.
3. Now on the **Create Check** page add a name and description for your check.
4. Under **Rules** you can find the following Data Sources to select from.

:::info

There's a tab called `Data Sources` available in `Scorecards` page to check for supported data sources and the corresponding data points. 

:::

:::warning

The git (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) datasources doesn't support monorepos.

:::

### Supported Operators

We support the following `regex operators` as Operators for all the Data Points.

1. Less Than
2. Less than or equal to
3. Greater than
4. Greater than or equal to 
5. Equal to
6. Not equal to
7. In or Match
8. Not-In or Not-Match
9. Starts With

### Support for `catalog-info.yaml` metadata as inputs.

Users can now use the entities `annotation` and `harnessData` from `catalog-info.yaml` as input variable(JEXL format) in Scorecard Checks. eg., `<+metadata.harnessData.name>` will fetch the value for the branch in the following YAML as `catalog-info.yaml`.

```YAML
...
metadata:
  name: idp-module
  harnessData:
    name: idp-module-prod
    path: idp
    priority: P0,P1
  annotations:
    jira/project-key: IDP
...
```

:::info

Few datasources like **PagerDuty**, **Kubernetes** are dependant on the Plugins to fetch data using the annotations meant for the plugins in `catalog-info.yaml` as well as the proxy defined in the plugins section.

## Harness 

### Pre-Requisites

- For the functioning of Harness Data Source related checks, the Harness CI/CD plugin should be configured with new annotations in catalog info YAML, `harness.io/pipelines` and `harness.io/services` as mentioned in the setup steps instruction of [Harness CI/CD plugin](https://github.com/harness/backstage-plugins/tree/main/plugins/harness-ci-cd#harness-nextgen-cicd-plugin)

:::info

In the Harness Data source, the first pipeline URL from `harness.io/pipelines` is considered for score computation and similarly, the first service URL from `harness.io/services` is considered.

:::

The following **Data Points** are available for Harness Data Source. 

1. **CI Pipeline success rate (last 7 days)**: 
- *Objective:* Used for creating rules that will check the success percent of the ci-pipeline in the past 7 days. (This data point is only applicable for CI Pipelines).
- *Calculation Method:* The success rate is calculated only on CI Pipeline that we provide in catalog info YAML with annotation is considered for evaluating the check.

![](./static/ci-harness.png)

2. **Policy evaluation successful**:
- *Objective:* This data point can be used for creating a rule that will check if the policy evaluation is successful in pipelines. (This data point is applicable to both CI and CD Pipelines)

![](./static/p-harness.png)

3. **Tests passing on CI (boolean)**:
- *Objective:* This data point can be used for creating a rule that will check if all the test cases running the CI Pipeline are passing(not a single failing test case). (This data point is only applicable to CI Pipeline)

![](./static/t-harness.png)

4. **STO stage added in pipeline**:
- *Objective:* This data point can be used for creating a rule that will check if STO stage is added in the pipelines. (This data point is applicable to both CI and CD Pipelines)

![](./static/sto-harness.png)

:::info

**Points to remember**:- 

- In the case of CI Pipeline, the first pipeline that we provide in the annotation in catalog info YAML will be used for evaluating the rules corresponding to data points.
If the rule depends on the execution of the pipeline then the latest execution of the provided CI Pipeline will be considered.

- In the case of CD Pipeline, the latest deployment pipeline using the first service that we provide in the annotation in catalog info YAML is considered for evaluating the rules corresponding to data points.

- If the data point depends on both CI and CD Pipelines, annotations corresponding to both should be present in the catalog YAML

:::

### Error Scenarios:

1. In case the check fails, the failure summary will provide the details for the pipeline because of which the check is failing. [We can refer to the pipeline and fix the pipeline with respect to the corresponding check]

![](./static/es1-harness.png)

2. In case if annotation is missing the catalog info YAML, we will get the failure summary for the check in order to add the annotation [We can refer to the Pre-Requisite section to add it]

![](./static/es2-harness.png)

## Catalog 

The following **Data Points** are available for Catalog Data Source. 

1. **Evaluate expression (JEXL):**
- *Objective:* Evaluate [JEXL expression](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-jexl/reference/syntax.html) on the catalog YAML file.
- *Calculation Method:* The catalog YAML is inspected to perform custom JEXL expression and returns the evaluated data.

#### Example Usage: 

Below is an example of `catalog-info.yaml` 

```YAML
##Example
apiVersion: backstage.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: artist-web
  description: The place to be, for great artists
  labels:
    example.com/custom: custom_label_value
  annotations:
    example.com/service-discovery: artistweb
    circleci.com/project-slug: github/example-org/artist-website
  tags:
    - java
  links:
    - url: https://admin.example-org.com
      title: Admin Dashboard
      icon: dashboard
      type: admin-dashboard
spec:
  type: website
  lifecycle: production
  owner: artist-relations-team
  system: public-websites
```

In the above example using the **Evaluate expression** we can match input values for all the root fields `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata`, and `spec` only and the [supported values](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/descriptor-format#contents) under the root field. 

for eg. `<+metadata.name>` would point to `artist-db` from the above example, and could be used to check the values 
 
:::info

We only support string and key-value pair data types in JEXL, some datatype like array, list aren't supported.

:::

    ...
```

## Kubernetes

:::info

The Kubernetes datasource being dependant on the Kubernetes Plugin for annotations and proxy we only support `label-selector` eg. `'backstage.io/kubernetes-label-selector': 'app=my-app,component=front-end'` rest all other annotation type mentioned [here](https://backstage.io/docs/features/kubernetes/configuration#common-backstageiokubernetes-id-label) are planned to be supported in the next few releases. 

Also for additional filtering we support namespace in annotation `'backstage.io/kubernetes-namespace': dice-space` as well, but `label-selector` is mandatory. 

:::

### Prerequisites:

1. **Plugin Configuration**

- The Kubernetes plugin needs to be configured. Refer [here](https://developer.harness.io/docs/internal-developer-portal/plugins/available-plugins/kubernetes).

:::info

The plugin provides 2 ways to authenticate - `serviceAccount` and `Google authentication`. But currently, the scorecards supports `serviceAccount` type authentication only.

:::

2. **Entity Configuration**

- There are two ways to surface Kubernetes components as part of an entity using annotations - `backstage.io/kubernetes-id` and `backstage.io/kubernetes-label-selector`. But currently, scorecards support [backstage.io/kubernetes-label-selector](https://backstage.io/docs/features/kubernetes/configuration/#label-selector-query-annotation) annotation only. 

The following **Data Points** are available for Kubernetes Data Source.

1. **Replicas Count**:

- *Objective:* Fetches the number of replicas configured for the given service.
- *Calculation Method:* The label selector configured in the catalog YAML is used to identify the Kubernetes workload and the configured replica count is used. The cluster details configured in the Kubernetes plugin are used. If more than one cluster is configured, the workload search is done in each cluster and a minimum of all the replica counts is taken into consideration.
- *Prerequisites:* The Kubernetes plugin needs to be configured and enabled in the admin section. Refer [here](https://developer.harness.io/docs/internal-developer-portal/plugins/available-plugins/kubernetes) for more details. 

![](./static/replica-k8s.png)

2. **Days passed since the application was last deployed**:

- *Objective:* Fetches the number of days since the most recent deployment was done.
- *Calculation Method:* The label selector configured in the catalog YAML is used to identify the `Kubernetes workload` and the `lastUpdateTime` is used from the conditions section. The cluster details configured in the Kubernetes plugin are used. If more than one cluster is configured, the workload search is done in each cluster and the oldest deployment time of all is taken into consideration.
- *Prerequisites:* The Kubernetes plugin needs to be configured and enabled in the admin section. Refer [here](https://developer.harness.io/docs/internal-developer-portal/plugins/available-plugins/kubernetes) for more details.

## PagerDuty

### Prerequisites:

- The PagerDuty plugin must be configured and enabled in the admin section. Refer [here](https://developer.harness.io/docs/internal-developer-portal/plugins/available-plugins/pagerduty/).


The following **Data Points** are available for PagerDuty Data Source.

1. **Is on-call Set** - This data point can be used for creating rules that will check if the on-call is set for a given service.

5. Now add a `tag` under which category your check belongs to , Ex. "Developer Productivity", "Software Maturity" and click `enter` to add each tags. 

6. Now add the default result in case of missing data and **Save Changes**. Your checks will be added. 

## Checks Overview

- Once the Checks are created, you can view the list of all the checks under the **Checks** tab.

- To have an overview of a single check and information on all the components it is applied, select the tab under **Check Stats** column for an individual check, it will redirect you to the overview page. 

- The overview page lists all the components on which the check is applied and the graph helps you to track time-sensitive information on the components on which the check has passed, this can be used to track functions like migration and upgrades across your software ecosystem.
