:::info Harness IDP SMP Edition [BETA]
Harness IDP Self-Managed Platform (SMP) Edition is currently in **BETA**. Please refer to the [Harness IDP Release Notes](/release-notes/internal-developer-portal) to keep track of new feature updates and improvements.
:::

## Harness IDP SMP Edition
[Harness Self-Managed Enterprise Edition](https://developer.harness.io/docs/self-managed-enterprise-edition/smp-overview) is an on-premises solution that allows you to install and run Harness on your own infrastructure. It gives you full control over data, security, and compliance while leveraging Harness’s software delivery capabilities. **Harness IDP** is available for the **Self-Managed Enterprise Edition**. This means you can use Harness IDP with the SMP version on your own infrastructure.

:::info Only for IDP 2.0
Harness IDP on SMP is available only for **IDP 2.0**. **IDP 1.0** is **not supported** on SMP.

### Architecture 

![](./static/smp-release-1.png)

#### PostgreSQL Databases created by IDP

IDP creates multiple **per-plugin databases** in PostgreSQL. Each database name is **prefixed with your Harness account ID**.

**Typical Databases**

* `accountId_app`
* `accountId_auth`
* `accountId_catalog`
* `accountId_devtools`
* `accountId_layout`
* `accountId_permission`
* `accountId_proxy`
* `accountId_scaffolder`
* `accountId_search`
* `accountId_sonarqube`
* `accountId_techdocs`

> **Note:** The exact set can vary based on which plugins are enabled. Some plugins may create their **own additional databases**.

#### PostgreSQL Configuration
- If `postgresql.enabled` is `true` in your setup, IDP will reuse the **in-cluster PostgreSQL instance** and default chart credentials will be used automatically.
- If `postgresql.enabled` is `false`, provide external PostgreSQL credentials in the following format:
```
postgres:
  ## - protocol to use for connection
  protocol: ''
  ## - host array for external
  hosts: []
  extraArgs: ''
  secrets:
    kubernetesSecrets:
      - secretName: ''
        keys:
          POSTGRES_USER: ''
          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ''
    secretManagement:
      externalSecretsOperator:
        - secretStore:
            name: ''
            kind: ''
          remoteKeys:
            POSTGRES_USER:
              name: ''
              property: ''
            POSTGRES_PASSWORD:
              name: ''
              property: ''
```

## Supported Infrastructure
The Self-Managed Enterprise Edition runs within the customer’s environment alongside existing services. You must have a Kubernetes cluster with a configured load balancer. Harness IDP is supported on SMP only when the control plane is deployed on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** using **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)**. Deployments on AWS (EKS), Azure (AKS), on-prem, or OpenShift are **not supported**.

:::warning Network/Firewall Requirement
If your setup integrates with third-party SaaS products (for example, PagerDuty, GitHub, or GitLab), you must whitelist their domains in your firewall policies.

**PagerDuty example**
- **FQDNs:** `harness.pagerduty.com`
- **Protocol/Ports:** `tcp:80`, `tcp:443`
