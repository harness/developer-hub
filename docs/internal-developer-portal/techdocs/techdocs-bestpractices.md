## Introduction

TechDocs is IDPâ€™s documentation site generator, leveraging MkDocs to convert Markdown files into a static site adhering to the concepts of [docs-like-code](https://www.docslikecode.com/). This guide highlights best practices for creating and maintaining documentation in TechDocs, including generating one-page and multi-page sites, using MkDocs plugins, embedding videos, and creating architecture diagrams. 

## Creating a One-Page Docs Site

One-page documentation is ideal for quick-start guides, FAQs, or any standalone documentation.

### Steps:
1. **Set Up the Directory:**

- Create a repository with a single index.md file in the root directory.

```sh
/docs
  |-- index.md
```

2. **Basic `mkdocs.yml` Configuration:**

- Configure MkDocs to use index.md as the sole content file.

```YAML
site_name: Your Site Name
nav:
  - Home: index.md
```

3. **Publishing:**

Push your documentation to the Git repository and [add it to your `catalog-info.yaml` as annotation](/docs/internal-developer-portal/techdocs/enable-docs) to serve it in IDP. If needed, run `techdocs-cli` locally for testing:

```bash
techdocs-cli serve
```

## Working with Multi-Page Sites

For projects requiring detailed documentation, multi-page sites are recommended. These sites can have hierarchical navigation and allow for better content organization.

### Auto-Generated Navigation:

MkDocs generates navigation based on folder and file structures

- Example Structure: 

```sh
/docs
  |-- index.md
  |-- guide/
       |-- getting-started.md
       |-- troubleshooting.md
  |-- reference/
       |-- api.md
```

- Resulting NAV

    - Home
    - Guide
        - Getting Started
        - Troubleshooting
    - Reference
    - API

### Manual Navigation Control:

For custom navigation, explicitly define the structure in `mkdocs.yml`:

```YAML
site_name: Project Documentation
nav:
  - Home: index.md
  - Guide:
      - Getting Started: guide/getting-started.md
      - Troubleshooting: guide/troubleshooting.md
  - Reference:
      - API: reference/api.md
```

Here's an [example mkdocs.yml](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/mkdocs.yml) following the above structure.

## Enhancing Docs with Architecture Diagrams

Visual representations, such as architecture diagrams, improve documentation clarity. Use the installed MkDocs plugins for diagrams.

### 1. Using Mermaid for Diagrams

Mermaid diagrams are supported out of the box.

#### Prerequisites to use in local environment:
- Ensure the `mkdocs-mermaid2-plugin` is installed and configured in your `mkdocs.yml`.   

```YAML
plugins:
    - mermaid2
```

```sh
### System Architecture Diagram

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Client] -->|Requests| B[Backend API];
    B -->|Responses| C[Database];
    C -->|Data| B;
```

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Client] -->|Requests| B[Backend API];
    B -->|Responses| C[Database];
    C -->|Data| B;
```

#### Supported Diagram Types:
- Flowcharts
- Sequence Diagrams
- Gantt Charts
- Pie Charts

For more syntax options, refer to the [Mermaid documentation](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/).

### 2. Using **PlantUML** for Advanced Diagrams

PlantUML is ideal for more detailed and customizable diagrams, such as class diagrams, activity diagrams, and deployment diagrams.

#### Prerequisites to use in local environemnt:
- Install and configure the `mkdocs-plantuml-plugin` in your project.

#### Adding PlantUML to `mkdocs.yml`:

```yaml
plugins:
  - plantuml:
      server: https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml
```

#### Example Usage:
- In your Markdown file:

```sh
### Deployment Diagram

```plantuml
@startuml
actor User
participant "Frontend" as FE
participant "Backend" as BE
database "Database" as DB

User -> FE : Request
FE -> BE : Process Request
BE -> DB : Query Data
DB --> BE : Return Data
BE --> FE : Response
FE --> User : Render Data
@enduml
```

## Embedding Videos in TechDocs

Embedding videos enriches documentation, especially for tutorials or product demonstrations.

### Embedding Syntax:
Use Markdown for embedding videos:

```markdown
<video controls>
  <source src="https://www.example.com/path-to-video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
```

### Allowed Domains:
To maintain security and compatibility, only embed videos from the following domains are allowed:

- youtube.com
- www.youtube.com
- youtu.be
- www.youtu.be
- drive.google.com
- zoom.us
- loom.com
- sharepoint.com
- dropbox.com
- docs.google.com

## Create download links for static assets

You may want to make files available for download by your users such as PDF documents, images, or code templates. Download links for files included in your docs directory can be made by adding `{: download }` after a Markdown link.

```sh
[Link text](https://example.com/foo.jpg){: download }
```
The user's browser will download the file as `download.jpg` when the link is clicked.

Specify a file name to control the name the file will be given when it is downloaded:

```sh
[Link text](https://example.com/foo.jpg){: download="foo.jpg" }
```

## How to add the documentation setup to your Workflows

The purpose of this how-to guide is to walk you through how to add the required configuration and some default markdown files to your new Workflows. You can use the [react-ssr-workflow](https://github.com/backstage/software-templates/tree/main/scaffolder-templates/react-ssr-template) as a reference when walking through the steps.

Prerequisites:

- An existing software template including a template.yaml together with a skeleton folder including at least a catalog-info.yaml.

1. Update your component's entity description by adding the following lines to the catalog-info.yaml in your skeleton folder.

```sh
annotations:
  backstage.io/techdocs-ref: dir:.
```
The `backstage.io/techdocs-ref` annotation is used by TechDocs to download the documentation source files for generating an entity's TechDocs site.

2. Create a `mkdocs.yml` file in the root of your skeleton folder with the following content:

```sh
site_name: ${{values.component_id}}
site_description: ${{values.description}}

nav:
  - Introduction: index.md

plugins:
  - techdocs-core
```

3. Create a `/docs` folder in the skeleton folder with at least a `index.md` file in it.

The `docs/index.md` can for example have the following content:

```sh
# ${{ values.component_id }}

${{ values.description }}

## Getting started

Start writing your documentation by adding more markdown (.md) files to this
folder (/docs) or replace the content in this file.
```

:::info
The values of `site_name`, `component_id` and `site_description` depends on how you have configured your Workflow definition YAML.
:::

Done! You now have support for TechDocs in your own Workflows!
