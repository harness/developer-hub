This is a list of on-hold plugins, that were previously enabled and available in Harness IDP, but now has been disabled and are unavailable due to issues found in them. The team would work on enabling them back in IDP only on customer/user requests.

1. TODO: This plugin has memory leak issues. <!-- removed broken link - Target page doesn't exist. -->
2. [GitLab](https://github.com/immobiliare/backstage-plugin-gitlab): This plugin caused the servers to crash and had authentication requests on going even when it was disabled.
