## Configuration

### Application configuration YAML

This plugin requires a backend proxy configuration to make calls to Jira with authentication. In the following configuration, replace `<your-jira-url>` with the Jira instance project (for example https://mycompany.atlassian.net):

```yaml
proxy:
  endpoints:
    /jira/api:
      target: "<your-jira-url>"
      headers:
        Authorization: Basic ${JIRA_TOKEN}
        Accept: application/json
        Content-Type: application/json
        X-Atlassian-Token: nocheck
        User-Agent: Harness-IDP
      pathRewrite:
        api/proxy/jira/api/?: /
```

### Secrets

Since the `JIRA_TOKEN` variable is used in the application configuration, you must generate a Jira API key and set it as the value of `JIRA_TOKEN`. For information about how to generate a Jira API key, go to the [instructions](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens).

- Select **Create API token**, give some label and copy the generated token
- **Base64 encode API token**: We need to prefix the token with the Jira user email and base64 encode it.
```sh
echo -n "jira-mail@example.com:hTBgqVcrcxRYpT5TCzTA9C0F" | base64
```

:::info

**base64** encoding is mandatory for the API Token and you need to add your `email address` followed by `:` as a prefix to the token generated e.g.: `jira-mail@example.com:hTBgqVcrcxRYpT5TCzTA9C0F`

:::

- **Create secret in Harness to store API token**: Once token is generated, click on the “input field” next to `JIRA_TOKEN` and you will see a pop-up to create or chose existing secret

- To create new secret, click on **New Secret Text** and enter values like below. Make sure you save Secret Value with “Basic” as prefix. 


:::info
Example of the secret to be added: `Basic xxxxYYYYYYXXXxxxxxxxYxx==`
:::

- After selecting the new secret, click on **Save Configurations** and then followed by **Enable Plugin** button. This will take few seconds to reflect the changes in the components.

### Delegate proxy

_No action required_

This plugin does not require a delegate proxy to be set up because Jira is publicly accessible.

## Layout

This plugin exports several UI cards that you can show on the **Overview** tab of a service or any other layout page. Go to **Admin** > **Layout**, select **Service** in the dropdown menu, and then add the following in the **Overview** section:

#### EntityJiraOverviewCard

For displaying a general overview of Jira issues:

```yaml
- component: EntityJiraOverviewCard
```

#### EntityJiraActivityStreamCard

For viewing the activity stream particularly:

```yaml
- component: EntityJiraActivityStreamCard
```

#### EntityJiraQueryCard

For displaying issues based on a specific JQL query:

```yaml
- component: EntityJiraQueryCard
```

This component uses the `jira/all-issues-jql` annotation from the entity's metadata (see Annotations section below). You don't need to provide JQL in the component configuration.

The JQL query is specified in the entity's annotations.

### Conditional Display

You can make these cards appear conditionally based on whether the required annotations are present. Each card type has its own condition:

**For EntityJiraOverviewCard:**
```yaml
- component: EntitySwitch
  specs:
    cases:
      - if: isJiraAvailable
        content:
          component: EntityJiraOverviewCard
```

**For EntityJiraQueryCard:**
```yaml
- component: EntitySwitch
  specs:
    cases:
      - if: hasJiraQuery
        content:
          component: EntityJiraQueryCard
```

**For EntityJiraActivityStreamCard:**
```yaml
- component: EntitySwitch
  specs:
    cases:
      - if: isJiraAvailable
        content:
          component: EntityJiraActivityStreamCard
```

This ensures that the components only appear when the necessary Jira data is available for that entity.

## Annotations

To configure the plugin for a service in the software catalog, set one or more of the following annotations in its `catalog-info.yaml` definition file:

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    jira/project-key: <example-jira-project-key>
    jira/component: <example-component> # optional, you might skip this value to fetch data for all components
    jira/label: tech-debt # optional, for filtering issues by label
    jira/all-issues-jql: project = "IDP" AND assignee = currentUser() AND status IN ("In Progess", "In Progress") ORDER BY created DESC # for specifying JQL queries used by EntityJiraQueryCard
```

## Support

The plugin is owned by [Roadie](https://roadie.io) and managed in the [Roadie plugins repository](https://github.com/roadieHQ/roadie-backstage-plugins) as an open-source project. Create a GitHub issue to report bugs or suggest new features for the plugin.
