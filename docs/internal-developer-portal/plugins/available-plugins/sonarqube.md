## Configuration

### Application configuration YAML

- Under the **Plugins** tab in **Admin**, go to `app-config.yaml` and **Edit YAML** to configure your SonarQube instance in the **target** field.

### Secrets

- Go to SonarQube, "eg: `https://sonar.your-comapny-name.io/account/security`", for generating a new token, **Enter Token Name** and choose **User Token** in **Select Token Type**. 

:::info

Ensure that the user creating the token has the necessary permissions to access the specified instance and project mentioned in the [annotations](/docs/internal-developer-portal/plugins/available-plugins/sonarqube#annotations). Additional troubleshooting information can be found [here](/docs/internal-developer-portal/plugins/available-plugins/sonarqube#troubleshooting).

- **Create secret in Harness** to store API token, click on “New Secret Text” and enter values as shown below.

### Delegate proxy

- If SonarQube is deployed on-prem, `sonar.mycompany.com` will not be accessible from outside, so a delegate proxy has to be selected. Please ensure you have [Harness Delegate installed](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/delegates/install-delegates/overview) for the same.

## Layout

This plugin exports a UI card that you can show on the **Overview** tab of a service or any other layout page.  The following configuration is set by default in **Layout** under **Admin** for **Service** and you do not need to change anything:

```yaml
- component: EntitySonarQubeCard
          specs:
            gridProps:
              md: 6
```

## Annotations

To configure the plugin for a service in the software catalog, set one of the following annotations in its `catalog-info.yaml` definition file.

The following configuration is recommended:

```YAML
metadata:
  annotations:
    sonarqube.org/project-key: <instance-name>/<project-key>
```
The `instance-name` is optional if there is only one SonarQube instance, as the default instance from the plugin configuration will be used.

## Troubleshooting

### 401 Unauthorized 

- Check for the validity of the user token added as secrets.
- Ensure that the user token you have used has access permission to the instance mentioned in the annotation.

### There is no SonarQube project with key 

- We need to use the `project_id`, **not** the project name. The `project_id` can be found in the URL, where it appears as `?id=project-id`

- The SonarQube token configured in the Harness secret **must be Base64 encoded**. Using a raw, non-encoded token will result in authentication failures or missing project data when using the SonarQube plugin.

  To encode your token, use the following command:

  ```bash
  echo -n 'your-raw-token-here' | base64
  ```

- Ensure that the user token you have used has the permission to view the project mentioned in the annotation.
- The `sonarqube.org/project-key` annotation is of the correct format `<instance-name>/<project-key>`. 

## Support

The plugin is owned by SDA SE and managed in the [Backstage repository](https://github.com/backstage/community-plugins/tree/main/workspaces/sonarqube/plugins) as an open-source project. Create a GitHub issue to report bugs or suggest new features for the plugin.
