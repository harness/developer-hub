## Configuration

### Application configuration YAML

_No action required_

This plugin requires a backend proxy configuration to make calls to Harness APIs with authentication. The following configuration is set by default and you do not need to change anything:

```yaml
proxy:
  "/harness/prod":
    target: "https://app.harness.io/"
    pathRewrite:
      "/api/proxy/harness/prod/?": "/"
    allowedHeaders:
      - authorization
```

### Secrets

No secrets are required for this plugin because both IDP and Feature Flags are part of the Harness software delivery platform.

### Delegate proxy

_No action required_

This plugin does not require a delegate proxy to be set up.

## Layout

_No action required_

This plugin exports a UI tab that you can use as a new Feature Flags tab for a service or for any other layout page. The following configuration is set by default in **Layout** under **Admin** for **Service** and you do not need to change anything:

```yaml
- name: feature-flags
  path: /feature-flags
  title: Feature Flags
  contents:
    - component: EntityHarnessFeatureFlagContent
```

Also you could add a conditional like `isHarnessFeatureFlagAvailable` which is met when the `harness.io/project-url` annotation is present in the software components's `catalog-info.yaml` definition file.

```yaml
- name: feature-flags
  path: /feature-flags
  title: Feature Flags
  contents:
    - component: EntitySwitch
      specs:
        cases:
          - if: isHarnessFeatureFlagAvailable
            content:
              component: EntityHarnessFeatureFlagContent
```

  annotations:
    # mandatory annotation
    harness.io/project-url: <harness_project_url>
