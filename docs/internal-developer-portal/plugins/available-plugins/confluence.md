## Configuration

### Application configuration YAML

This plugin requires a backend configuration to make calls to Confluence with authentication. In the following configuration, replace `<your-org-name>` with the Confluence instance project (for example https://mycompany.atlassian.net). 

Replace `<list-of-spaces>` with a comma-separated list of the Confluence spaces that you want to include in the search. Enclose the list in brackets, as follows: `spaces: [ENG, IT, OPS]`. For the spaces you specify, indexing occurs every 12 hours. If the list is empty, the plugin does not index spaces. 

Replace  `<your-username>` with the user name which is essentially the email (for example alice@mycompany.com). 

```yaml
confluence:
  wikiUrl: https://<your-org-name>.atlassian.net/wiki
  spaces: [<list-of-spaces>]
  auth:
    username: <your-username>
    password: ${CONFLUENCE_TOKEN}
```

### Secrets

Since the `CONFLUENCE_TOKEN` variable is used in the application configuration, you must generate a Confluence API key and set it as the value of `CONFLUENCE_TOKEN`. For information about how to generate an API key, go to the [instructions](https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-account/docs/manage-api-tokens-for-your-atlassian-account/).

### Delegate proxy

If your Confluence website is self-hosted or has an IP address allowlist, include the base URL `mycompany.atlassian.net` in the delegate proxy section. If your Confluence instance is hosted on a public cloud and can be accessed directly using a token, skip this section.
After adding the host, you can select one or more delegates that have access to the host.

:::note

When adding the host, include only the host name. Remove the protocol (HTTP/HTTPS) associated with it.
