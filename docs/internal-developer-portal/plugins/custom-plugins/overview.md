The Custom Plugins feature in IDP will allow users to plug their own private Backstage plugins into the Harness IDP and use them along with the curated plugins available for everyone. The development and ownership of these plugins is dependent on the users.

At present we only support the **Frontend Plugins**

## How Do We Do It

In Harness IDP we allow two ways in which you can add your custom plugins

1. The npm package URL for **public npm packages** of the plugin (eg. `https://www.npmjs.com/package/@parsifal-m/plugin-dev-quotes-homepage`)
2. The tar.gz folder
