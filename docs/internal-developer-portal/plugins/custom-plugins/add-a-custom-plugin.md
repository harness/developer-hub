## Add/Upload a New Plugin

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="NPM Library">

4. Now add the URL for your plugin **public** npm package.

eg,. `https://www.npmjs.com/package/@parsifal-m/plugin-dev-quotes-homepage`, `https://www.npmjs.com/package/backstage-plugin-should-i-deploy`

![](./static/use-url.png)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Upload Zip file">

4. You can as well pack your backstage frontend plugins using **[yarn pack](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/pack/#toc-yarn-pack)** and upload the resulting `package.tgz` file

:::warning

Only files packaged using `yarn pack` is to be used while uploading the zip file.

<summary>How to create and pack your front end Plugin</summary>
    
1. Install backstage following this [documentation](https://backstage.io/docs/getting-started/#create-your-backstage-app) 
2. Give your app a name.
3. Now `cd <your-app-name>`.
4. Now create a scaffolder for frontend plugin using `yarn new --select plugin`
5. You now have a plugin with the following folder structure.

```sh
new-plugin/
    dev/
        index.ts
    node_modules/
    src/
        components/
            ExampleComponent/
                ExampleComponent.test.tsx
                ExampleComponent.tsx
                index.ts
            ExampleFetchComponent/
                ExampleFetchComponent.test.tsx
                ExampleFetchComponent.tsx
                index.ts
        index.ts
        plugin.test.ts
        plugin.ts
        routes.ts
        setupTests.ts
    .eslintrc.js
    package.json
    README.md
```

6. Follow the steps mentioned [here](https://backstage.io/docs/plugins/plugin-development) to build on top of it. 
7. Once you have the plugin ready, run `yarn tsc` at the root of the backstage app.
8. **Now cd into your plugin directory and run `yarn build` followed by `yarn pack`. You'll have a `package.tgz` file generated, this file could be used to upload your plugin into IDP.** 

Make sure you have the `dist` folder generated after you do `yarn pack` without that the package can't be read by IDP when uploaded. The `yarn pack` command looks something like this.

```sh
dev % yarn build
dev % yarn pack 
➤ YN0036: Calling the "prepack" lifecycle script
➤ YN0000: LICENSE
➤ YN0000: README.md
➤ YN0000: dist/index.d.ts
➤ YN0000: dist/index.esm.js
➤ YN0000: dist/index.esm.js.map
➤ YN0000: package.json
➤ YN0036: Calling the "postpack" lifecycle script
➤ YN0000: Package archive generated in /Users/deba/Documents/backstage-dev-quotes/package.tgz
➤ YN0000: Done in 2s 341ms
```

Unzip the `package.tgz` and check for the **dist** folder before you try uploading it into Harness. The unzipped folder for the above given example plugin folder structure would look something like this:

```sh
new-plugin/
    dev/
        index.ts
    node_modules/
    dist/
        index.d.ts
        index.esm.js
        index.esm.js.map
    src/
        components/
            ExampleComponent/
                ExampleComponent.test.tsx
                ExampleComponent.tsx
                index.ts
            ExampleFetchComponent/
                ExampleFetchComponent.test.tsx
                ExampleFetchComponent.tsx
                index.ts
        index.ts
        plugin.test.ts
        plugin.ts
        routes.ts
        setupTests.ts
    .eslintrc.js
    package.json
    README.md
```

</details>

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

5. Now Click Next and start adding the **Plugin Metadata**. You have to fill the following fields 
    
    - **Plugin Name** : Add a name for your Plugin
    - **Package name** : This will be same as your plugin package present in your plugin's `package.json` file. Make sure the name is exactly similar to what's mentioned in the `package.json` including `@`, eg: `@parsifal-m/plugin-dev-quotes-homepage`
    - **Description** : Add an apt description for your plugin, especially the function of the plugin.
    - **Category** : Add an functional category for your plugin like `Monitoring`, `Observability`, `CI/CD` etc.
    - **Created By** : Add the [User Group](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/role-based-access-control/add-user-groups/#built-in-user-groups) you belong to from the dropdown.

## Layout

6. Now click next and Add **Layout** for your plugin. You have 3 categories in this and the layout is sourced from `packages/app/src/components/Catalog/EntityPage.tsx`. Below are the examples.

![](./static//layout.png)

- **Card**: Here's an [example](https://github.com/harness/backstage-plugins/blob/cd70f9c03ed52917d8f409c2ceb7b7fc874c97de/packages/app/src/components/catalog/EntityPage.tsx#L192) `EntityLinksCard` of Links card on **Overview** page.

![](./static/links-card.png)

- **Tab**: Here's an [example](https://github.com/harness/backstage-plugins/blob/cd70f9c03ed52917d8f409c2ceb7b7fc874c97de/packages/app/src/components/catalog/EntityPage.tsx#L87) `EntityHarnessCiCdContent` of Harness CI/CD tab. 

![](./static/ci-cd-tab.png)

- **Menu Item in SideNav**: Here's an example of TODO plugin in side nav. 
![](./static/to-do-plugin.png)

- **Conditional**: Here's an [example](https://github.com/harness/backstage-plugins/blob/cd70f9c03ed52917d8f409c2ceb7b7fc874c97de/packages/app/src/components/catalog/EntityPage.tsx#L86C33-L86C33) of the Harness CI/CD plugin, also conditional is required if you want to check for the annotations in `catalog-info.yaml` in case of absence of adequate annotation required the plugin won't show up for the particular software component. 

## Configurations

7. Now Click Next and go to the Configurations Page by default configuration is disabled.

8. If your plugin doesn't require any configuration settings like **Proxy** or authentication for **API** you can go ahead and enable the plugin directly. 

9. If you require `app-config.yaml` for your plugin, then **enable configuration**. 

10. Now add the proxy part here, as given below in the example,

```YAML
proxy:
    endpoints: 
        /mynewplugin:
        target: https://somerandomapi.com/api/v2
        pathRewrite:
            /api/proxy/mynewplugin/?: /
        headers:
            Authorization: "Api-Token ${SECRET_TOKEN}"
```

11. Now in the above proxy authorization is added as a variable `SECRET_TOKEN` and the secret is stored in Harness Secret manager. 

![](./static/secret-as-variable.png)

![](./static/new-secret.png)

12. You can as well access any private URLs/PORT if required by your plugin and that is behind any firewalls using [Harness Delegate](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/delegates/delegate-concepts/delegate-overview/#install-a-delegate).

![](./static/delegate.png)

13. Now Enable the Plugin.

:::info

Once you enable the PLugin it will approximately take around 30 minutes for the plugin to be enabled as we rebuild the IDP image with your plugin. 

:::

14. Once the plugin is Enabled, to add it in your sidenav as shown in the image go to the **Layout** under **Admin**.

![](./static/to-do-plugin.png)

15. For **card based plugin** update for **Service** under the `overview` and add the `components` for the custom plugin under `contents` as shown below.

```YAML
page:
  name: EntityLayout
  tabs:
    - name: Overview
      path: /
      title: Overview
      contents:
        - component: EntityOrphanWarning
        - component: EntityProcessingErrorsPanel
        - component: EntityAboutCard
          specs:
            props:
              variant: gridItem
            gridProps:
              md: 6
```
- For **tab** based plugin you can update the `component` name under **Service** or any other pages. 

- For **Full Page Plugin** Under the **Sidenav** configuration, add the plugin name as a `SidebarItem` with reference to your plugin `to: component name` under `props`. Read more about [Configuring Layout of IDP Catalog pages](Configuring Layout of IDP Catalog pages).
