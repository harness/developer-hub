You could filter the plugins according to Owners and Categories as well as search a plugin by its name. 

### Request Access for Plugin

In the "Explore Plugins" view, you can upvote a plugin to be added to Harness IDP. This allows the users to upvote a plugin and help the Harness IDP team prioritize customer requests. The team will review the plugin, scan it for security vulnerabilities, and, if approved, add it to the IDP. It generally takes 4-8 weeks for a new plugin to be available in the marketplace to use.
