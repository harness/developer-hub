You could filter the plugins according to Owners and Categories as well as search a plugin by its name. 

### Request Access for Plugin

In the "Explore Plugins" view, you can request a plugin to be added to Harness IDP. The team will review the plugin, scan it for security vulnerabilities, and, if approved, add it to the IDP. It generally takes 4-8 weeks for a new plugin to be available in the marketplace to use.
