# Change Management

:::danger Not Yet Available
Change management features in Harness AI SRE will be available in Q2. This documentation is for preview purposes only.
:::

## Overview

Harness AI SRE provides a unified view of system changes across your Harness ecosystem. By integrating directly with Harness deployments, feature flags, and other change events, teams can quickly identify, correlate, and investigate changes without needing to create formal alerts or incidents.

## Key Features

### Unified Change Visibility
- Comprehensive view of Harness deployments
- Feature flag changes and rollouts
- Service configuration updates
- Infrastructure modifications
- Change approval tracking

### Change Investigation
- Investigate issues without creating formal alerts
- Correlate user-reported problems with system changes
- Review change history across services
- Track change impact and blast radius
- Identify potential risk factors

### Change Correlation
- Automatic correlation of related changes
- Pattern detection across change types
- Anomaly identification in change patterns
- Timeline-based change visualization
- Cross-service change impact analysis

### Risk Management
- Pre-deployment change risk assessment
- Change approval workflows
- Impact analysis for proposed changes
- Rollback planning and execution
- Change blackout period management

### Integration with Harness Platform
- Direct integration with Harness CD deployments
- Feature flag state tracking
- Service configuration monitoring
- Infrastructure change detection
- Cross-platform change correlation

## Use Cases

### Proactive Investigation
- Investigate user-reported issues without formal alerts
- Review recent changes when symptoms are reported
- Correlate reported problems with system changes
- Quick access to change context and history

### Change Risk Management
- Review changes for potential risks
- Make informed approval decisions
- Plan and coordinate complex changes
- Manage upstream and downstream impacts

### Pattern Analysis
- Identify recurring change patterns
- Detect anomalous change behavior
- Track change frequency and impact
- Monitor change success rates

### Change Communication
- Notify upstream dependencies of changes
- Coordinate changes across teams
- Track change acknowledgments
- Manage change communication workflows

## Benefits

- **Reduced MTTR**: Quickly identify change-related issues
- **Proactive Risk Management**: Assess changes before incidents occur
- **Better Visibility**: Single view of all system changes
- **Improved Coordination**: Streamline change communication
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify problematic change patterns
- **Incident Prevention**: Address issues before they escalate

## Next Steps

Once change management becomes available in Q2, you'll be able to:
- View comprehensive change history
- Track Harness deployments and feature flags
- Investigate changes without creating incidents
- Manage change approvals and risk
- Coordinate changes across teams
- Set up change notifications
