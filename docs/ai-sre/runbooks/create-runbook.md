# Create a Runbook

Runbooks in Harness AI SRE enable you to automate incident response workflows, operational procedures, and remediation actions. This comprehensive guide walks you through creating, configuring, and deploying effective runbooks that can significantly reduce mean time to resolution (MTTR) and improve your team's operational efficiency.

## Before You Begin

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following before creating your first runbook:

- **Platform Access**: Active Harness AI SRE account with appropriate permissions.
- **User Permissions**: Required Account, Organisation and Project level permissions.
- **Integration Access**: Configured integrations for the tools you plan to use (Slack, Jira, ServiceNow, etc.).
- **Monitoring Setup**: Alert sources configured (Datadog, New Relic, PagerDuty, etc.).

### Key Concepts
Before diving into runbook creation, familiarize yourself with these core concepts:

- **Actions**: Individual tasks or operations within a runbook (notifications, API calls, pipeline executions).
- **Triggers**: Conditions that automatically initiate runbook execution.
- **Variables**: Dynamic values that can be passed between actions and customized per execution.
- **Sequences**: The order in which actions are executed within your workflow.

## Step 1: Initialize Your Runbook

### Create a New Runbook
1. **Navigate to Runbooks**: Go to **AI SRE** â†’ **Runbooks** in your Harness platform
2. **Start Creation**: Click **+ New Runbook** to begin the creation process
3. **Basic Information**: Provide essential details for your runbook:
   - **Name**: Use a descriptive name (e.g., "High CPU Alert Response", "Database Connection Recovery").
   - **Description**: Clearly explain the runbook's purpose and when it should be used.

### Design Your Workflow
Once your runbook is created, you'll enter the workflow designer where you can build your automation sequence.

#### 1. Add Actions to Your Workflow
Actions are the building blocks of your runbook. Each action performs a specific task in your incident response or operational workflow.

**Common Action Types:**
- **Communication**: Send notifications, create Slack channels, start Zoom or Microsoft Teams meetings.
- **Harness**: Execute pipelines, run scripts, trigger deployments, or add a feature flag.
- **Ticketing**: Create Jira or ServiceNow incident tickets, update status, assign teams, or update incident tickets.
- **Change**: Manage GitHub pull requests, create or revert changes.
- **Custom**: Build your own actions using custom HTTP actions or custom scripts.

<DocImage path={require('./static/add-action.png')} width="90%" height="90%" title="Adding Actions to Runbook Workflow" />

#### 2. Configure Action Parameters
Each action requires specific configuration to function correctly. Parameters vary by action type but typically include:

**Example: Slack Channel Creation**
- **Channel Name**: Use variables like `${incident.id}` for dynamic naming.
- **Channel Privacy**: Configure privacy with public or private channels.

<DocImage path={require('./static/configure-parameters.png')} width="90%" height="90%" title="Configuring Action Parameters" />

#### 3. Arrange Action Sequences
The order of actions is crucial for effective runbook execution. Drag and drop actions in the left panel according to the order of execution to create logical sequences.

<DocImage path={require('./static/action-sequences.png')} width="90%" height="90%" title="Configuring Action Execution Sequences" />

**Best Practices for Sequencing:**
- **Immediate Response**: Start with critical notifications and incident creation.
- **Information Gathering**: Follow with diagnostic and monitoring actions.
- **Remediation**: Execute fix actions based on gathered information.
- **Validation**: Verify that remediation was successful.
- **Closure**: Update stakeholders and close incidents.

#### 4. Define Workflow Variables
Variables make your runbooks dynamic and reusable across different scenarios.

#### Variable Configuration Steps
1. **Select Context Type**: Choose the Incident or Alert Context (Any/No/Custom) based on which you want to define the variables.
2. **Choose Specific Type**: For Custom Incident or Alert Context, select the appropriate Incident or Alert Type from the dropdown depending on the use case.

<DocImage path={require('./static/custom-incident-type.png')} width="90%" height="90%" title="Defining Custom Incident Type" />

<DocImage path={require('./static/custom-alert-type.png')} width="90%" height="90%" title="Defining Custom Alert Type" />

#### Variable Types
- **Input Variables**: Values provided when the runbook is triggered.
- **Output Variables**: Results from action executions.

#### Variable Configuration Details
- **Input Variables**: Must be defined based on the incident or alert context.
- **Output Variables**: Must be defined based on the action execution.
- **Required Fields**: Name, Display Name, Description, Type, and Default Value.
- **Data Types**: String, Integer, Number, Boolean, Object, or Array.
- **Requirement Level**: Variables can be defined as required or optional based on the use case.

<DocImage path={require('./static/workflow-variables.png')} width="90%" height="90%" title="Defining Workflow Variables" />

#### Dynamic Parameter Selection

When configuring actions, you can use dynamic parameters from various sources to make your runbooks more flexible and powerful.

1. **Select an Action**: After adding an action to your workflow, configure its parameters.
2. **Choose Dynamic Parameter Source**: For applicable fields, click the data picker icon to access dynamic data sources:
   - **Runbook Inputs**: Variables defined in the Input/Output section.
   - **Action Outputs**: Results from previously executed actions.
   - **Pipeline Outputs**: Data from Harness pipeline executions.
   - **Global Variables**: System-wide variables available to all runbooks.
   - **Key Events**: Event-driven data that can trigger specific behaviors.

<DocImage path={require('./static/dynamic-parameter-selection.png')} width="90%" height="90%" title="Selecting Dynamic Parameter Sources" />

#### Key Event Integration

Key Events provide a powerful way to create event-driven runbooks that respond to specific triggers.

1. **Select Key Event as Source**: When configuring an action parameter, choose "Key Event" as the data source.
2. **Create Input and Set Value**: Instead of navigating to the Input/Output section, you can create inputs directly:
   - Click "Create Input and Set Value".
   - Provide a Display Name, Type, and Default Value.
   - Save the new input variable.
   - Select the Key Event text from the input dropdown.

<DocImage path={require('./static/key-event-dynamic-input.png')} width="90%" height="90%" title="Key Event Dynamic Input" />

#### Trigger Configuration with Key Events

Once Key Events are configured in your action parameters:

1. **Set Trigger Condition**: In the Triggers section, set the condition to "Key Event Created".
2. **Map Event to Input**: The input field that was configured with the Key Event text can now be automatically populated when the trigger fires.
3. **Dynamic Execution**: When the specified Key Event occurs, the runbook will execute with the event data automatically mapped to your configured inputs.

<DocImage path={require('./static/key-event-trigger.png')} width="90%" height="90%" title="Configuring Key Event Triggers" />

This approach allows for seamless integration between event detection and automated response, without requiring manual configuration of input variables for each execution.
