# Configure Incident Templates

Learn how to create and manage incident templates in Harness AI SRE.

## Overview

Incident templates help you:
- Standardize incident handling
- Ensure consistent data collection
- Speed up incident creation
- Enable automation
- Support compliance

## Template Types

    severity: [severity]
    service: [service]
    environment: [environment]
    team: [team]
  timeline:
    - type: "detection"
      description: "Performance degradation detected in [service]"
    - type: "action"
      description: "Investigating root cause"
  communication:
    channel: "#[service]-incidents"
    initial_message: |
      üö® *New Incident: [service] Degradation*
      *Severity:* [severity]
      *Environment:* [environment]
      *Team:* [team]
      *Status:* Investigating
```

### Security Incident
```yaml
template:
  name: "Security Alert"
  fields:
    title: "[service] - Security Incident"

    - type: "action"
      description: "Security team notified"
  runbook:
    name: "Security Incident Response"
    variables:
      service: [service]
      environment: [environment]
  communication:
    channel: "#security-incidents"
    restricted: true
    initial_message: |
      üîí *Security Incident: [service]*

    team: "platform"
  timeline:
    - type: "detection"
      description: "Infrastructure issue detected in [service]"
    - type: "action"
      description: "Platform team investigating"
