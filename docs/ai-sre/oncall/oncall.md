- Eliminate context switching between separate tools
- Maintain consistent incident response workflows
- Automatic correlation between incidents and on-call assignments
- Direct integration with runbook automation

### Smart Scheduling
- Create and manage on-call schedules
- Define rotation patterns
- Set up holiday calendars
- Handle time zone management
- Support for follow-the-sun coverage
- Automatic schedule generation based on team availability

### Automated Escalations
- Define multi-level escalation policies
- Set up backup responders
- Configure response time expectations
- Automate escalation paths based on incident severity
- Dynamic escalation based on incident context
- Intelligent responder selection based on expertise

### Notification Management
- Multi-channel notifications (email, SMS, phone)
- Custom notification rules per team or individual
- Configurable notification delays
- Acknowledgment tracking
- Smart notification batching
- Context-rich alert messages

### Team Management
- Define team structures and responsibilities
- Set up team-specific schedules
- Configure team-based routing rules
