```
‚Üì *AI SRE Scribe processes this as:*
```
14:23 UTC - RECOVERY ACTION: Database failover completed successfully
```

**Technical Decision Capture** (Zoom)  
```
"After reviewing metrics, we've identified a memory leak in the payment service."
```
‚Üì *AI SRE Scribe processes this as:*
```
15:07 UTC - ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: Memory leak detected in payment service
```

**Action Item Tracking** (Slack)  
```
@sarah can you update the monitoring thresholds for the database connection pool?
```
‚Üì *AI SRE Scribe processes this as:*
