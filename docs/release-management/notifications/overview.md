Release Orchestration sends notifications for key events during release execution.

## Notification Events

You receive notifications for:
- **Release Start**: When a release execution starts
- **Pause for Input**: When a release pauses waiting for input (e.g., manual activity waiting for user input)
- **Release Completion**: When a release completes successfully
- **Release Failures**: When a release encounters failures

## Notification Purpose

Notifications help you:
- Stay informed about release status
- Know when action is required (e.g., manual activities waiting for input)
- Respond quickly to failures
- Track release progress
