# Expression Pipelines

## What are Expression Pipelines? 

A Feature Flag Expression Pipeline enables you to combine flags with additional features. These features include:
 - creating flags that can now be fixed, set to a runtime of your choice or can have added expressions,
 - setting the environment to now being fixed, set to a runtime of your choice or can also have added expressions,
 - changing the subsections on each of your flags which can now be fixed, have a runtime set and can also have added expressions too.
 - the ability to turn the default on or off within sub-sections.

The ability to build Expression Pipelines has evolved since its first introduction as before, it was limited to fixed, and runtime options for the combined flag changes section as a whole but you can now add the aditional features at the sub-section level as well!
