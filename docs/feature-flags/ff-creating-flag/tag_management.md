# Tagging Management Overview

## What is Tagging?

The Tagging Feature by Harness is a great way to organize and group your feature flags. You are able to create tags and assign them to, not only, categorize your Feature Flags, but also to manage permissions. 

This feature is incredibly exciting for our users as they can now create a resource group based on tags, environments or both when needed. The tags can also be used to support searching and filtering through your feature flags. Further to this, when creating a resource group using Tagging, you can further define permissions for users and for user groups.

## How To Use Tagging In Feature Flags

### Creating A Tag

There are two methods to creating a tag in Feature Flag. You can do this by either creating a new Feature Flag or by editing an existing one. Here are the steps you need to follow:

### Creating a Tag With A New Feature Flag

 1. On the Home Page of the Harness Application, head over to *Feature Flags*.
 2. Under the *Feature Flags* tab, click on *New Feature Flag*. 
 3. You may be asked to select between the type of Feature Flag you want to create which are either *Boolean* or *Multivariate*. Please select one of these choices. 
 3. Type the name of your Feature Flag and in the Tags box, type the name of your new tag and press *Enter*. 
 4. Press *Next* and go on to save your Flag. 
 5. Once saved, you should see the tags under your new Feature Flag. 

### Filtering Your Flags using Tags

  1. On the Home Page of the Harness Application, head over to *Feature Flags*.
  2. On the right hand side of the screen, you can type your tag or select the tag you want. 

### Editing A Tag 

![An image of a Feature Flag in the Harness Application. ](./static/feature_flag.png)

  1. On the Home Page of the Harness Application, head over to *Feature Flags*.
  2. Under the *Feature Flags* section, you should see a list of your existing flags. 
  3. Select a flag that has a tag that you want to edit by clicking the three dots at the end of the flag and selecting *Edit*. This includes flags that don't have any assigned tags.
  4. On the next page, select the three dots located next to the name of your flag followed by *Edit* in the small dropdown menu that appears. 
  5. You can, then, edit the tags or remove them or create a new one within the Tags box. 

To further expand on this, when you're creating and editing tags in Feature Flags, there are only certain special characters that are permitted to be a part of the tag name/identifier. 

The Regex is: 

`regexp.MustCompile("^[\\p{L}\\d .@_-]*$")`

This allows for these special characters to be used: `.`, `@`, `_` `-`

### Adding RBAC to Tags

RBAC (Role Based Access Control) is an area lets you control who can access your resources and what actions they can perform on the resources. You can do this by assigning tags to the users within the Resource Group. Here are the steps on how to do this:

 1. On the Home Page of the Harness Application, head over to *Feature Flags*.
 2. Under the *Feature Flags* tab, scroll down and click on the *Project Setup* dropdown menu. Click *Access Control*. 
 3. Click on the User you want to assign it to. If you do not have any users under this tab, click on *New User* on the top left of the screen and follow the steps to create one. 
 4. Under the *Resource Group* column, you'll find the Role and/or the Resource Group the user is assigned to. Click on the Resource Group. 
 5. On the left hand side should be a panel titled *Resources*. Scroll down until you reach the *Feature Flags* section and select your Resource Group. 
 6. On the right hand side of the page, select *By Tag*, followed by *Add Tag*.
 7. From there, you can asign any pre-existing tags to the Resource Group.
 8. The tags assigned to users will control their permissions to toggle flags within Feature Flags. Users under the assigned tags will be restricted based on the permissions you have granted them, such as the ability to toggle flags or make edits within Feature Flags. 
 9. Additionally, it's crucial to add Environments as a Resource Group. Do read the below subsection on *Environments As A Resource Group* to learn more. 

### Environments As A Resource Group

Additionally, it's crucial to add Environments as a Resource Group. This step helps limit the environments in which users can toggle a flag. By assigning tags to users within specific environments, you ensure that they only have access to toggle flags within those designated environments.
