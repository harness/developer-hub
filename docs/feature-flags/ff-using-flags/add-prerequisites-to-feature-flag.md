A Prerequisite is a Flag you add as a dependency that needs to be met before another Flag can be toggled `ON` or `OFF`. For example, if you have a Flag that allows users to write Java, the user must be able to read the Java first. Therefore, you add a Prerequisite that the `Read_Java` Flag must be enabled before the `Write_Java` Flag can be toggled on.Â 

### Add a Prerequisite

1. Go to the Feature Flag you want to add the Prerequisite to.
2. Click **+ New Prerequisite**.

```

*Figure 1: Adding a Prerequisite*

1. In **Add Prerequisites**, click **+ Prerequisites**.
2. In the first drop-down menu, select the Flag you want to use as a Prerequisite.
3. In the second drop-down, select which Variation of the Prerequisite Flag must be served before the Feature Flag can be turned on. For the example below, the Read\_Java Flag must be set to `True` before this Flag can be enabled.
4. Click **Save**. The Prerequisite Flag is listed on the Feature Flag page and must be met before you can turn on the Feature Flag.
