Follow the instructions below to create a Gitspace:

1. Click on **+New Gitspace**. To create a **Gitspace** using the [sample app](https://github.com/harness-community/demo-repo-nm). You have two options to create Gitspace:


import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs queryString="Create Gitspace">
<TabItem value="using-harness-code" label="Using Harness Code">

1. If you donâ€™t have a Harness Code Repository, you can either [create](https://developer.harness.io/docs/code-repository/config-repos/create-repo) one or [import](https://developer.harness.io/docs/code-repository/config-repos/import-repo) a new repository. 

2. Once the repository is available, you can select the **branch** and the **IDE** type (VSCode Browser and Desktop are supported)

3. Import the repository from third party git provider to Harness Code Repository, using the **organization** and the **repository** name. [Read](https://developer.harness.io/docs/code-repository/config-repos/import-repo) for more details

4. Now **Create Gitspace**, by selecting the default **branch** as `main` and **IDE**.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="other-git-repositories" label="Other Git Repositories">

1.You can add a public or private repository URL for git providers supported, make sure the public repository URL is strictly of the format `https://git-provider.com/organisation/repository` (For GitHub eg:`https://github.com/harness-community/demo-repo-nm`) any extra string post this might cause an error. If you have configured the OAuth, then you'll get the list of private repositories you have access to select from. 

2. By default the **branch** selected would be main which you can change according to your choice.

3. Now select the **IDE**

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Tabs queryString="Select IDE">
<TabItem value="vs-code-online" label="VS Code Browser">

- VS Code Browser can directly be started on your browser and doesn't require any pre-configuration. 
- You can select the IDE type as VS Code Browser and you'll redirected to the IDE on a new tab once the Gitspace is created and you click on **Open VS Code Editor**. 


</TabItem>
<TabItem value="vs-code-desktop" label="VS Code Desktop">
