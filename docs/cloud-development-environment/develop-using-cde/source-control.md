## Using the Supported Source Control Management Tools

For CDEs we use platform OAuth to connect with your git providers so you don't need to login to configure the CLIs, but since we use VS Code as IDE it only comes with pre-installed GitHub CLI, and we need to install the CLIs for other git providers.

import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

GitHub CLI comes pre-installed with VS Code IDE, now you need to configure your email-id and user-name before you could start pushing changes to upstream. 

```sh
git config --global user.email "you@example.com" 

git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

## Commit Changes to Upstream

1. Once you've made a few changes, you can use the **integrated termina**l or the **[source view](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/overview#_commit)** to commit your work. Here are the steps to use the Source Control view for this example.

2. To stage your changes, click **+** next to the file to stage the changes, or **next** to Changes if you've changed multiple files and you want to **stage** them all.

3. To **commit** your staged changes, type a **commit message** describing the change you've made, then click **Commit**.

4. Now Sync Changes, it will redirect you to login and authorize to your Source Provider once the authentication is successful, your changes will be committed to your fork.
