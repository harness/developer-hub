The Component Violations Dashboard for Artifacts and Repositories displays pipelines flagged for SBOM policy violations. It provides a centralized view across organizations and projects.

Follow the below steps to view component violations for artifacts. You can follow the same process to view Component violations for code repositories.

- **Total Pipeline Executions:** Count of all pipeline executions that include the SBOM Policy Enforcement step for artifacts.

- **Pipeline Executions with Component Violations:** Count of pipeline executions that resulted in SBOM policy violations for artifacts.

- **Total Artifacts Evaluated:** Unique count of artifacts that underwent the SBOM orchestration step.

- **Violated Artifacts:** Total number of artifacts that violated SBOM policies.

You can apply filters to drill down and navigate across the following key dimensions:

- **Organization:** Filter data by the selected Harness Organization.

- **Project:** Limit results to a specific project within the organization.

- **Pipeline Name:** Filter issues based on the pipeline name that executed the SBOM Policy Enforcement step.

- **Artifact Name:** Filter results by artifact name.

- **Date:** Filter by predefined presets (e.g., last 7 days) or a custom date range.


Click the ellipsis icon, in the top-right corner of the dashboard to download the component violations report (PDF or CSV), or set up automated delivery (daily, weekly, or monthly).


### Pipeline Execution Summary

Pipeline Execution Summary table lists the pipelines that violated the SBOM Allow/Deny List policy.

- **Pipeline Identifier:** Unique name/ID of the pipeline.

- **Org Identifier:** The organization to which the pipeline belongs.

- **Project Identifier:** The project the pipeline resides in.

- **Executions With Violations:** Number of pipeline executions that failed SBOM policy checks. When you **Click on** the violations count, this opens a pop-up table with the following columns:

   - **Artifact Name:** Name of the Artifact.

   - **Tag/Branch:** Branch or tag associated with the artifact.

   - **Pipeline Execution ID:** Unique ID of the pipeline execution. On click, it redirects you to the pipeline execution tab.

   - **Last Updated At Date:** Date when the pipeline execution was last updated with violation information.

- Executions Without Violations: Number of executions that passed the SBOM policy checks.
