Protect your software supply chain by safeguarding your artifacts from being compromised. Attackers may attempt to inject malicious code into your artifacts, aiming to tamper with your software supply chain. One of the primary goals of attackers is to get you to deploy compromised (or "poisoned") artifacts into your environments. In the worst-case scenario, your deployments could become a distribution channel for these poisoned artifacts, putting your customers and users at risk.

As artifacts pass through multiple stages in the software lifecycle, ensuring they remain secure and untampered is critical. Artifact signing provides a reliable way to guarantee that the artifact built at one stage is the exact same artifact consumed or deployed at the next, with no chance of compromise. This process builds trust, ensures integrity, and strengthens the security of your software supply chain.

## Artifact Signing process in SCS

The Artifact Signing step retrieves the artifact from the container registry, signs it using [Cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/signing/overview/) with a private key from a key pair, and generates a signature file `.sig`. Once the signature is successfully generated, it is pushed back to the same container registry alongside the artifact. This signature file is essential for verifying the artifact's integrity and authenticity. For more details on artifact verification, refer to the [Artifact Verification documentation](/docs/software-supply-chain-assurance/artifact//verify-signed-artifacts.md)

<!-- ## Requirements

### Generate the keys for Artifact Signing

import GenerateKeysPrerequisite from '/docs/software-supply-chain-assurance/shared/generate-cosign-artifact.md';

<GenerateKeysPrerequisite /> -->

## Artifact Signing step configuration

The Artifact Signing step allows you to sign your artifacts and optionally push the generated signature file `.sig` to the same artifact registry from which the artifact was retrieved.

You can search for **Artifact Signing** and add it to either the **Build** or **Security** stage of a Harness pipeline

:::note

At present, Harness does not support artifact signing in the deployment stage, However this is part of our roadmap.

:::

Follow the instructions below to configure the Artifact Signing step.

* **Name**: Provide a name for the signing step.

* **Artifact Source**: Select the source container registry (e.g., DockerHub, ACR, ECR, etc.).


:::warning Deprecation Alert

Google Container Registry (GCR) has been deprecated and shut down. As a result, we no longer support GCR for the Artifact Signing step

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="har" label="HAR" default>

* **Registry:** Select the Harness Registry configured for the Harness Artifact Registry where your artifact is stored.

* **Image:** Enter the name of your image with tag, such as `imagename:tag`.

</TabItem>


  <TabItem value="dockerhub" label="DockerHub">

* **Container Registry:** Select the [Docker Registry connector](/docs/platform/connectors/cloud-providers/ref-cloud-providers/docker-registry-connector-settings-reference) that is configured for the DockerHub container registry where the artifact is stored.

* **Image:** Enter the name of your image using a tag or digest, example `my-docker-org/repo-name:tag` or you can use the digest `my-docker-org/repo-name@sha256:<digest>`

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="ecr" label="ECR" default>

* **Container Registry:** Select the [Docker Registry connector](/docs/platform/connectors/cloud-providers/ref-cloud-providers/docker-registry-connector-settings-reference) that is configured for the Elastic container registry where the artifact is stored.

* **Image:** Enter the name of your image using a tag or digest, example `my-docker-repo/my-artifact:tag`or you can use the digest `my-docker-repo/my-artifact@sha256:<digest>`

* **Artifact Digest:** Specify the digest of your artifact. After building your image using the [Build and Push](#slsa-generation-step-configuration-with-build-and-push-step) step or a [Run](#slsa-generation-step-configuration-with-run-step) step, save the digest in a variable. You can then reference it here using a Harness expression. Refer to the workflows described below for detailed guidance.

* **Region:** The geographical location of your ECR repository, example `us-east-1`

* **Account ID:** The unique identifier associated with your AWS account.


</TabItem>

<TabItem value="acr" label="ACR" default>

* **Container Registry:** Select the [Docker Registry connector](/docs/platform/connectors/cloud-providers/ref-cloud-providers/docker-registry-connector-settings-reference) that is configured for the Azure container registry where the artifact is stored.

* **Image:** Enter your image details in the format `<registry-login-server>/<repository>`. The `<registry-login-server>` is a fully qualified name of your Azure Container Registry. It typically follows the format `<registry-name>.azurecr.io`, where   `<registry-name>` is the name you have given to your container registry instance in Azure. Example input: `automate.azurecr.io/<my-repo>:tag` or you can use digest `automate.azurecr.io/<my-repo>@sha256:<digest>`

* **Artifact Digest:** Specify the digest of your artifact. After building your image using the [Build and Push](#slsa-generation-step-configuration-with-build-and-push-step) step or a [Run](#slsa-generation-step-configuration-with-run-step) step, save the digest in a variable. You can then reference it here using a Harness expression. Refer to the workflows described below for detailed guidance.

* **Subscription Id:** Enter the unique identifier that is associated with your Azure subscription. 

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="gar" label="GAR" default>

* **Container Registry:** Select the [Docker Registry connector](/docs/platform/connectors/cloud-providers/ref-cloud-providers/docker-registry-connector-settings-reference) that is configured for the Google container registry where the artifact is stored.

* **Image:**: Enter the name of your image using tag or digest, example `repository-name/image:tag` or you can use digest `repository-name/image:digest`.

* **Artifact Digest:** Specify the digest of your artifact. After building your image using the [Build and Push](#slsa-generation-step-configuration-with-build-and-push-step) step or a [Run](#slsa-generation-step-configuration-with-run-step) step, save the digest in a variable. You can then reference it here using a Harness expression. Refer to the workflows described below for detailed guidance.

* **Host:** Enter your GAR Host name. The Host name is regional-based. For example, `us-east1-docker.pkg.dev`.

* **Project ID:** Enter the unique identifier of your Google Cloud Project. The Project-ID is a distinctive string that identifies your project across Google Cloud services. example: `my-gcp-project`

You can securely sign the artifacts using **Cosign** or **Cosign with Secret Manager**

import GenerateKeysPrerequisite from '/docs/software-supply-chain-assurance/shared/generate-cosign-artifact.md';

<GenerateKeysPrerequisite />



<DocImage path={require('./static/artifact-signnning.png')} width="50%" height="50%" />


**Attach Signature to Artifact Registry** (Optional): By default, this option is unchecked which means the signature will not be uploaded to the artifact registry and checking this option will push the signature as a `.sig` file to the artifact registry.

## View Signed Artifacts

You can easily access the signed artifact details from the [Artifacts Overview](/docs/software-supply-chain-assurance/artifact-view#artifact-overview) tab.This section shows the signature and who signed the artifact.Additionally, you can also find the artifact signing as an event in the Chain of Custody, where a new entry is logged every time you sign an artifact.This entry includes a link to the execution results and rekor log entry, allowing you to track the signing activity and cross-check the details.

<DocImage path={require('./static/artifact-signing-data.png')} width="100%" height="100%" />




:::note
You are allowed to re-sign the same image multiple times, with each new signing overwriting the previous one. The Artifacts Overview tab will always display the most up-to-date signing details, reflecting the latest signature information for the artifact.

## Example Pipeline For Artifact Signing

This example demonstrates how to implement artifact signing in the Build stage of the pipeline.


This example **Build** stage has two steps:

- **Build and Push an Image to Docker Registry**: This step builds the cloned codebase and pushes the image to the container registry (DockerHub, ACR, etc.).



- **Artifact Signing**: Pulls the artifact from the registry and signs it with a private key pair and pushes the `.sig` file back to the artifact registry.
