After you sign the artifact using the [Artifact Signing step](/docs/software-supply-chain-assurance/artifact/sign-artifacts), it’s crucial to verify that the artifact has not been tampered and was signed by a trusted source. The Artifact Verification process enables you to validate the integrity and authenticity of the signed artifact before it’s deployed.

:::note 
Currently, this feature is behind the feature flag `SSCA_ARTIFACT_SIGNING`. Contact Harness Support to enable the feature.

## Artifact Verification in SCS

The artifact verification step ensures the authenticity of the signed artifact by validating it with the corresponding public key. If the public key matches the signed artifact it confirms that the artifact is intact, secure, and originates from a trusted source.

## Artifact Verification step configuration

The Artifact Verification step pulls the `.sig` file from the artifact registry and verifies it with the corresponding public key. In the artifact signing step, if you chosen not to push the `.sig` file to the registry, then for the artifact verification `.sig` file will instead be pulled from the Harness database . This process ensures that the artifact was signed by a trusted entity, thereby confirming its integrity and authenticity.

You can search for **Artifact Verification** and add it to either the **Build** or **Security** stage of a Harness pipeline

:::note

At present, Harness does not support artifact verification in the deployment stage, However this is part of our roadmap.

:::

Follow the instructions below to configure the Artifact Verification step.

* **Name**: Provide a name for the verification step.

* **Artifact Source**: Select the source container registry (e.g., DockerHub, ACR, GCR, ECR, etc.).

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="dockerhub" label="DockerHub" default>

* **Container Registry:** Select the [Docker Registry connector](/docs/platform/connectors/cloud-providers/ref-cloud-providers/docker-registry-connector-settings-reference) that is configured for the DockerHub container registry where the artifact is stored.

* **Image:** Enter the name of your image using a tag or digest, example `my-docker-org/repo-name:tag` or you can use the digest `my-docker-org/repo-name@sha256:<digest>`

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="ecr" label="ECR" default>

* **Container Registry:** Select the [Docker Registry connector](/docs/platform/connectors/cloud-providers/ref-cloud-providers/docker-registry-connector-settings-reference) that is configured for the Elastic container registry where the artifact is stored.

* **Image:** Enter the name of your image using a tag or digest, example `my-docker-repo/my-artifact:tag`or you can use the digest `my-docker-repo/my-artifact@sha256:<digest>`

* **Artifact Digest:** Specify the digest of your artifact. After building your image using the [Build and Push](#slsa-generation-step-configuration-with-build-and-push-step) step or a [Run](#slsa-generation-step-configuration-with-run-step) step, save the digest in a variable. You can then reference it here using a Harness expression. Refer to the workflows described below for detailed guidance.

* **Region:** The geographical location of your ECR repository, example `us-east-1`

* **Account ID:** The unique identifier associated with your AWS account.


</TabItem>

<TabItem value="gcr" label="GCR" default>

* **Container Registry:** Select the [Docker Registry connector](/docs/platform/connectors/cloud-providers/ref-cloud-providers/docker-registry-connector-settings-reference) that is configured for the Google container registry where the artifact is stored.

* **Image:** Enter the name of your image using a tag or digest, example `my-image:tag` or you can use digest `my-image@sha256:<digest>`

* **Artifact Digest:** Specify the digest of your artifact. After building your image using the [Build and Push](#slsa-generation-step-configuration-with-build-and-push-step) step or a [Run](#slsa-generation-step-configuration-with-run-step) step, save the digest in a variable. You can then reference it here using a Harness expression. Refer to the workflows described below for detailed guidance.

* **Host:** Enter your GCR Host name. The Host name is regional-based. For instance, a common Host name is `gcr.io`, which serves as a multi-regional hostname for the United States. 

* **Project ID:** Enter the unique identifier of your Google Cloud Project. The Project-ID is a distinctive string that identifies your project across Google Cloud services. example: `my-gcp-project`


</TabItem>

<TabItem value="acr" label="ACR" default>

* **Container Registry:** Select the [Docker Registry connector](/docs/platform/connectors/cloud-providers/ref-cloud-providers/docker-registry-connector-settings-reference) that is configured for the Azure container registry where the artifact is stored.

* **Image:** Enter your image details in the format `<registry-login-server>/<repository>`. The `<registry-login-server>` is a fully qualified name of your Azure Container Registry. It typically follows the format `<registry-name>.azurecr.io`, where   `<registry-name>` is the name you have given to your container registry instance in Azure. Example input: `automate.azurecr.io/<my-repo>:tag` or you can use digest `automate.azurecr.io/<my-repo>@sha256:<digest>`

* **Artifact Digest:** Specify the digest of your artifact. After building your image using the [Build and Push](#slsa-generation-step-configuration-with-build-and-push-step) step or a [Run](#slsa-generation-step-configuration-with-run-step) step, save the digest in a variable. You can then reference it here using a Harness expression. Refer to the workflows described below for detailed guidance.

* **Subscription Id:** Enter the unique identifier that is associated with your Azure subscription. 

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="gar" label="GAR" default>

* **Container Registry:** Select the [Docker Registry connector](/docs/platform/connectors/cloud-providers/ref-cloud-providers/docker-registry-connector-settings-reference) that is configured for the Google container registry where the artifact is stored.

* **Image:**: Enter the name of your image using tag or digest, example `repository-name/image:tag` or you can use digest `repository-name/image:digest`

* **Artifact Digest:** Specify the digest of your artifact. After building your image using the [Build and Push](#slsa-generation-step-configuration-with-build-and-push-step) step or a [Run](#slsa-generation-step-configuration-with-run-step) step, save the digest in a variable. You can then reference it here using a Harness expression. Refer to the workflows described below for detailed guidance.

* **Host:** Enter your GAR Host name. The Host name is regional-based. For example, `us-east1-docker.pkg.dev`.

* **Project ID:** Enter the unique identifier of your Google Cloud Project. The Project-ID is a distinctive string that identifies your project across Google Cloud services. example: `my-gcp-project`

</TabItem>


</Tabs>

:::note

Ensure that you use the same image that was used for artifact signing in the Artifact Signing step.

:::

You can verify the signed artifact with **Cosign** or **Cosign with Secret Manager**

import CosignVerificationOptions from '/docs/software-supply-chain-assurance/shared/cosign-verification-options.md';

<CosignVerificationOptions />


<DocImage path={require('./static/artifact-verifyying.png')} width="50%" height="50%" />

## View Verified Artifacts

Once the artifact is signed and verified, you will be able to see the Artifact Integrity Verification status from the [Artifacts Overview](/docs/software-supply-chain-assurance/artifact-view#artifact-overview) tab.


* If the signed artifact is successfully verified using the public key, the verification status is displayed as Passed, along with the links to the corresponding Rekor log entry and the execution results.

* If the verification fails, the status is displayed as Failed.

## Example Pipeline For Artifact Verification

This example demonstrates how to implement artifact Verification in the Build stage of the pipeline.


This example **Build** stage has three steps:

- **Build and Push an Image to Docker Registry**: This step builds the cloned codebase and pushes the image to the container registry (DockerHub, ACR, GCR, etc.).



- **Artifact Signing**: Pulls the artifact from the registry and signs it with a private key pair and pushes the `.sig` file back to the artifact registry.


- **Artifact Verification**: Verifies the signed artifact using the corresponding public key to confirm its source and integrity.
