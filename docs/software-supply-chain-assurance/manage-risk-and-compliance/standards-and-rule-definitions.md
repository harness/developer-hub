The **Rule Definitions** section offers a complete list of all the standards and associated rules supported by Harness SCS. These rules are applied to various target types, and the overall compliance posture is presented in the Compliance section of SCS. To learn more about managing the compliance status, refer to the document [Manage Compliance Posture](./manage-compliance-posture)


<DocImage path={require('./static/compliance-ruldefinitons.png')} width="100%" height="100%" title="Click to view full size image" />


The page offers details about the rule, including its description, severity (defined by Harness), the standard with the rule ID to which it belongs, and the target type to which it applies (e.g., code repository, artifact, CI/CD).

You can apply filters specific to standards to view the rules associated with those standards and use the search function to find specific rules.

:::note

In the future, Harness will allow you to modify the severity of a rule or even suppress any rules from being evaluated.

## Supported Standards and Rules

Harness supports the following standards.

* CIS Benchmarks for GitHub
* OWASP Top 10 CI/CD Security Risks for GitHub
* Harness Standards


### CIS Benchmarks

The following CIS v1.0 rules are supported by Harness for the evaluations, and Harness will continue to add more rules across different target types. For more detailed information, refer to the official [CIS documentation](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/software-supply-chain-security)
