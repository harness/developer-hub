Open source software plays a critical role in the software landscape, with studies showing that over 90% of codebases contain open source components. While it accelerates development and innovation, it can also introduce security risks if not managed carefully. By assessing the components listed in your Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) against [OWASP Top 10 risks](/docs/software-supply-chain-assurance/manage-risk-and-compliance/standards-and-rule-definitions#oss-top-10-risks) helps to uncover risks such as [outdated](/docs/software-supply-chain-assurance/manage-risk-and-compliance/opensource-security-risk-management#outdated-components-oss-risk---5), [unmaintained](/docs/software-supply-chain-assurance/manage-risk-and-compliance/opensource-security-risk-management#unmaintained-components-oss-risk---4) or [end of life components](/docs/software-supply-chain-assurance/manage-risk-and-compliance/opensource-security-risk-management#end-of-life-components), ensuring your OSS dependencies remain secure, reliable, and up to date. Running OSS risk checks plays a vital role in strengthening your software supply chain and maintaining trust in your applications.

After completing the SBOM Orchestration step for your [artifacts](/docs/software-supply-chain-assurance/open-source-management/generate-sbom-for-artifacts) or [repositories](/docs/software-supply-chain-assurance/open-source-management/generate-sbom-for-repositories), the [SBOM tab](/docs/software-supply-chain-assurance/artifact-security/overview#sbom-tab) will display the below components marked with specific icons that indicate their current status.

- Vulnerabilities in SBOM Components 

- Outdated Components 

- Unmaintained Components 

- Close to End Of Life Components

- End Of Life Components

:::note

- We set the refresh interval for OSS component data to every 2 days. After you run the SBOM Orchestration step, the data is updated asynchronously within 5 â€“ 10 minutes.

- Detection of EOL and Close to EOL components is currently supported for npm, Maven, and PyPI. Support for additional package managers will be added in the future.

### Vulnerabilities in SBOM Components (OSS Risk - 1):

After you run the SBOM Orchestration step followed by an STO scan using Snyk or Aqua Trivy, the SBOM tab displays vulnerabilities for the components identified by the selected scan tool. This helps you effectively identify and prioritize open source risks


You can also filter out the components, based on the OWASP Top 10 Risks.

### Outdated Components (OSS Risk - 5):

A component is considered outdated when its current version is lower than the latest available version. In the SBOM tab, outdated components are indicated by a warning symbol next to their version. Create a [Jira ticket](/docs/software-supply-chain-assurance/manage-risk-and-compliance/opensource-security-risk-management#create-jira-ticket) to update the component version to the latest available version.

### Unmaintained Components (OSS Risk - 4):

An unmaintained component is one that has not received any version upgrades in the past year. In the SBOM tab, such components are marked with an alert symbol. Create a [Jira ticket](/docs/software-supply-chain-assurance/manage-risk-and-compliance/opensource-security-risk-management#create-jira-ticket) to replace it with an alternative component.

### Close to End of Life Components

A component is considered Close to End of Life if its EOL risk score falls between `30 and 59`. This score is based on warning signals such as declining maintenance, lack of updates, or unresolved security issues, which indicate that the component may soon reach EOL.

### End of Life Components

A component is considered End of Life if its EOL risk score falls between `60 and 100`. These components are typically no longer maintained or have been officially deprecated, making them risky to use in production. Harness SCS categorizes EOL into two types:

**Derived:** No official deprecation, but inferred based on risk signals and EOL scoring.

**Definite:** Confirmed end-of-life, such as when the package or repository is archived or officially deprecated.

When you click on any **Close to EOL or EOL component**, a side panel opens where you can view detailed information about the component, including its EOL status, risk score, and key findings. Learn more about the [EOL Scoring System](/docs/software-supply-chain-assurance/how-to-guides/eol-scoring-system).

### Create Jira Ticket

As a prerequisite, configure a [Jira connector](/docs/platform/connectors/ticketing-systems/connect-to-jira/). Click on the module selector at the top left of the side bar, go to Unified View, and create the connector at the project level.

- Select the outdated/unmaintained dependency, close to EOL or EOL components, which will open a side panel. Click on Create Ticket.
- **Create in Project:** Select the Jira project where the issue should be created. This list is populated based on your configured Jira connector.
- **Issue Type:** Choose the type of Jira issue to create.
- **Title:** The field will be auto-populated in the format below:
    - **For outdated components** - Outdated Component Identified - Upgrade `<component_name>` from `<current_version>` to `<latest_version>`
    - **For unmaintained components** - Unmaintained Component Identified - `<component_name>` version `<current_version>`
    - **For close to end of life components** - Close to EOL risk: `component-name` dependency requires upgrade or alternative.
    - **For end of life components** - EOL risk: `component-name` dependency requires alternative.
- **Description:** Add the details that you want to include in the Jira ticket description.

 Once the ticket is created, its number and current status will be displayed. Any changes to the status of the ticket will automatically synced and be reflected in the side panel.

### Enforce Policy

In the SBOM Orchestration step, you can enforce an OPA policy to block pipelines that include End of Life (EOL) components based on their count. The following is a sample policy:


```
package sbom

import future.keywords.if
import future.keywords.in

deny[result] {
    summary := input[0].outcome.stepArtifacts.publishedSbomArtifacts[0].ossRisksSummary

    # Rule 1 - Too many total EOL components
    summary.totalEolComponentCount > 100
    result := {
        "rule_name": "total_eol_components_check",
        "description": sprintf("Found %d total End-of-Life components", [summary.totalEolComponentCount]),
        "severity": "HIGH",
        "details": {
            "totalEolComponentCount": summary.totalEolComponentCount,
            "message": "Pipeline should fail when too many EOL components are found"
        }
    }
}

deny[result] {
    summary := input[0].outcome.stepArtifacts.publishedSbomArtifacts[0].ossRisksSummary

    # Rule 2 - Definite EOL components

    }
}

deny[result] {
    summary := input[0].outcome.stepArtifacts.publishedSbomArtifacts[0].ossRisksSummary

    # Rule 3 - Derived EOL components
    summary.derivedEolComponentCount > 50
    result := {

        }
    }
}

deny[result] {
    summary := input[0].outcome.stepArtifacts.publishedSbomArtifacts[0].ossRisksSummary

    # Rule 4 - Close to EOL components
    summary.closeToEolComponentCount > 200
    result := {
        "rule_name": "close_to_eol_components_check",
        "description": sprintf("Found %d components that are close to EOL", [summary.closeToEolComponentCount]),
        "severity": "HIGH",
        "details": {
            "closeToEolComponentCount": summary.closeToEolComponentCount,
            "message": "Pipeline execution should fail when close-to-EOL components are detected"
        }
    }
}

deny[result] {
    summary := input[0].outcome.stepArtifacts.publishedSbomArtifacts[0].ossRisksSummary

    # Rule 5 - Unmaintained components
    summary.unmaintainedComponentCount > 500
    result := {
        "rule_name": "unmaintained_components_check",
        "description": sprintf("Found %d unmaintained components", [summary.unmaintainedComponentCount]),
        "severity": "HIGH",
        "details": {
            "unmaintainedComponentCount": summary.unmaintainedComponentCount,
            "message": "Pipeline should fail when unmaintained components exceed threshold"
        }
    }
}

deny[result] {
    summary := input[0].outcome.stepArtifacts.publishedSbomArtifacts[0].ossRisksSummary

    # Rule 6 - Outdated components
    summary.outdatedComponentCount > 10000
    result := {
        "rule_name": "outdated_components_check",
        "description": sprintf("Found %d outdated components", [summary.outdatedComponentCount]),
        "severity": "MEDIUM",
        "details": {
            "outdatedComponentCount": summary.outdatedComponentCount,
            "message": "Consider upgrading outdated components to latest versions"
        }
    }
}
