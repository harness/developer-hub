The Compliance section within the SCS module serves as a hub for assessing and understanding the risk posture of your entire supply chain. This section is indispensable for GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) and security teams as it provides detailed evaluation results after applying all relevant rules to various target types within your supply chain. You can access a thorough summary of these evaluations, including the specific rules applied, their execution statuses, and the target types impacted by each rule.

To learn more about the supported standards and the rules applied to targets, please refer to the documentation on [Standards and Rule Definitions](./manage-compliance-posture).

:::note
Currently Harness supports Code Repositories, and CI/CD. Please refer to the [Use SCS](../get-started/onboarding-guide#use-scs) section in the onboarding document to see the full list of supported integrations for each feature. In the near future, Harness will add support for other target types and integrations.

* **Evaluation Breakdown**: A summary of rules passing versus failing. 
* **Failure by Severity**: Displays the number of failures categorized by severity levels: critical, high, medium, and low. 
* **Evaluation Trend**: This graph presents the trend of evaluations over time, showing the number of rules passing and failing with respect to the date. It helps users visualize the improvement or decline in the security posture.
* **Rules that Failed the Most Often**: Highlights the rules with the highest number of evaluation failures. 
* **Evaluation by Type**: Presents the number of failures in each category, which includes code repositories, artifacts, and CI/CD tools. 

Additionally, users can apply filters based on standards to view evaluations and details specific to each standard. The history of the data can be viewed for the last 24 hours, 7 days, and 30 days.


## View Rule Evaluations

The Rules tab in the “Compliance” section provides a detailed view of all the rules and their complete execution details applied across all the targets configured. For each rule, along with its name and description, the view provides the following information:

* **Evaluations**: Displays the total number of evaluations occurred, indicating whether they passed or failed, and the total number of targets to which the rule is applied (e.g., code repositories, artifacts, CI/CD tools).
* **Severity**: Presents the severity of each rule, categorized as critical, high, medium, or low.
* **Standard:** Indicates the standard to which the rule belongs and the rule's ID according to the official ID convention.

Users can view rules filtered by standards and apply an additional filter specific to severity. Also, users can perform searches within the filtered results. The history of the data can be viewed for the last 24 hours, 7 days, and 30 days.


## View Impacted Target

Upon clicking a rule in the Rules tab, you will see a list of all the targets impacted by the evaluation. This page provides information about the rule, its description, evaluation history and general remediation steps to address any failures.

Clicking on an item will bring up the latest evaluation details. Alternatively, you can click on an icon from the evaluation history to view specific evaluation details. The information includes the time of evaluation, the reason for failure (if failed), and the remediation information to address the issues.
