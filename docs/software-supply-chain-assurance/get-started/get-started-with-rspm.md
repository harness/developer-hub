This guide will help you onboard into the Repository Security Posture Management (RSPM) feature in Harness. The process consists of two main steps: configuring your integrations and selecting your resources.

If you've already configured your integrations and want to explore the RSPM features, please visit the Repository Security Posture Management documentation

:::note
The current onboarding process supports only GitHub. Support for other integrations will be added soon.

## Configure Your Integrations

Navigate to the “Get Started” section in the SSCA module. The process happens in two steps, which you can initiate by clicking on “Get Started.”

1. Select “Code Repositories” when asked, "What would you like to secure?"
2. Choose “GitHub” as the integration type.
3. Click “Launch GitHub to configure” to proceed.

You will be redirected to the Harness-SSCA GitHub app to configure the app for connection with Harness SSCA.


### Configuring the GitHub App: Harness-SSCA

Configuring the Harness-SSCA app allows SSCA to connect with your GitHub and fetch necessary information for setting up repository posture management.



1. Visit the [Harness-SSCA GitHub app](https://github.com/apps/harness-ssca) and click the ‘Configure’ button.

2. Authorize Harness by selecting the organization where you want to install the app.

:::note
If the button says "Authorize and Request" instead of "Install and Authorize," you don’t have permission to install the GitHub App. Please contact your GitHub admin for permissions. For detailed information about permissions, refer to the [Integrations and Permissions](../integrations-and-permissions) document.

3. Grant access to repositories. You can either select all repositories or choose specific ones. By default, Harness performs scans on your repositories every 24 hours.

After configuring, you will be redirected back to the Harness “Get Started” flow, where you can choose the list of repositories. The list will show the repositories already selected through your integration. You can modify your selection here or finish the onboarding.

While selecting repositories, you also have the option to automatically add any newly created repositories in the future. To enable this, simply check the option “_Automatically add all future repositories owned by the resource owner._”

Once your selection is done, click on “Finish.”

After clicking “Finish,” a pipeline is triggered to perform operations on the selected repositories. You will be redirected to the Integrations page, where you can check the status of the integration.

## View code repositories
To view all the selected repositories, navigate to the “Code Repositories” section. It might take some time for all repositories to be listed as the pipeline needs to complete. For more information about this process and the Code Repository section, refer to the [Repository Security Posture Management documentation](../repository-security-posture-management-rspm.md)
