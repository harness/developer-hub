You can see the quality score of every SBOM that’s generated by SCS module. This feature evaluates the quality of the Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) in various categories, utilizing a scoring system ranging from 0 to 10.

## Scoring Criteria

The SBOM Quality Score is calculated based on the following categories:

**NTIA-Minimum-Elements**: Assesses compliance with NTIA minimum element guidelines.

**Structural**: Checks adherence to underlying specifications of SPDX or CycloneDX.

**Semantic**: Evaluates the correctness of SBOM field meanings specific to their standard.

**Quality**: Determines the overall data quality present in the SBOM.

**Sharing**: Assesses the SBOM's readiness for sharing.

Each category contributes to an overall score reflecting the SBOM's quality, compliance, and readiness for sharing.

## How It Works

**SBOM Generation**: Upon generating an SBOM in SCS, it undergoes quality scoring.

**Scoring Process**: The [sbomqs](https://github.com/interlynk-io/sbomqs/) tool evaluates the SBOM across the defined categories.

**Score Display**: The final score, ranging from 0 to 10, is displayed alongside the SBOM details within SCS.

## Viewing the Score
You can view the scores of all generated SBOMs from the **Artifacts view**. Additionally, the score of an SBOMs generated from a specific pipeline execution can be found in the **Supply Chain** tab within the pipeline execution window.

### Artifact view in SCS

Click on the [Artifacts](../artifact-view.md) section in the left-hand panel which lists all the artifacts. Choose any one of the artifacts,to access a detailed list of all associated digests of the artifact.You can view the corresponding score alongside the SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) in the SBOM column

## Score Interpretation

**Score Range**: 0 (lowest) to 10 (highest).

**Higher Scores**: Indicate better quality, compliance, and readiness for sharing.

**Lower Scores**: Suggest areas for improvement or further investigation.
