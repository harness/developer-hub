You can use Harness SSCA to achieve [SLSA](https://slsa.dev/) Level 2 compliance by generating [SLSA Provenance](https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/provenance) according to the [SLSA v1.0 spec](https://slsa.dev/). You can also use SSCA to [verify SLSA Provenance](./verify-slsa.md).

## Prepare a pipeline

To generate SLSA Provenance in Harness, you need a pipeline with a [CI (build) stage](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/prep-ci-pipeline-components).

## Generate a key pair

Keys are used to sign and verify provenance.

1. Generate a public and private key pair. For example, you can use [Cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/key_management/signing_with_self-managed_keys/) to generate key pairs.
2. Create two [Harness file secrets](/docs/platform/secrets/add-file-secrets), one for the private key file and one for the public key file.
3. Create a [Harness text secret](/docs/platform/Secrets/add-use-text-secrets) to store the password for the private key.

## Enable SLSA Provenance generation

Enable SLSA Provenance generation in the **Build** stage settings.

1. In your Harness pipeline, select the **Build** stage, and then select the **Overview** tab.
2. Under **SLSA Provenance**, enable **Generate SLSA Provenance**.
3. For **Private Key**, select the [Harness file secret](/docs/platform/secrets/add-file-secrets) containing the private key file to use to sign the attestation.
4. For **Password**, select the [Harness text secret](/docs/platform/Secrets/add-use-text-secrets) containing the password for the private key.

You can also add [provenance verification](./verify-slsa.md) to your pipeline.

## Run the pipeline

When you run a pipeline with SLSA generation enabled, Harness SSCA:

* Generates an SLSA Provenance for the image created in the **Build** stage.
* Generates and signs an attestation using the provided key and password.
* Stores the SLSA Provenance in Harness and uploads the `.att` file to your container registry alongside the image.

The signed attestation is stored, as an `.att` file, in the artifact repository along with the image. You can also find the SLSA Provenance on the **Artifacts** tab on the **Execution details** page in Harness. For more information, go to [View attestations and violations](../ssca-view-results.md).

## Provenance example

Here's an example of an SLSA Provenance generated by Harness SSCA. The information in your SLSA Provenance might vary depending on your build and changes to the provenance structure applied in SSCA updates. Identifiers, repo names, and other details in this example are anonymized or truncated.
