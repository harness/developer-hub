* **Registry:** Select the Harness Registry configured for the Harness Artifact Registry where your artifact is stored.

* **Image:** Enter the name of your image with tag or digest, such as `imagename:tag` or `imagename:digest`.

</TabItem>


  <TabItem value="dockerhub" label="DockerHub" default>

* **Container Registry:** Select the [Docker Registry connector](/docs/platform/connectors/cloud-providers/ref-cloud-providers/docker-registry-connector-settings-reference) that is configured for the DockerHub container registry where the artifact is stored.

* **Image:** Enter the name of your image using either a tag or a digest. For example: `my-docker-org/repo-name:tag` or `my-docker-org/repo-name@sha256:<digest>`


</TabItem>

<TabItem value="ecr" label="ECR" default>

* **Container Registry:** Select the [Docker Registry connector](/docs/platform/connectors/cloud-providers/ref-cloud-providers/docker-registry-connector-settings-reference) that is configured for the Elastic container registry where the artifact is stored.

* **Image:** Enter the name of your image with tag or digest for the image for which you're generating an SBOM, such as `my-docker-repo/my-artifact:latest` or `my-docker-repo/my-artifact@sha256:<digest>`.

* **Region:** The geographical location of your ECR repository.

* **Account ID:** The unique identifier associated with your AWS account.

<TabItem value="gar" label="GAR" default>

* **Container Registry:** Select the [Docker Registry connector](/docs/platform/connectors/cloud-providers/ref-cloud-providers/docker-registry-connector-settings-reference) that is configured for the Google artifact registry where the artifact is stored.

* **Image:** Enter the name of your image with tag or digest for which you're generating the SBOM, example `repository-name/image:tag` or `repository-name/image@sha256:<digest>`.

* **Host:** Enter your GAR Host name. The Host name is regional-based. For example, `us-east1-docker.pkg.dev`.

* **Project ID:** Enter the unique identifier of your Google Cloud Project. The Project-ID is a distinctive string that identifies your project across Google Cloud services. example: `my-gcp-project`

* **Image:** Enter your image details with a tag or digest in the format `<registry-login-server>/<repository>:<tag>` or `<registry-login-server>/<repository>@sha256:<digest>`. The `<registry-login-server>` is a fully qualified name of your Azure Container Registry. It typically follows the format `<registry-name>.azurecr.io`, where   `<registry-name>` is the name you have given to your container registry instance in Azure. Example input: `automate.azurecr.io/acr:test`

* **Subscription Id:** Enter the unique identifier that is associated with your Azure subscription.

    :::info

    The **Repository** option requires that your repository is cloned into the stage workspace before the SBOM Orchestration step runs. There are several ways you can do this:
    * Clone the codebase by default, such as a [Build stage's default codebase](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/codebase-configuration/create-and-configure-a-codebase).
    * Add a [Git Clone step](https://developer.harness.io/docs/continuous-delivery/x-platform-cd-features/cd-steps/containerized-steps/git-clone-step/) or [Run step](https://developer.harness.io/docs/continuous-delivery/x-platform-cd-features/cd-steps/containerized-steps/run-step/) to the Deploy stage.
    * Add a [Git Clone step or Run step to a Build stage](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/codebase-configuration/clone-and-process-multiple-codebases-in-the-same-pipeline).

    :::
* **Repository URL:** The Repository URL you've configured for cloning into the workspace.
* **Source Path:** Leave blank or enter a path (in the repository) for which you want to generate SBOM. Use this setting to generate SBOM for a specific section of your code repo, rather than your entire repo. The path must start with `/`.
   For example, if your repository URL is `https://github.com/username/repo`, and you want to generate SBOM for `https://github.com/username/repo/service-core/source`, then enter `/service-core/source` for **Source Path**.
   To generate an SBOM for the entire repository, leave this field empty.
* **Git Branch:** The branch of the repository for which you want to generate the SBOM.
* **Workspace:** If you cloned the codebase to a different directory than the root workspace directory (`/harness`), enter the path to the subdirectory using the format `/harness/PATH/TO/SUBDIRECTORY`. Leave this field empty if you cloned your codebase into the default directory (`/harness`). Usually, your codebase is only cloned into a non-default directory if you are [cloning multiple codebases](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/codebase-configuration/clone-and-process-multiple-codebases-in-the-same-pipeline) into a pipeline.
