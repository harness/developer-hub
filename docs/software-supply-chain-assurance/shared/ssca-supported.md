This document outlines the platforms, features, and integrations supported by Harness SCS.
The Supply Chain Security (SCS) module is available on the following platforms:
- [Harness SaaS](#scs-on-harness-saas)
- [Harness Self-Managed Enterprise Edition](#connected-environment)
- [Harness Self-Managed Enterprise Edition in Air-gapped/Offline Environments](#air-gapped-environment)

### SCS on Harness SaaS
- Repository Security Posture Management - [RSPM](/docs/software-supply-chain-assurance/manage-risk-and-compliance/repository-security-posture-management-rspm)
- [Generate](/docs/software-supply-chain-assurance/open-source-management/generate-sbom-for-repositories) or [ingest](/docs/software-supply-chain-assurance/open-source-management/ingest-sbom-data) SBOM, followed by SBOM drift detection and scoring.
- [Enforce OSS usage with SBOM governance policies](/docs/software-supply-chain-assurance/open-source-management/enforce-sbom-policies).
- Generate [SLSA](/docs/software-supply-chain-assurance/artifact-security/slsa/generate-slsa) provenance and achieve Build [Levels 1](/docs/software-supply-chain-assurance/artifact-security/slsa/overview#how-to-comply-with-slsa-level-1), [2](/docs/software-supply-chain-assurance/artifact-security/slsa/overview#how-to-comply-with-slsa-level-2), and [3](/docs/software-supply-chain-assurance/artifact-security/slsa/overview#how-to-comply-with-slsa-level-3).
- [Verify SLSA provenance](/docs/software-supply-chain-assurance/artifact-security/slsa/verify-slsa) with [SLSA governance policies](/docs/software-supply-chain-assurance/artifact-security/slsa/verify-slsa#enforce-policies-on-slsa-provenance).
- Attest and verify SBOM and SLSA Provenance with Cosign.
- Create and manage [Remediation Trackers](/docs/software-supply-chain-assurance/open-source-management/remediation-tracker/create-remediation-tracker).

### SCS on Harness Self-Managed Enterprise Edition (SMP)

#### Connected Environment
All features of '[SCS on Harness SaaS](#scs-on-harness-saas)' are available in an SMP environment, with the following exceptions:

- Creating a Remediation tracker will require manually adding the CVE details as auto-population is linked with STO module. However, if you are using Harness STO SMP, this limitation does not apply.
- Achieving [SLSA Level 3](/docs/software-supply-chain-assurance/artifact-security/slsa/overview#how-to-comply-with-slsa-level-3) compliance is not possible in SMP, as it requires Harness hosted build infrastructure. This capability is available through '[SCS on Harness SaaS](#scs-on-harness-saas)'.


#### Air-gapped Environment
All features of '[SCS on Harness SaaS](#scs-on-harness-saas)' are available in an air-gapped or offline environment, with the following exceptions:

- Repository Security Posture Management is not supported in air-gapped environments.
- In the generated SBOMs, the license data for certain dependencies will be marked as "NOASSERTION", leading to a reduced SBOM quality score. However, this does not impact the SBOM generation or any other features of [SBOM Orchestration](/docs/software-supply-chain-assurance/open-source-management/generate-sbom-for-repositories).
- Logging the attestation record in the Sigstore public [Rekor](https://docs.sigstore.dev/logging/overview/) will not be performed during the SBOM and SLSA Provenance attestation process, but this will not impact the attestation itself.
- Creating a Remediation tracker will require manually adding the CVE details as auto-population is linked with STO module. However, if you are using Harness STO SMP, this limitation does not apply.
- Achieving [SLSA Level 3](/docs/software-supply-chain-assurance/artifact-security/slsa/overview#how-to-comply-with-slsa-level-3) compliance is not possible in SMP, as it requires Harness hosted build infrastructure. This capability is available through '[SCS on Harness SaaS](#scs-on-harness-saas)'.
