To perform the attestation process, you need to input the private key and password. You can use your preferred key generation services or use [Cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/key_management/overview/) to generate them. Here's how you can generate keys using Cosign:

1. [Install Cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/system_config/installation/)
2. Run the command `cosign generate-key-pair` to generate the key pairs.
3. Make sure to note the password used for generating the key pairs. This password is needed for attestation verification purpose.
4. This command will generate a private key as a `.key` file and a public key as a `.pub` file. To securely store these files, use [Harness file secret](/docs/platform/secrets/add-file-secrets).
