The SBOM, SLSA Provenance, attestations, and policy enforcement results generated by SSCA are stored in Harness or your container registry. This topic explains where to find this data.

## SBOM, SLSA Provenance, and attestations

When an SBOM or SLSA Provenance is generated, along with a signed attestation, in a Harness pipeline run, the signed attestation (which includes the SBOM or SLSA Provenance) is stored, as an `.att` file, in the artifact repository along with the image.

<docimage path={require('./static/view-result-att-in-docker-hub.png')} />

On the **Execution details** page in Harness, you can view and download SBOM and SLSA Provenance from the **Artifacts** tab.

If your pipeline has multiple stages, the **Artifacts** tab is filtered by stage. Use the dropdown menu to select the relevant stage.

## SSCA policy violations

If your pipeline included an **SSCA Enforcement** step, you can see the number of policy violations in the **Violations** column on the **Artifacts** tab.
