Harness is a comprehensive CI/CD platform that streamlines software delivery for modern enterprises. It provides a powerful and user-friendly interface for managing software releases, deployments, and rollbacks.

You can interact with the Harness platform through the Harness UI. It is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, while also providing robust features and capabilities for managing software releases.

The Harness UI is organized into several key areas. This topic explains how you can:

- View your account and profile information.
- View subscription details.
- Navigate and select modules.

## Harness Navigation version 2.0

:::note

Currently, Harness Navigation version 2.0 is behind the feature flag `CDS_NAV_2_0`. Contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io) to enable the feature.

:::

The new navigation is designed to cater to different personas, address their needs, and reduce task completion time. Once the navigation is enabled on your account, you will notice a different side panel and modules menu on the top.

We have introduced a multi-module mode and a single module mode for working across multiple modules or focusing on a specific module. You can configure the side panel to show or hide specific modules.

This video provides a walkthrough of the new navigation experience and highlights its benefits.

## Projects

A Harness project is a group of Harness modules, their pipelines, and resources. For example, a project might have a Harness CI pipeline to build code and push an image and a Harness CD pipeline to deploy that image to a cloud platform.

For more information, see [Create Organizations and Projects](/docs/platform/organizations-and-projects/create-an-organization).

## Deployments

The **Deployments** module in Harness is designed to provide visibility and control over the deployment process, making it easier to manage and troubleshoot deployments across multiple projects and environments. You can create your CD pipelines in this module and view the status of all deployments across all projects, filter and sort the deployments based on various criteria, and drill down into the details of individual deployments.

For more information, see [Continuous Delivery & GitOps](/docs/continuous-delivery).

## Builds

The **Builds** module in Harness is a component of the platform that provides a centralized view of all the builds that have been executed or are currently in progress. It allows you to manage and monitor your build activity across all your projects and environments.

For more information, see [Continuous Integration](/docs/continuous-integration).

## Feature Flags

Feature flags are a key component of Harness that allows you to control the availability and behavior of specific features in your application. With feature flags, you can release new features to specific groups of users, test features before making them available to all users, and gradually roll out features to ensure a smooth transition.

For more information, see [Feature Flags](/docs/feature-flags)
