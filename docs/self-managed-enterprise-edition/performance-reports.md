This topic includes a series of test reports focusing on the performance and scalability of Harness Self-Managed Enterprise Edition. The reports provide detailed insights into the test environment, resource configurations, test scenarios, and their outcomes.

The test reports offer valuable insights into the performance, scalability, and reliability of Harness Self-Managed Enterprise Edition. They demonstrate the platform's capability to handle concurrent CI/CD executions effectively across different scenarios and workload conditions. The detailed results and observations serve as a reference for evaluating the platform's suitability for various deployment environments and project requirements.

## Test environment

The test reports document the environment in which the performance tests were conducted. This includes details such as the Kubernetes version used (GKE), the database configuration (Mongo Atlas M60), and the Redis setup (GCP Memory Store).

## Harness services

The reports outline the various services utilized within the Harness Self-Managed Enterprise Edition, deployed using Helm charts. Each service's configuration, including the number of replicas and resource allocations per replica (CPU and memory), is provided for a comprehensive understanding of the setup.

## Test scenarios

### Concurrent CI executions

Concurrent CI executions are initiated with specific steps, including initializing Kubernetes pods, cloning repositories, and executing parallel steps with sleep intervals. These tests evaluate the platform's ability to handle high loads of CI executions efficiently.

### Concurrent CD executions

Concurrent CD executions involve fetching Docker artifacts from external repositories and executing sequential steps, including Canary deploy, Canary delete, Rolling deploy, and Kubernetes Delete. These tests focus on the platform's ability to orchestrate complex deployment workflows under heavy loads.

## Performance test reports

Harness publishes performance test reports with each release. Select a report below to view report details.

#### Test scenarios

##### >  1500 concurrent CI executions INLINE
Each CI pipeline:
- Initializes a Kubernetes pod and Git clone repo
- Runs 4 parallel steps (70 sec sleep)
- Runs template with 2 parallel steps (140sec sleep)

Projects: 1
Pipelines: 1500
Stages per pipeline: 1
Delegates: 10 (1cpu/2gi)

> Result: **PASS**
Total Execution Time: **6min**

##### >  1500 concurrent CI executions GitX
Each CI pipeline:
- Initializes a K8s pod and Git clone repo
- Runs 5 parallel steps (140 sec sleep) and echo statements

Projects: 1
Pipelines: 1500
Stages per pipeline: 1
Delegates: 10 (1cpu/2gi)

> Result: **PASS**
Total Execution Time: **4.2min**

##### >  500 concurrent CD executions INLINE
