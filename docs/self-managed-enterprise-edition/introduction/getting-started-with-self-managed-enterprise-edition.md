This document provides the basics on how to create a Harness account and first project. These are the first tasks that come after installing Self-Managed Enterprise Edition.

For links to information about using CI and CD pipelines, as well as the basics on Security Testing Orchestration (STO), see the last section of this documentation.

### Create your Harness account

You create your Harness account the first time you use Harness Self-Managed Enterprise Edition. You are automatically assigned the Harness user role, **Account Admin**.

### Create your first project

It takes time to learn how to create complex CI/CD pipelines. You can start with opening a project and inviting collaborators.

1. From the **Continuous Delivery** start page, click **Create Project**.
