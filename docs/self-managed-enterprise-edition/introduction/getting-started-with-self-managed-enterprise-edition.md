This topic provides the basics on how to create a Harness account and your first project. These are the first tasks that come after you install Harness Self-Managed Enterprise Edition.

For links to information about using CI and CD pipelines, as well as the basics on Security Testing Orchestration (STO), go to [Next steps](/docs/self-managed-enterprise-edition/introduction/getting-started-with-self-managed-enterprise-edition#next-steps).

### Create your Harness account

You create your Harness account the first time you use Harness Self-Managed Enterprise Edition. You are automatically assigned the Harness user role, **Account Admin**.

To create your Harness account, do the following:

1. On the Harness **Sign up** page, enter your email address and a secure password.

2. Select **Sign up**.

   After your account is created, you arrive at the **Continuous Delivery** start page.

### Create your first project

It takes time to learn how to create complex CI/CD pipelines. You can start with opening a project and inviting collaborators. 

To create a project, do the following:

1. From the **Continuous Delivery** start page, select **Create Project**.
