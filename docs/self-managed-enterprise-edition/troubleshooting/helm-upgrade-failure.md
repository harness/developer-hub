This topic provides solutions for upgrade problems related to Helm.

## MinIO password failure

Password failure happens when the current credentials are not used to authenticate. To avoid this problem, make sure you keep your old credentials after installation; they may be required to access data in persistent volume claims. You may encounter the following error.

:::info note
This error should not surface in charts 0.2.93 or newer.
:::

   ```
   UPGRADE FAILED: execution error at (harness-demo/charts/harness/charts/platform/charts/minio/templates/NOTES.txt:91:4): 
   PASSWORDS ERROR: You must provide your current passwords when upgrading the release.
                    Note that even after reinstallation, old credentials may be needed as they may be kept in persistent volume claims.

   ```

### Solutions

#### Set the root password

Specify the `auth.rootPassword` value. This field must not be empty.

To set the root password, do the following:

1. Use the following command to get the current value:

   ```
   export ROOT_PASSWORD=$(kubectl get secret --namespace "harness-test" minio -o jsonpath="{.data.root-password}" | base64 -d)
   ```

2. Add the following instruction to the command. 

   ```
   --set auth.rootPassword=$ROOT_PASSWORD
   ```

   For example:

   ```
   helm upgrade <chartname> <chartsource> -n <namespace> -f override.yaml --set harness.platform.minio.auth.rootPassword=$ROOT_PASSWORD
   ```
   
#### Update the oldvalues.yaml file

If you've already set the `auth.rootPassword` value one time, you can update and remove the `oldvalues.yaml` file.

To update and remove the file, do the following:

1. Use the following command to retrieve the file:

   ```
   helm get values <chartname> -n <namespace> > oldvalues.yaml
   ```

2. Edit the `oldvalues.yaml` file to include the new values. The file should include the encrypted MinIO password.

3. Upgrade the file:

   ```
   helm upgrade <chartname> <chartsource> -n <namespace> -f oldvalues.yaml
   ```

4. Delete the `oldvalues.yaml` file.
