You can back up and recover Self-Managed Enterprise Edition - Virtual Machine using [KOTS snapshots](https://kots.io/kotsadm/snapshots/overview/).

There are two types of snapshots:

* **Full snapshots:** a snapshot of all objects including setup data and applications.
	+ Full snapshots are useful in disaster recovery and rolling back to previous versions of Self-Managed Enterprise Edition - Virtual Machine.
	+ Full snapshots can restore fully or partially.
* **Partial snapshots:** a snapshot of application data only.
	+ Partial snapshots are useful for rolling back to previously installed versions of Self-Managed Enterprise Edition - Virtual Machine.

You can automate both types of snapshots.

## Requirements

- Automated backup and recovery is supported in versions 670XX and later of Self-Managed Enterprise Edition - Virtual Machine versions.

- Snapshots are stored in an AWS S3 bucket or AWS S3-compatible storage (Harness recommends either), or in Internal Storage.

   You will select and set up the storage option before creating a snapshot. This setup is described below.

Velero is installed and configured automatically in Self-Managed Enterprise Edition - Virtual Machine installations. You do not have to install it.

## Choose a storage destination

You have the following options for snapshot storage:

* AWS S3 bucket
* AWS S3-compatible storage
* Internal Storage

Harness recommends using an S3 bucket or S3-compatible storage to accommodate large files.

A Self-Managed Enterprise Edition - Virtual Machine **Production** installation has a minimum disk space requirement of 400G, so there should be enough space for Internal Storage. Still, Harness recommends an S3 bucket or S3-compatible storage to avoid any issues.

Storage destinations are described in the [KOTS documentation](https://kots.io/kotsadm/snapshots/storage-destinations/).

1. Log in to the Self-Managed Enterprise Edition - Virtual Machine KOTS admin tool.
2. Select **Snapshots**.
3. Select **Settings & Schedule**.
4. In **Storage**, select the storage method to use.

   In **Amazon S3** and **Other S3-Compatible Storage**, enter the location and credentials.  
   For details on these settings, see [Compatible Backend Stores](https://kots.io/kotsadm/snapshots/storage-destinations/) from KOTS.
5. Select **Update storage settings**. The settings are updated.

Now that you have storage for your snapshots, you can create the snapshots.

## Create full or partial snapshots

1. In the KOTS admin tool, click **Full Snapshots (Instance)** or **Partial Snapshots (Application)**.
2. Select **Start a snapshot**. The progress of the snapshot is shown on the screen:

3. Select the **more options** (**ï¸™**) button. The details of the snapshot appear.

Retain the snapshot for recovery operations.

## Automate snapshots

Scheduling snapshots is covered in the KOTS [Schedules](https://kots.io/kotsadm/snapshots/schedule/) documentation. Here is a summary of the steps:

1. To automate snapshots, click **Settings & Schedule**.
2. Select **Full snapshots** or **Partial snapshots**.
3. Select **Enable automatic scheduled snapshots**.
4. In **Schedule**, select the schedule for the snapshot.
5. In **Retention policy**, define how long to keep snapshots.

   The retention policy is described by KOTS:

      *The default retention period for snapshots is 1 month. Setting the retention only affects snapshots created after the time of the change. For example, if an existing snapshot had a retention of 1 year and is already 6 months old, and a user then uses the UI to change the retention to 1 month, the existing snapshot will still be around for another 6 months.*

6. Select **Update schedule**. The schedule is updated. To disable it, deselect **Enable automatic scheduled snapshots**.

## Restore from a full snapshot

You can perform a full or partial restore from a Full Snapshot. This is why KOTS recommends Full Snapshots.

1. Select **Full Snapshots (Instance)**.
2. Select the restore button.

   **Restore from backup** appears.
   
   ![](./static/virtual-machine-on-prem-backup-and-recovery-05.png)
   
3. Select **Full restore** or **Partial restore**.
4. For **Full restore**, do the following:
	a. Copy the provided command and run it on any master node. You might need to log into the admin tool again after the restore.
	b. Select **Ok, got it**.
5. For **Partial restore**, do the following:
	a. Enter the slug **harness**.
	b. Select **Confirm and restore**. You might need to log into the admin tool again after the restore.

## Restore from a partial snapshot

You can perform a partial restore using a Full or Partial Snapshot. The Full Snapshot steps are described above.

1. Select **Partial snapshots**.
2. Select the restore button.

   ![](./static/virtual-machine-on-prem-backup-and-recovery-06.png)
   
   **Restore from Partial backup (Application)** appears.
3. Enter the slug **harness**.
4. Select **Confirm and restore**. You might need to log into the admin tool again after the restore.
