Harness Self-Managed Enterprise Edition (SMP) provides organizations with full control over their software delivery infrastructure. This section explains how to set up SMP, including how to enable Resource Profiles and Modules. It also covers basic configuration steps, key components, and recommended best practices.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure the following requirements are met:

  * Kubernetes cluster (EKS, GKE, or AKS)
  * Helm 3.x installed
  * `kubectl` configured with access to your cluster
  * Valid Harness license keys (`NG` and `Looker`)

If you need assistance obtaining a license, please contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io).

## Configuration and Installation

:::note
  This section assumes that you have a running Kubernetes cluster, along with a configured Load Balancer IP or a DNS entry.
:::

The Harness Self-Managed Platform (SMP) is deployed using Helm charts, allowing you to customize the deployment through YAML override files. This section provides a minimal configuration to help you get started quickly. 

However, you can scale [resources](#resource-profiles) up or down based on your specific requirements. To begin the configuration and installation, follow the step-by-step instructions provided below.

1. Download the latest Helm chart from the [Harness GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/harness/helm-charts/releases?q=harness-0&expanded=true). Under the **Assets** section, locate and download the `harness-<release-version>.tgz` file.

2. Extract the Helm Chart, Untar the downloaded chart to a desired directory.

      ```bash
        tar -xzf harness-<release-version>.tgz -C <your-target-directory>
        cd <your-target-directory>/harness
      ```

3. Create a custom override file named `smp-demo-install.yaml`, and copy the YAML configuration provided below into it. You can further customize this file by updating additional configuration parameters available in the default `values.yaml` file included with the downloaded Helm chart.

    This file contains an extensive list of configurable options that enable additional features and fine-tune your Harness SMP deployment.

    ```yaml
      global:
        # -- Provide your URL for your intended load balancer
        loadbalancerURL: https://<XX.XX.XX.XX or DNS>
        # Enable Harness modules
        ng:
          enabled: true  # Enable Next Generation UI
        ci:
          enabled: true
        cd:
          enabled: true

        ingress:
          className: "harness"
          enabled: true
          # -- add global.ingress.ingressGatewayServiceUrl in hosts if global.ingress.ingressGatewayServiceUrl is not empty.
          hosts:
            - ''
          # -- set to ingress controller's k8s service FQDN for internal routing. eg "internal-nginx.default.svc.cluster.local"
          # If not set, internal request routing would happen via global.loadbalancerUrl
          ingressGatewayServiceUrl: "http://harness-ingress-controller"
          objects:
            # -- annotations to be added to ingress Objects
            annotations: {}
          tls:
            enabled: false
            secretName: harness-cert
    ```

4. Create a Kubernetes Namespace for SMP installation.

    ```bash
      kubectl create namespace harness-demo
    ```

5. Install the chart using your custom override file.

    ```bash
      helm install harness ./ -n harness-demo -f smp-demo-install.yaml
    ```  

6. Verify pods status.

    ```bash
      kubectl get pods -n harness-demo
    ```

7. If all steps above have been completed successfully and the services are running, you can access the Harness SMP UI at:

    ```bash
      http://<your-loadbalancer-ip>/auth/#/signup
    ```

## Module Enablement

Modules are functionalities of the Harness Platform, each designed for a specific use. In the Self-Managed Platform (SMP), you can control which modules are active by updating the YAML.

The platform module is the core of Harness and is always enabled â€” it cannot be turned off. Other modules, such as CI, CD, CCM, Chaos, etc. can be included or excluded by setting their values to `true` or `false` in the YAML file. 

  ```yaml
    global:
      platform:
        enabled: true  # Cannot be disabled
      # -- Enable to install Cloud Cost Management (CCM) 
      ccm:
        enabled: false
      # -- Enable to install Continuous Deployment (CD)
      cd:
        enabled: false
      # -- Enable to install First Generation Harness Platform (disabled by default)
      cg:
        enabled: false
      # -- Enable to install Chaos Engineering (CE) (Beta)
      chaos:
        enabled: false
      # -- Enable to install Continuous Integration (CI)
      ci:
        enabled: false
      # -- Enable to install Software Supply Chain Assurance (SSCA)
      ssca:
        enabled: false
      # -- Enable to install Database Devops (DB Devops)
      dbops:
        enabled: false
      # -- Enable to install Harness Code services (CODE)
      code:
        enabled: false
        # -- Enable to install Harness Infrastructure As Code Management (IACM)
      iacm:
        enabled: false
  ```

## Load Balancer

### Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)

These section will guide you through configuring AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) and Network Load Balancer (NLB) for Harness by overriding the YAML configuration file. 

This enables seamless routing of traffic to your Harness services while maintaining high availability and performance. 

:::tip
  ALB is recommended for HTTP/HTTPS traffic and provides advanced routing capabilities. NLB is recommended when you need extreme performance, static IPs, or handling of non-HTTP/HTTPS protocols
:::

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="ALB" label="AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB)" default>
   
  **Prerequisites**

  - EKS cluster with [AWS Load Balancer Controller installed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/aws-load-balancer-controller.html#lbc-overview)
  - `kubectl` access to your cluster
  - Helm 3.x installed

  **Installation Steps**

  1. Create Namespace

      ```bash
        kubectl create namespace harness-alb
      ```

                namespace: harness-alb
                annotations:
                  service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-type: "internal"
                  service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-scheme: "internet-facing"
                  service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-nlb-target-type: "ip"
              spec:
                type: LoadBalancer
                ports:
                  - port: 80
                    targetPort: 80
                    protocol: TCP
                    name: http
                  - port: 443
                    targetPort: 443
                    protocol: TCP
                    name: https
                selector:

          helm install harness <your-path>/harness/ \
            -n harness-alb \
            -f harness-alb-demo.yaml 
      ```

4. To retrieve the ALB DNS Name, Run the following command:

      ```bash
        kubectl get ingress -n harness-alb
      ```
> The value in the **ADDRESS** column is the DNS name of your Application Load Balancer (ALB).

5. Update the `harness-alb-demo.yaml` file with your ALB DNS name, then upgrade your Helm release.
  
      ```bash
        helm upgrade harness <your-path>/harness/ \
          -n harness-alb \
          -f harness-alb-demo.yaml

**Prerequisites**

- GKE cluster
- `kubectl` access to your cluster
- Helm 3.x installed
- Static IP address in GCP (optional but recommended)

**Installation**

1. Create Namespace

    ```bash
      kubectl create namespace harness-gcp 
    ```

2. [Download](https://github.com/harness/helm-charts/releases?q=harness-0&expanded=true) and Extract the Helm Chart, Untar the downloaded chart to a desired directory.

      ```bash
        tar -xzf harness-<release-version>.tgz -C <your-target-directory>

            loadBalancerEnabled: true
            useSelfSignedCert: false
            hosts:
              - ""

          # Enable NGINX
          nginx:
            create: true

          # Enable default backend
          defaultbackend:
            create: true
      ```

4. Install Harness

  ```bash
    helm install harness harness/ \
      -n harness-gcp  \
      -f harness-smp-gcp.yaml
  ```

5. To access Harness UI, navigate to `http://<YOUR-IP-ADDRESS-or-DNS>` in your browser.

## Licenses

A **license** defines the level of access and usage limits for using different features or modules of the platform, such as CI, CD, or Feature Flags. It determines what services are available, how many resources (like developers or pipelines) you can use, and for how long.

Harness Self-Managed Platform has two types of licenses:
  - Next Generation (NG).
  - Looker.

To enable the Core Platform and its modules on SMP, you need an `NG` license. To add analytics and reporting features, you'll also need a `Looker` license. Make sure to contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io) to obtain the required licenses.

#### NG License Configuration and Renewal 

To add or update your `NG` license, update in the `values.yaml` file.

```yaml
  global:
    license:
      ng: "your-ng-license-key"        
```

> Make sure to monitor the expiration date in the Harness UI and contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io) 30 days before expiration.

#### Looker License Configuration and Renewal 

To add or update your `looker` license, update in the `values.yaml` file.

   ```yaml  
      #Enable looker license in values.yaml
        looker:
          secrets:
            lookerLicenseKey: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
   ```

To Verify activation and more about Looker licensing, click [here](/docs/self-managed-enterprise-edition/advanced-configurations/configure-custom-dashboards#configuration).

## Resource Profiles 

This section outlines the resource requirements and the proper allocation of resources to ensure optimal performance and stability.

The resource profiles are designed to support different deployment scales and workloads, with predefined allocations for CPU, memory, and storage.

#### Available Resource Profiles

| **Profile** | **Concurrent Pipelines** | **Recommended Team Size** |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| **Small**   | Up to 50                 | Fewer than 50 users       |
| **Medium**  | Up to 200                | 50â€“200 users              |
| **Large**   | Over 200                 | 200+ users                |

#### Where to Find These Profiles

These resource profiles are available in the [Harness GitHub Helm chart](https://github.com/harness/helm-charts/releases?q=harness-0&expanded=true) once downloaded.

| **Profile Type** | **YAML File**          |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| Small            | `override-small.yaml`  |
| Medium           | `override-medium.yaml` |
| Large            | `override-large.yaml`  |
| Demo             | `override-demo.yaml`   |
| Production       | `override-prod.yaml`   |
| Performance      | `override-perf.yaml`   |

The standard `override-*.yaml` files are built for quick access and installation. You can further customize them based on your environment and use case.
  
### Installing Resource Profiles

To install SMP with your desired resource profile, you can either choose from our predefined profiles or create a custom resource configuration as described above.

To begin with the resource profile, first add the Harness Helm repository and update the repo index.

```bash
  # Add the Harness repository
    helm repo add harness https://harness.github.io/helm-charts
    helm repo update
```

1. Predefined Profiles

    ```bash
      # Install using medium profile
        helm install my-release harness/harness-prod -n <namespace> -f your-override.yaml -f override-medium.yaml
    ```

2. Custom Profiles

    - Create your resource override file (e.g., my-resources.yaml), and copy the sample YAML configuration provided below. 
        
        _Note: This is for reference onlyâ€”refer to `values.yaml` for the complete and accurate configuration._ 

      ```yaml
        platform:
          harness-manager:
            autoscaling:
              enabled: true
              minReplicas: 1
              maxReplicas: 2
              targetCPU: 80
              targetMemory: 80
            java:
              memory: "2048"
            replicaCount: 2
            resources:
              limits:
                memory: 4Gi

    - Apply your custom profile during installation:

      ```bash
          # Install with custom resources
            helm install my-release harness/harness-prod \
              -n <namespace> \
              -f your-override.yaml \
              -f my-resources.yaml
      ```

### Upgrading Resource Profiles

To update SMP with your desired resource allocations in an existing installation, use the following command.

```bash
  # Upgrade with new resource profile
  helm upgrade my-release harness/harness-prod \
    -n <namespace> \
    -f your-override.yaml \
    -f my-resources.yaml

  # Example with specific namespace
  helm upgrade harness harness/harness-prod \
    -n my-namespace-prod \
    -f values.yaml \
    -f new-resource-profile.yaml
```

## Feature Flags

Feature flags in Harness SMP allow you to enable, disable, or configure specific functionality across different components. This guide explains how to manage feature flags effectively in your deployment. 

To configure feature flags in SMP update your `values.yaml` with below parameters.

```yaml
platform:
  harness-manager:
    featureFlags:
      ADDITIONAL: "<YOUR_FEATURE_FLAGS>"
```

## Auto Scaling 

To configure autoscaling for Harness SMP components, update the parameters as shown below. This helps ensure efficient resource usage and optimal performance.

```yaml
global:
  autoscaling:
    enabled: true
```

To learn more about the HPA behavior, you can refer to its [Official Documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/#configurable-scaling-behavior)

## Pod Disruption Budgets (PDBs)

Pod Disruption Budgets (PDBs) ensure high availability of Harness SMP services during voluntary disruptions such as node maintenance, cluster upgrades, or scaling operations. This guide explains how to configure PDBs for different Harness components.

```yaml
global:
  # To enable PDB, set create to true
  pdb:
    create: false
```
