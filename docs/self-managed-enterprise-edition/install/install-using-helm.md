This document explains how to use Helm to install, upgrade, or uninstall Harness Self-Managed Enterprise Edition. This document describes an installation on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). The same installation process, however, applies to installations on Kubernetes versions 1.*x* and later.

Helm package manager provides a declarative approach to Kubernetes application management in which software packages are specified as "charts." For more information, go to the [Helm documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/).

## Helm client version compatibility

Harness validates Helm client compatibility against the following versions:

- 3.9.4
- 3.10.3
- 3.11.3
- 3.12.3
- 3.13.3
- 3.14.2

:::info note
You can also install Harness Self-Managed Enterprise Edition in an air-gapped environment. For more information, go to [Install in air-gapped environment](/docs/self-managed-enterprise-edition/install/install-in-an-air-gapped-environment).
:::

## Role requirements

The account you use to install Harness Self-Managed Enterprise Edition must have the Account Admin role to create service accounts. For more information on role-based permissions, go to [RBAC in Harness](/docs/platform/role-based-access-control/rbac-in-harness).

## Download the Harness Helm chart

To download the Harness Helm chart for the installation of Self-Managed Enterprise Edition, go to the [Harness Helm chart repo](https://github.com/harness/helm-charts/releases).

Harness Helm charts are available for demonstration and production environments.

## Update the override.yaml file

Helm chart values, default value definitions, and field descriptions are available in the [Harness Helm chart repo](https://github.com/harness/helm-charts#values).

Depending on your target environment, you'll need to update the `override.yaml` file to specify a load balancer or to specify the Harness modules to be deployed.

### Add a load balancer

You can use either Istio or Nginx as your ingress controller based on your specific technical requirements. Harness Self-Managed Enterprise Edition integrates with your chosen solution, providing enhanced traffic management, security, and streamlined DevOps workflows.

Use the following procedure to add a load balancer.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="NLB" label="NLB" default>

To add the URL for a load balancer, do the following:

1. In the `values.yaml` file, set the `global.loadbalancerURL` field to the URL of your load balancer. This is the URL you use for Harness.

   ```
   global:
    # -- Harness Application URL
    loadbalancerURL: http://<load-balancer-IP-address>
   ```

2. Set the `host_name` field to the IP address of the load balancer.

3. Save the file.

</TabItem>

<!---
<TabItem value="ELB" label="ELB">

</TabItem>

--->

<TabItem value="Ingress ALB" label="Ingress ALB">

To an ingress ALB, do the following:

1. Copy the following YAML, then save it to an `ingress-alb.yaml` file.

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
   kind: Ingress
   metadata:
     annotations:
       alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: HTTP
       alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/inbound-cidrs: 10.0.0.0/8
       alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/listen-ports: '[{"HTTP":80}]'
       alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/load-balancer-attributes: deletion_protection.enabled=false
       alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/scheme: internal
       alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-policy: ELBSecurityPolicy-TLS-1-2-Ext-2018-06
       alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/subnets: <subnets>
       alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/target-group-attributes: stickiness.enabled=true,stickiness.lb_cookie.duration_seconds=300
       alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/target-type: ip
       ingress.kubernetes.io/tls-minimum-version: "1.2"
     name: harness-public-ingress
     namespace: harness
   spec:
     ingressClassName: alb
     rules:
     - host: <YOUR_HOST_URL>
       http:
         paths:
         - backend:
             service:
               name: harness-ingress-controller
               port:
                 number: 80
           path: /
           pathType: Prefix
   ```
2. Replace `<YOU_HOST_URL>` with your load balancer's URL.

3. Replace `<YOUR_SUBNETS>` with your subnets.

   This sets traffic to internal only `alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/scheme: internal`.

4. Run the following command.

   ```
   kubectl apply -f ingress-alb.yaml -n <namespace>
   ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Optional: Configure a vanity URL based on your load balancer

You can use the script provided below to configure a vanity URL based on your load balancer. The script is available in the [Harness Helm chart](https://github.com/harness/helm-charts/blob/main/src/harness/configure-vality-url.sh) and also accessible at the following path within your Helm manifest: `harness/configure-vanity-url.sh`.

#### Prerequisites

Before using this script, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

- You must have a subdomain URL mapped to your load balancer's static IP. The subdomain URL must adhere to one of the following example formats:
  - `http://mysubdomain.mysite.com`
  - `https://mysubdomain.mysite.com`

#### Execution

Execute this script within your cluster environment, providing three argument inputs:

1. Namespace
2. Account ID
3. Subdomain URL

```
if [ "$#" -ne 3 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <namespace> <accountId> <subdomainUrl>"
    exit 1
fi

# Assign the first argument to namespace
namespace="$1"

# Assign the second argument to accountId
accountId="$2"

# Assign the second argument to subdomainUrl
subdomainUrl="$3"

MONGO_PASS=$(kubectl get secret -n $namespace mongodb-replicaset-chart -o jsonpath={.data.mongodb-root-password} | base64 --decode)
kubectl exec -it mongodb-replicaset-chart-0 -n $namespace -- mongo <<EOF
use admin
db.auth('admin', '${MONGO_PASS}')
use gateway
db.account_refs.update({"uuid":"${accountId}"},{\$set:{"subdomainUrl": "${subdomainUrl}"}})
db.account_refs.find()
use harness
db.accounts.update({"_id":"${accountId}"},{\$set:{"subdomainUrl": "${subdomainUrl}"}})
db.accounts.find()
EOF
kubectl patch configmap ng-auth-ui -n $namespace --type merge -p '{"data":{"EXPECTED_HOSTNAME":"app.harness.io"}}'
kubectl rollout restart -n $namespace deployment -l "app.kubernetes.io/name=ng-auth-ui"
```

##### Example command

The example command below executes the `configure-vanity-url.sh` script file for the `mynamespace` namespace, `abc123` account ID, and `http://smp.harnessurl.com` subdomain URL.

```
./configure-vanity-url.sh mynamespace abc123 http://smp.harnessurl.com
```

### Deploy Harness modules

Harness Helm chart includes Harness Platform components. You can add modules by editing the `override.yaml` file.

The Platform component and the module below is enabled by default:

* Harness Continuous Deployment (CD) - Next Generation

The Harness modules below can be enabled or disabled conditionally:

* Harness Chaos Engineering (CE)
* Harness Cloud Cost Management (CCM)
* Harness Continuous Integration (CI)
* Harness Security Testing Orchestration (STO)
* Harness Service Reliability Management (SRM)
* Harness Feature Flags (FF)
* (**Beta**) Harness Software Supply Chain Assurance (SSCA)

You can conditionally disable or enable the modules by specifying a boolean value in the `enabled` field of the YAML:

#### Deploy the CI module

```
ci:
# -- Enable to deploy CI to your cluster
enabled: true
```

#### Deploy the SRM module

```
srm:
# -- Enable to deploy SRM to your cluster
enabled: true
```

#### Deploy the FF module

```
ff:
# -- Enable to deploy FF to your cluster
enabled: true
```

#### Deploy the STO module

```
sto:
# -- Enable to deploy STO to your cluster
enabled: true
```

#### Deploy the CCM module

```
ccm:
# -- Enable to deploy Cloud Cost Management (CCM) to your cluster
enabled: true
```

#### Deploy the CE module

```
chaos:
# -- Enable to deploy Chaos Engineering (CE) to your cluster
enabled: true
```

#### Deploy the SSCA module

```
ssca:
# -- Enable to deploy SSCA to your cluster
enabled: true
```

### Add a Harness license

Harness Self-Managed Enterprise Edition needs a license to be provisioned for the Harness NextGen platform. Contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io) to procure the license and add it to the `override.yaml` file.
```
  license:
    # -- Insert CG License String to enable CG license
    cg: ''
    # -- Insert NG License String to enable NG license
    ng: ''
```

## Install the Helm chart

To use the charts, you must install Helm. To get started with Helm, go to the [Helm documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/). After you install Helm, follow the instructions below.

To install the Helm chart, do the following:

1. Add the repository.

   ```
   helm repo add harness https://harness.github.io/helm-charts
   ```

2. Create a namespace for your installation.

   ```
   kubectl create namespace <namespace>
   ```

3. Modify the `override.yaml` file with your environment settings.

4. Install the Helm chart.

   ```
   helm install my-release harness/harness -n <namespace> -f override.yaml
   ```

## Verify the installation

After the installation completes, the services that were installed are enumerated with their status.

![](./static/install-harness-self-managed-enterprise-edition-using-helm-ga-00.png)

The services that appear depend on the modules that were installed.

To verify installation, do the following:

1. Review the list of services.
2. In your browser, type the following instruction:

   ```
   http://localhost/auth/#/signup
   ```

   If the installation was successful, the Harness **Sign up** page appears.

## Helm chart values

For details about the chart values, explanations of the default values, and descriptions of the fields, go to [https://github.com/harness/helm-charts#values](https://github.com/harness/helm-charts#values).

## Use self-signed certificates with Helm-based installations

There are additional steps for self-signed certificates:

1. [Install delegates with custom certificates](/docs/platform/delegates/secure-delegates/install-delegates-with-custom-certs/)
2. [Configure a Kubernetes build farm to use self-signed certificates](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/set-up-build-infrastructure/k8s-build-infrastructure/configure-a-kubernetes-build-farm-to-use-self-signed-certificates/)
3. [Configure GitOps Agent with self-signed certificates](/docs/continuous-delivery/gitops/use-gitops/harness-git-ops-agent-with-self-signed-certificates/)

## Next steps

After installation is complete, you should create the initial Harness account, and then [create organizations and projects](../../platform/organizations-and-projects/create-an-organization.md).

To get started with the modules, review the following topics:

* For Harness Continuous Integration, go to the [CI key concepts](../../continuous-integration/get-started/key-concepts.md).
* For Harness Continuous Delivery & GitOps, go to the [CD key concepts](/docs/continuous-delivery/get-started/key-concepts.md).
* For Harness Security Testing Orchestration, go to the [STO overview](../../security-testing-orchestration/get-started/overview.md).
* For Harness Chaos Engineering, go to [Get started with Harness Chaos Engineering](/docs/category/get-started-with-hce).
* For Harness Cloud Cost Management, go to [Manage cloud costs by using Harness Self-Managed Enterprise Edition](/docs/category/ccm-on-harness-self-managed-enterprise-edition).
