### Terms of support

Harness Self-Managed Enterprise Edition does not introduce changes that break compatibility with supported versions of Kubernetes. For example, Self-Managed Enterprise Edition does not use features from Kubernetes version n that do not work in Kubernetes version n-2.

Installation and upgrade preflight checks provide warnings when you use unsupported Kubernetes versions.

In cases where you encounter a problem related to an incompatibility issue, you must upgrade your cluster. Harness does not issue a patch to accommodate the use of unsupported Kubernetes versions.
