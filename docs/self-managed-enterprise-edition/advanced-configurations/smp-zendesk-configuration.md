:::info Feature availability
This feature is available in Self-Managed Enterprise Edition 0.32.x and later. Admin access is required for "SMP Key Management" functionality.
:::

The Zendesk integration enables access to Harness support tickets from Self-Managed Platform without having to login separately from Harness SAAS. 

This integration requires generating a unique key pair where the private key remains secure on the local system while the public key is shared with Harness Support for account mapping and integration activation.

### Generate and register your SMP key

1. Navigate to **Account Settings** → **General** → **SMP Key Management**.

2. Click **Generate SMP key** to create a unique public key for your account.

3. Download the public key file and send it to [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io) for account mapping.

    :::note
    Harness does not have access to your private keys. Only the public key is shared with Harness Support to enable this functionality.
    :::

    :::info Important Note  
    To rotate your key (either as a security best practice or if it has been compromised), click **Rotate SMP Key** and confirm.  

    After rotation, you must send the new public key to Harness Support for remapping. Until the new key is mapped, the Zendesk integration will not work.  
    :::

4. Once enabled, access your tickets by navigating to **Help** → **View my tickets**.
