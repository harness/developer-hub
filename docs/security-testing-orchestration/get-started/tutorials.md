The following workflows and [tutorials](/tutorials/security-tests) are available. Harness recommends you do them in this order. 

  1. [Set up Harness for STO](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/get-started/onboarding-guide) describes how to set up the connectors, delegate, and build infrastructure that you need to run an STO pipeline. Then it guides you through the process of setting up a simple standalone STO pipeline. This is a good guide if you're totally new to Harness.  
   
  2. [Your first STO pipeline](/tutorials/security-tests/learn-about-sto/your-first-sto-pipeline) This tutorial covers the basic concepts of STO. You'll set up a standalone pipeline with one scanner, run scans, analyze the results, and learn how to investigate and fix detected vulnerabilities. You'll also learn how to  configure a scan step to fail the pipeline if the scan finds any "show-stopper" vulnerabilities. 

  3. [Quickstarts](/tutorials/security-tests/quickstarts/) These tutorials focus on setting up a pipeline and open-source scanner quickly for specific target types. These tutorials assume that you're already familiar with basic STO concepts covered in [Your first STO pipeline](/tutorials/security-tests/learn-about-sto/your-first-sto-pipeline).
