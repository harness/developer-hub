This topic discusses the following STO topics:
- [Targets](#targets)
- [Variants](#variants)
- [Baselines](#baselines)
- [Where was an issue detected: in the variant, in the baseline, or both?](#where-was-an-issue-detected-in-the-variant-in-the-baseline-or-both)
- [Why you should define a baseline for every STO target](#why-you-should-define-a-baseline-for-every-sto-target)


### Targets

### Variants


import StoConceptVariants from '/docs/security-testing-orchestration/get-started/shared/_variants.md';


<StoConceptVariants />

### Baselines


import StoConceptBaselines from '/docs/security-testing-orchestration/get-started/shared/_baselines.md';


<StoConceptBaselines />

### Where was an issue detected: in the variant, in the baseline, or both? 

Every STO pipeline execution has a [Security Tests tab](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/use-sto/view-and-troubleshoot-vulnerabilities/view-scan-results) with separate lists of issues that make it easy to determine where and when a specific issue was detected:

- Only in the current scan of the selected variant
- Also in previous scans of the selected variant
- Also in previous scans of the baseline
