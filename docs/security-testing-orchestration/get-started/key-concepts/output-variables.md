To view the output variables for a scan, go to the Pipeline Execution page, select the scan step, and click **Output**.

:::note
If a scan step fails because the [Fail on Severity](./fail-pipelines-by-severity.md) threshold was reached, the build results do not include any output variables.

For information about how severity levels are calculated, go to [Severities](./severities.md).
