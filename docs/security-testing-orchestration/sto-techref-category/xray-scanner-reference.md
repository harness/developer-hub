You can ingest scan results from JFrog Xray, a software composition analyis (SCA) solution that integrates with Artifactory and identifies vulnerabilities in open-source libraries and packages used in your code.

The standard workflow is to create a CI Build or Security Tests stage to your pipeline, add a Security step, and then use `setting:value` pairs to configure the step as specified below.



## Important notes for running Xray scans in STO

- Harness STO supports `ingestionOnly` scans with Jfrog Xray. `orchestrationOnly` and `dataLoad` scans are not supported. 

- For information about running Xray scans with custom SSL certificates, go to [Authenticating with RSA Keys](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-cli/authenticating-with-rsa-keys) in the JFrog documentation.

- If you need to add trusted certificates to your scan images at runtime, you need to run the scan step with root access. 

  You can set up your STO scan images and pipelines to run scans as non-root and establish trust for your own proxies using self-signed certificates. For more information, go to [Configure STO to Download Images from a Private Registry](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/use-sto/set-up-sto-pipelines/download-images-from-private-registry).
