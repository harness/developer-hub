Every STO scan step has a **Fail on Severity** setting. If the scan finds any vulnerability with the specified [severity level](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/get-started/key-concepts/severities) or higher, the pipeline fails automatically. You can specify one of the following:
* **`CRITICAL`**
* **`HIGH`**
* **`MEDIUM`**
* **`LOW`**
* **`INFO`**
* **`NONE`** â€” Do not fail on severity

The YAML definition looks like this: `fail_on_severity : critical # | high | medium | low | info | none`
