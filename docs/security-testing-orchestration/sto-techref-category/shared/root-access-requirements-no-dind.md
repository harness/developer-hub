If you want to add trusted certificates to your scan images at runtime, you need to run the scan step with root access. 

You can utilize custom STO scan images and pipelines to run scans as a non-root user. For more details, refer [Configure your pipeline to use STO images from private registry](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/use-sto/set-up-sto-pipelines/configure-pipeline-to-use-sto-images-from-private-registry).
