If you want to add trusted certificates to your scan images at runtime, you need to run the scan step with root access. 

You can set up your STO scan images and pipelines to run scans as non-root and establish trust for your proxies using custom certificates. For more information, go to [Configure STO to Download Images from a Private Registry](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/use-sto/set-up-sto-pipelines/download-images-from-private-registry).
