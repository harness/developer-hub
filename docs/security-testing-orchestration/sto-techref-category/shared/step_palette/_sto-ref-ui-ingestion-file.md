The results data file to use when running an Ingestion scan. STO steps can ingest scan data in [SARIF](https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0/sarif-v2.1.0.html) and [Harness Custom JSON](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/use-sto/orchestrate-and-ingest/ingesting-issues-from-other-scanners) format. Generally an Ingestion scan consists of a scan step (to generate the data file) and an ingestion step (to ingest the data file).
