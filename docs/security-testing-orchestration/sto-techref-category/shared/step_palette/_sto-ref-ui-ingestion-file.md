The results data file to use when running an Ingestion scan. 
 
Generally an Ingestion scan consists of a scan step (to generate the data file) and an ingestion step (to ingest the data file).

In addition to ingesting scan data in the external scanner's native format, STO steps can also ingest  data in [SARIF](https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0/sarif-v2.1.0.html) and [Harness Custom JSON](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/use-sto/orchestrate-and-ingest/ingesting-issues-from-other-scanners) format.
