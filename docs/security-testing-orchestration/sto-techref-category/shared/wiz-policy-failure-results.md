The Wiz policy failure results appears in the scan results as an `Info` level issue, categorized as `External Policy` Issue Type. Additionally, you can apply an OPA policy to fail the pipeline based on the policy failures. This can be achieved using the [Security Tests - External Policy Failures](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/policies/create-opa-policies.md#block-the-pipeline-based-on-external-policy-failures) policy from the [security tests policy samples](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/policies/create-opa-policies.md#security-test-policy-samples).
