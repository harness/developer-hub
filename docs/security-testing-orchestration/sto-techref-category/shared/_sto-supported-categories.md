The following list shows the scan types that STO supports:

* **SAST (Static Application Security Testing)** scans a code repository and identifies known vulnerabilities in open-source and proprietary code.
* **SCA (Software Composition Analysis)** scans a code repository and identifies known vulnerabilities in open-source libraries and packages used by the code. 
* **DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)** scans a running application for vulnerabilties by simulating a malicious external actor exploiting known vulnerabilties. 
* **Container Scanning** identifies vulnerabilities in container images.
