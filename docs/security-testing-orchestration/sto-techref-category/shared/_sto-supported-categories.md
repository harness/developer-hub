The following list shows the scan types that STO supports:

* **SAST (_Static Application Security Testing_)** scans a code repository and identifies known vulnerabilities in the proprietary code.
* **SCA (Software Composition Analysis)** scans a code repository and identifies known vulnerabilities in open-source libraries and packages used by the code. 
* **DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)** scans a running application for vulnerabilties by simulating a malicious external actor exploiting known vulnerabilties. 
* **Container Scanning** identifies known vulnerabilities in a Docker container.
