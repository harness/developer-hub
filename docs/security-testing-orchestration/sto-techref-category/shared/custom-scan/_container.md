A registry that uses the Docker Registry v2 API such as [Docker Hub](https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/api/), [Google Container Registry](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry), or [Google Artifact Registry](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry).
```
docker_v2
```

[JFrog Docker Registry](https://jfrog.com/container-registry/).
```
jfrog_artifactory

[Amazon Container Registry](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/).
```
aws_ecr
```

```
