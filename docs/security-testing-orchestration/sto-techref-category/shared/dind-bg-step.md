:::note 

Docker-in-Docker is not required for ingestion workflows where the scan data has already been generated.

:::

You need to include a Docker-in-Docker background service in your stage if either of these conditions apply:
* You configured your scanner using a generic Security step rather than a scanner-specific template such as Aqua Trivy, Bandit, Mend, Snyk, etc. 
* Youâ€™re scanning a container image using an Orchestration or Extraction workflow. 

<details><summary>Set up a Docker-in-Docker background step</summary>

1. Go to the stage where you want to run the scan.

2. In **Overview**, add the shared path `/var/run`.

2. In **Execution**, do the following:

    1. Click **Add Step** and then choose **Background**.
    2. Configure the Background step as follows:
       1. Dependency Name = `dind`
       2. Container Registry = The Docker connector to download the DinD image. If you don't have one defined, go to [Docker connector settings reference](/docs/platform/connectors/cloud-providers/ref-cloud-providers/docker-registry-connector-settings-reference).
       3. Image = `docker:dind`
       4. Under **Entry Point**, add the following: `dockerd` 
          
          Harness recommends using `dockerd` as a faster and more secure way to set up the background step. For more information, go to the **TLS** section in the [Docker quick reference](https://hub.docker.com/_/docker).

       5. Under **Optional Configuration**, select the **Privileged** checkbox.
