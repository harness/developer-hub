This workflow describes how to ingest Snyk scan results into a Harness pipeline. STO supports the following scan approaches for the following Snyk products:

- Snyk Open Source ([orchestratedScan](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/use-sto/orchestrate-and-ingest/run-an-orchestrated-scan-in-sto.md), [ingestionOnly](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/use-sto/orchestrate-and-ingest/ingest-scan-results-into-an-sto-pipeline.md))
- Snyk Code ([ingestionOnly](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/use-sto/orchestrate-and-ingest/ingest-scan-results-into-an-sto-pipeline.md))
- Snyk Container ([ingestionOnly](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/use-sto/orchestrate-and-ingest/ingest-scan-results-into-an-sto-pipeline.md))
- Snyk infrastructure as Code — ([ingestionOnly](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/use-sto/orchestrate-and-ingest/ingest-scan-results-into-an-sto-pipeline.md)) is in BETA

## Important notes for running Snyk scans in STO

- Snyk Code and Snyk Container scans require a [Snyk API key](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-api-info/authentication-for-api). You should create a [Harness secret](/docs/platform/secrets/secrets-management/secrets-and-log-sanitization) for your API key.

- For an overview of recommended Snyk workflows, go to [CI/CD adoption and deployment](https://docs.snyk.io/integrations/snyk-ci-cd-integrations/snyk-ci-cd-integration-deployment-and-strategies/ci-cd-adoption-and-deployment) in the Snyk documentation.

- Snyk recommends running [`snyk monitor`](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli/commands/monitor) with container images.

- If you're scanning a code repository, note the following:

  - In some cases, you need to build a project before scanning. You can do this in a Run step in your Harness pipeline.

    For specific requirements, go to [Setup requirements for AWS CodePipeline](https://docs.snyk.io/integrations/ci-cd-integrations/aws-codepipeline-integration/setup-requirements-for-aws-codepipeline) in the Snyk documentation. These requirements are applicable to Harness pipelines as well as AWS CodePipeline.

  - Harness recommends that you use [language-specific Snyk container images](https://hub.docker.com/r/snyk/snyk) to run your scans.

  - For complete end-to-end examples, go to:
    - [Scan a repository: orchestration example](#scan-a-repository-orchestration-example)
    - [Scan a repository: ingestion example](#scan-a-repository-ingestion-example)

- If you're scanning a container image, note the following:

  - Container image scans require Docker-in-Docker running in Privileged mode as a background service.

  - For a complete end-to-end example, go to [Scan a container image: workflow example](#scan-a-container-image-workflow-example) below.

## Snyk repository orchestration example

This example uses a Snyk step in Orchestration mode to scan a repository. This is the simplest workflow: the Snyk step runs the scan and ingests the results, with minimal configuration required.

<!-- TBD What Snyk CLI command does the orchestration step use?  -->

![](../static/snyk-scans-pipeline-orchestration-00.png)

1. Add a [codebase connector](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/codebase-configuration/create-and-configure-a-codebase/) that points to the repository you want to scan.

2. Add a Security Tests or Build stage to your pipeline.

<!-- commenting out this step, doesn't look like it's necessary for orchestration scans

3. Go to the Overview tab of the stage. Under **Shared Paths**, enter the following path: `/shared/customer_artifacts`

-->

3. Add a [Snyk security step](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/sto-techref-category/snyk/snyk-scanner-reference) to ingest the results of the scan. In this example, the step is configured as follows:

   1. Scan Mode = **Orchestration**
   2. Target Type = **Repository**
   3. Target Name = (_user-defined_)
   <!-- Variant = [**`<+codebase.branch>`**](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/codebase-configuration/built-in-cie-codebase-variables-reference/#codebasebranch) (_runtime expression_) -->
   4. Variant = (_user-defined_)
   5. Access Token = [**`<+secrets.getValue("snyk_api_token")>`**](/docs/platform/secrets/secrets-management/secrets-and-log-sanitization) (_Harness secret_)

4. Apply your changes, then save and run the pipeline.

## Snyk repository ingestion example

The following example uses [`snyk test`](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli/commands/test) to scan a .NET repository.

The scan stage in this pipeline has the following steps:

- A Run step installs the build; then it scans the image and saves the output to a shared folder.

- A Snyk step then ingests the output file.

![](../static/snyk-scans-pipeline-00.png)

1. Add a [codebase connector](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/codebase-configuration/create-and-configure-a-codebase/) to your pipeline that points to the repository you want to scan.

2. Add a Security Tests or Build stage to your pipeline.

3. Go to the **Overview** tab of the stage. Under **Shared Paths**, enter the following path: `/shared/customer_artifacts`.

4. Add a **Run** step that runs the build (if required), scans the repo, and saves the results to the shared folder:

   1. In the Run step **Command** field, add code to build a local image (if required) and save the scan results to the shared folder.

      In this example, we want to scan a .NET repository. The [setup requirements](https://docs.snyk.io/integrations/snyk-ci-cd-integrations/aws-codepipeline-integration/setup-requirements-for-aws-codepipeline) topic says: _Build only required if no packages.config file present._ The repo does not contain this file. Enter the following code in the **Command** field:

      ```bash
      # populates the dotnet dependencies
      dotnet restore SubSolution.sln

      # scan the code repository
      snyk code test \
         --file=SubSolution.sln  \
         --sarif-file-output=/shared/customer_artifacts/snyk_scan_results.sarif || true
      ```

   2. For the Run step **Image**, use a [supported Snyk image](https://github.com/snyk/snyk-images#current-images) based on the type of code in your codebase.

   3. In the Run step **Environment Variables** field, under **Optional Configuration**, add a variable to access your Snyk API key:

      `SNYK_TOKEN` = [**`<+secrets.getValue("snyk_api_token")>`**](/docs/platform/secrets/secrets-management/secrets-and-log-sanitization)`

      Your Run step should now look like this:

      ![](../static/snyk-scans-run-step-01.png)

   4. In the Run step > **Advanced** tab > **Failure Strategies**, set the Failure Strategy to **Mark as Success**.

      This step is required to ensure that the pipeline proceeds if Snyk finds a vulnerability. Otherwise, the build will exit with an error code before STO can ingest the data.

5. Add a [Snyk security step](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/sto-techref-category/snyk/snyk-scanner-reference) to ingest the results of the scan. In this example, the step is configured as follows:

   1. Scan Mode = **Ingestion**
   2. Target Type = **Repository**
   3. Target Name = (_user-defined_)
   <!-- Variant = [**`<+codebase.branch>`**](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/codebase-configuration/built-in-cie-codebase-variables-reference/#codebasebranch) (_runtime expression_) -->
   4. Variant = (_user-defined_)
   5. Ingestion = **`/shared/customer_artifacts/snyk_scan_results.sarif`**

6. Apply your changes, then save and run the pipeline.

## Snyk container image ingestion example

This example uses [`snyk container test`](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli/commands/container-test) to scan a container image. The scan stage consists of three steps:

- A Background step that runs Docker-in-Docker as a background service in Privileged mode (required when scanning a container image).

- A Run step that scans the image and publishes the results to a SARIF file.

- A Snyk step that ingests the scan results.

![](../static/snyk-scans-image-pipeline-03.png)

1. Add a Security Tests or Build stage to your pipeline.

2. Add a **Background** step to the stage and set it up as follows:

   1. Dependency Name = `dind`
   2. Container Registry = The Docker connector to download the DinD image. If you don't have one defined, go to [Docker connector settings reference](/docs/platform/Connectors/Cloud-providers/ref-cloud-providers/docker-registry-connector-settings-reference).
   3. Image = `docker:dind`
   4. Under **Optional Configuration**, select the **Privileged** option.

3. Add a **Run** step and set it up as follows:

   1. Container Registry = Select a Docker Hub connector.
   2. Image = `snyk/snyk:docker`
   3. Shell = **Sh**
   4. Command — Enter code to run the scan and save the results to SARIF:

      ```bash
      snyk container test \
          snykgoof/big-goof-1g:100 -d \
          --sarif-file-output=/shared/customer_artifacts/snyk_container_scan.sarif  || true
      ```

      Snyk maintains a set of [snykgoof](https://hub.docker.com/u/snykgoof) repositories that you can use for testing your container-image scanning workflows.

   5. Under **Optional Configuration**, select the **Privileged** option.

   6. Under **Environment Variables**, add a variable for your Snyk API token. Make sure that you save your token to a [Harness secret](/docs/platform/secrets/add-use-text-secrets/):

      SNYK_TOKEN = [**`<+secrets.getValue("snyk_api_token")>`**](/docs/platform/secrets/secrets-management/secrets-and-log-sanitization)

   7. In the Run step > **Advanced** tab > **Failure Strategies**, set the Failure Strategy to **Mark as Success**.

      This step is required to ensure that the pipeline proceeds if Snyk finds a vulnerability. Otherwise, the build will exit with an error code before STO can ingest the data.

4. Add a [Snyk step](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/sto-techref-category/snyk/snyk-scanner-reference) and configure it as follows:

   1. Scan Mode = **Ingestion**
   2. Target Type = **Container Image**
   3. Target Name = (_user-defined_)
   <!-- Variant = [**`<+codebase.branch>`**](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/codebase-configuration/built-in-cie-codebase-variables-reference/#codebasebranch) (_runtime expression_) -->
   4. Variant = (_user-defined_)
   5. Ingestion = **`/shared/customer_artifacts/snyk_container_scan.sarif`**

5. Apply your changes, then save and run the pipeline.

## Snyk Infrastructure as Code (IaC) repository ingestion example

:::note

Support for Snyk scans of IaC repositories is a beta feature. For more information, contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io).

:::

The following example uses [`snyk iac test`](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli/commands/iac-test) to scan a an IaC code repository.

The scan stage in this pipeline has the following steps:

- A Run step installs the build; then it scans the image and saves the output to a shared folder.

- A Snyk step then ingests the output file.

![](../static/snyk-scans-iac-00.png)

1. Add a [codebase connector](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/codebase-configuration/create-and-configure-a-codebase/) to your pipeline that points to the repository you want to scan.

2. Add a Security Tests or Build stage to your pipeline.

3. Go to the Overview tab of the stage. Under **Shared Paths**, enter the following path: `/shared/customer_artifacts`

4. Add a **Run** step that runs the build (if required), scans the repo, and saves the results to the shared folder:

   1. In the Run step **Command** field, add code to run the scan and save the scan results to the shared folder.

      ```bash
      snyk iac test --sarif --sarif-file-output=/shared/customer_artifacts/snyk_iac.json /harness || true
      cat /shared/customer_artifacts/snyk_iac.json
      ```

   2. For the Run step **Image**, use a [supported Snyk image](https://github.com/snyk/snyk-images#current-images) based on the type of code in your codebase.

   3. In the Run step **Environment Variables** field, under **Optional Configuration**, add a variable to access your Snyk API key:

      `SNYK_TOKEN` = [**`<+secrets.getValue("snyk_api_token")>`**](/docs/platform/secrets/secrets-management/secrets-and-log-sanitization)`

      Your Run step should now look like this:

      ![](../static/snyk-scans-iac-run-step-01.png)

   4. In the Run step > **Advanced** tab > **Failure Strategies**, set the Failure Strategy to **Mark as Success**.

      This step is required to ensure that the pipeline proceeds if Snyk finds a vulnerability. Otherwise, the build will exit with an error code before STO can ingest the data.

5. Add a [Snyk security step](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/sto-techref-category/snyk/snyk-scanner-reference) to ingest the results of the scan. In this example, the step is configured as follows:

   1. Scan Mode = **Ingestion**
   2. Target Type = **Repository**

   <!-- Variant = [**`<+codebase.branch>`**](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/codebase-configuration/built-in-cie-codebase-variables-reference/#codebasebranch) (_runtime expression_) -->
   4. Variant = (_user-defined_)
   5. Ingestion = **`/shared/customer_artifacts/snyk_iac.sarif`**

6. Apply your changes, then save and run the pipeline.
