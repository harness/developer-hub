title: Configure STO to Download Images from a Private Registry
description: You can set up STO to download your scanner images from a private registry instead of Docker Hub.

Harness maintains its own set of scan images for [STO-supported scanners](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/sto-techref-category/security-step-settings-reference.md#scanners-target-types-and-scan-approach). By default, a Harness pipeline build pulls scan images from Docker Hub.

This topic describes how to override the default behavior and use a private registry instead. You can download the scan images you need, perform your own security checks on the images, upload them to a private registry, and then set up your STO steps to download images from this registry. 

### Create STO scanner images with your own SSL certificates (_optional_)

Harness STO supports [three workflows](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/use-sto/set-up-sto-pipelines/add-custom-certs/ssl-setup-in-sto#supported-workflows-for-adding-custom-ssl-certificates) for running scans with custom certificates.

In this workflow, you set up your STO scan images and pipelines to run scans as non-root and establish trust for your own proxies using self-signed certificates. This workflow supports any STO-compatible scanner that can run natively without root access. This workflow also supports build environments that use a self-signed proxy server between the Harness Delegate and Harness Manager.

:::note
Running container image scans as a non-root user is not currently supported.
:::

1. Save a copy of the following Dockerfile into a folder along with the certificates you want to copy to the image.

2. Update the `FROM`, `COPY`, and `USER` commands as described in the Dockerfile comments.

3. Build the new image and then publish it to your private registry.

4. Update the scan step in your pipeline as follows:

   1. Update the **Image** setting to point to the new image in your registry.
   2. If you specified a `USER` in your Dockerfile, set the **Run as User** (`runAsUser`) setting to the user you specified in your Dockerfile.

<details><summary>Dockerfile template for adding certificates to an STO scanner image</summary>

``` bash
# STEP 1 
# Specify the STO scanner image where you want to add your certificates
# For a list of all images in the Harness Container Registry, run the following:
#     curl -X  GET https://app.harness.io/registry/_catalog
FROM harness/twistlock-job-runner:latest as scanner

# FYI Root access is required to load and trust certificates
USER root

# STEP 2 
# Copy your certificates to the engine
# You can copy multiple ca from completely different paths into SHARE_CA_PATH
COPY ./CERTIFICATE_1.pem ../another-folder/CERTIFICATE_2.pem /shared/customer_artifacts/certificates/


# FYI establishes trust for certificates in Python and the OS 
RUN sto_plugin --trust-certs
# Optional: To trust certificates for Java for tools such as
# - Black Duck Hub
# - Checkmarx
# - Sonarqube
# - Veracode
# - NexusIQ
# RUN sh /bin/setup.sh 

# STEP 3 (optional)
# Create a user and assume limited permission user
# If you set this, you need to add runAsUser setting in the scan step
#     i.e., runAsUser: "1000"
USER 1000

```

### Workflow description

1. Download the scan images you need, test and validate the images, and store them in your private registry. 

   :::note
   
   Do not change the image names in your private registry. The image names must match the names specified by Harness.

   :::

   Harness maintains a Container Image Registry that is dedicated exclusively to hosting Harness-supported images. You can download your scan images from this registry instead of Docker Hub. To view the list of images in this registry, enter the following command:
   ```
   curl -X  GET https://app.harness.io/registry/_catalog
   ```
   You can also [set up your CI pipelines](/docs/platform/Connectors/Artifact-Repositories/connect-to-harness-container-image-registry-using-docker-connector) to download build images from this registry instead of Docker Hub.

2. For each Security Scan step, add these settings:

   * `runner_registry_domain`  —  The URL of the Docker registry where the images are stored. 
     
     The supported format is `<_domain_>/<_directory_>` (such as, `app.harness.io/registry`). 
     
     Do not include the scheme (such as `http://` or `https://`).

   * `runner_registry_image_prefix : harness` — Do not change this setting. 

   * `runner_registry_username`  — As needed

   * `runner_registry_token`  — As needed

   If you need to use a proxy server, you must also specify the following: 

   * `http_proxy`  —  The hostname and port to use for proxied HTTP requests
  
   * `https_proxy`  —  The hostname and port to use for proxied HTTPS requests

   * `no_proxy`  — A comma-separated list of hosts to bypass the proxy


### YAML example

The following pipeline downloads its Security Scan image (bandit) and all of its CI build images from the Harness Image Registry.
