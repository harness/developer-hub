Harness uses state-of-the-art AI technology to streamline the process of triaging and fixing security vulnerabilities. For every vulnerability findings by the scanner and ingested into STO, Harness AI explains the issue precisely and provides detailed advice additional to the remediation suggestion provided by the scanner itself — including code changes and package upgrades — on how to fix it. It is based on large, well-trained language models. Optionally, you can regenerate advice with additional context and thereby optimize your results.

Harness AI reduces developer toil by streamlining and simplifying the process of fixing vulnerabilities. It enables developers and security personnel to manage security-issue backlogs and address critical issues promptly. It can help you create code suggestions and pull requests to remediate the issue right from STO. It can dramatically reduce your TTR, speed up your software delivery lifecycle, and improve the security posture of your applications and services.
