Harness AI Development Assistant (AIDA) uses state-of-the-art AI technology to streamline the process of triaging and fixing security vulnerabilities. For every vulnerability detected by STO, Harness AIDA explains the issue precisely and provides detailed advice  — including code changes and package upgrades — on how to fix it. Harness AIDA is based on large, well-trained language models. It learns continuously based on feedback and the latest public knowledge. Optionally, you can regenerate advice with additional context and thereby optimize your results. 

Harness AIDA reduces developer toil by streamlining and simplifying the process of fixing vulnerabilities. It enables developers and security personnel to manage security-issue backlogs and address critical issues promptly. Harness AIDA can dramatically reduce your TTR, speed up your software development lifecycle, and improve the security posture of your applications and services.
