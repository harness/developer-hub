* Before you can use Harness AIDA, you must do the following:
  1. Read the [AIDA Data Privacy Overview](https://www.harness.io/legal/aida-privacy).
  2. Sign an [End-User License Agreement](https://www.harness.io/legal/aida-terms) with Harness
  3. Enable AIDA in your Harness account. Go to **Account Settings**, select **Account Resources**, select the **Harness AIDA** tile, and then enable the **Harness AI Development Assistant (AIDA)** setting. Select **Allow Overrides** if you want to be able to enable/disable AIDA for individual projects.  

* Before you implement an AI-generated suggestion, consider carefully the reliability and extent of the publicly-known information about that issue. The accuracy, reliability, and completeness of a suggestion depends on the publicly-known information about the detected issue. An AI-generated suggestion is not guaranteed to remediate the issue and could possibly introduce other issues.

* You should also consider the suggestion's applicability to your specific target and use case. An issue might have no known remediation, especially if it was recently discovered. An issue might have multiple suggested remediations that are contradictory or applicable only to specific use cases.

* A specific remediation might involve installing components with usage and license requirements. Check any requirements in advance.

* The workflow description below shows how you can refine a suggestion by providing more information, such as additional context or code snippets, to Harness AIDA.
