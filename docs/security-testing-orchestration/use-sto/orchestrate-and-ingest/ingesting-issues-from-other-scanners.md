You can ingest custom issues from any scanning tool. STO supports a generic JSON format for ingesting data from unsupported scanners that cannot publish to SARIF.

### Important notes for importing data from unsupported scanners into STO

- This workflow is intended for scanners that have no supported integration in STO. Harness recommends that you always use the documented workflow for supported scanners. For a list of all STO-supported scanners, go to [What's supported](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/whats-supported) and click **Harness STO scanner support** to expand.

- [SARIF](https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0/sarif-v2.1.0.html) is an open data format supported by many scan tools. If your scanner supports this format, publish your results to SARIF. For more information, go to [Ingest SARIF results](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/use-sto/orchestrate-and-ingest/ingest-sarif-data).

- For STO to ingest your scan results, the ingestion file must match the [JSON format](#json-data-format-reference) specified below.

### Required steps to ingest data from unsupported scanners into STO

1. In your Harness pipeline, go to the Overview tab of the security stage and enter a shared path such as `/shared/customer_artifacts`.
 
   ![](../static/ingesting-issues-from-other-scanners-00.png)

2. Generate your issues data in the [required JSON format](#jaon-data-format-reference) described below and then save it in the shared folder.  
  You might want to set up a Run step to generate your scans automatically whenever the pipeline runs. Go to [Ingest Scan Results into an STO Pipeline](ingest-scan-results-into-an-sto-pipeline.md) for an example.

3. Add a **Custom Ingest** step and configure the scanner to ingest the results of the scan. For information about how to configure this step, go to [Custom Ingest settings reference](docs/security-testing-orchestration/sto-techref-category/custom-ingest-reference.md).


###  JSON data format reference

The following example illustrates the required format for your data:

```yaml
{  
   "meta":{  
      "key":[  
         "issueName",  
         "fileName"  
      ],  
      "subproduct":"MyCustomScanner"  
   },  
   "issues":[  
      {  
         "subproduct":"MyCustomScanTool",  
         "issueName":"Cross Site Scripting",  
         "issueDescription":"Lorem ipsum...",  
         "fileName":"homepage-jobs.php",  
         "remediationSteps":"Fix me fast.",  
         "risk":"high",  
         "severity":8,  
         "status":"open",  
         "referenceIdentifiers":[  
            {  
               "type":"cwe",  
               "id":"79"  
            }  
         ]  
      }  
   ]  
}
```

The basic schema includes a `“meta”` section, which requires the following: 

* `“key”`

   The name of the attribute used to deduplicate multiple occurrences of an issue. In the example data file above, `"key"` = `"issueName"`. Thus if the data includes multiple occurrences of an issue with the same `"issueName"`, the pipeline combines these occurrences into one issue. The resulting issue includes a list of all occurrences and the data for each individual occurrence.
   
   The key used for deduplication must be a Harness field. Do not try to deduplicate based on non-Harness fields. 

* `“subproduct”` 

   The scan tool name to apply to the overall issue. 
   
The full JSON takes the form:


```json
"meta":   
     { ... },   
     "issues": [   
        { "issue-1" : "data" },   
        { "issue-2" : "data" },  
        { "issue-3" : "data" }  
}
```

##### Custom fields for Harness STO JSON schema

You can add custom fields to an issue. The only restriction is that you cannot use any of the [reserved keywords](#reserved-keywords) listed above. To include raw, unrefined data, add the prefix "`_raw`" to the field name. For example, you can add the following "`_raw`" fields to an issue:


```
{  
   "testName":"hardcode_tmp_directory",  
     ......  
   "referenceIdentifiers":[  
      {  
         "type":"cwe",  
         "id":"79"  
      }  
    ],  
   "_rawIssueCwe": {  
     "id" : 377,  
     "link" : "https://cwe.mitre.org/data.definitions/377.html"  
   },  
   "_rawMoreInfo" : "https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/1.7.4/plugins/b108_hardcoded_tmp_directory.html",  
   "_rawColOffset":31  
}
```
The custom fields will get grouped together at the end of the issue details like this:

## Pipeline example for ingesting data from an unsupported schema into STO

The following pipeline shows an end-to-end ingestion workflow. The pipeline consist of a Security Tests stage with two steps:

1. A Run step that generates a JSON data file `/shared/customer_artifacts/example.json` in the format described above.

2. A Custom Ingest step that ingests and normalizes the data from `/shared/customer_artifacts/example.json`.
