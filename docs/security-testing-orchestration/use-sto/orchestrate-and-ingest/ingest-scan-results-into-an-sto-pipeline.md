In an ingestion-only workflow, the scan step ingest results generated in a previous step or outside the pipeline. The pipeline then analyzes, deduplicates, and displays the results. Ingestion-only workflows enable you to do the following:

- Ingest results from scanners that don't currently have integrations with Harness STO. 
- Create advanced workflows that aren't possible with orchestration scans. 
- Run custom scans with advanced settings that address specific security requirements. 
- Ingest results from multiple scans into the same pipeline, aggregate and deduplicate the data, and view all your results in a single pane of glass.

To ingest scan results from outside a Security step, you set up your pipeline as follows:

1. A Run step saves scan results to a shared folder. The step might run the scan locally, download results from an external source, or copy results from the codebase into the shared folder.

2. A [Security step or scanner template](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/sto-techref-category/security-step-settings-reference#security-steps-and-scanner-templates-in-sto) ingests the results from the shared folder. Then it analyzes, deduplicates, and displays the results.
