title: Adding Custom Artifacts to STO Pipelines
description: This topic describes how to include SSL certificates and other types of artifacts in your STO pipelines.

In some cases, a scanner might require additional files such as SSL certificates and license files. The following steps describe the high-level workflow.

1) For each artifact that contains sensitive information, such as an SSL certificate, create a Harness secret.

2) Go to the pipeline where you want to add the artifact.

3) In the stage where that will use the artifact, go to **Overview** > **Shared Paths** and create a folder under **/shared** such as **/shared/customer_artifacts**. 

:::note
To add a PEM file or other SSL certificate, the shared folder should be **/shared/customer_artifacts/certificates**. You can include any number of certificates in this folder.
:::

1) Add a Run step to the stage that adds the artifacts to the shared folder. This step needs to run _before_ the scanner step that uses the artifact. 

### Important Notes

* If the scanner uses an SSL certificate such as a PEM file, save each certificate to **/shared/customer_artifacts/`<certificate_name>`**. 

* The following example workflow uses a PEM file stored as a [Harness file secret](/docs/platform/6_Security/3-add-file-secrets.md). You can also use third-party managers such as HashiCorp Vault, Azure Key Vault, and AWS Secrets Manager. See [Harness Secrets Manager Overview](/docs/platform/6_Security/1-harness-secret-manager-overview.md).

* If the scanner requires a license file, save the file to **/shared/customer_artifacts/`<license_file_name>`**.  

* If the pipeline runs a ZAP scan that uses context files such as auth scripts, context files, or URL files, specify the following shared folders. 

  * **/shared/customer_artifacts/authScript/`<artifact_file_name>`**
  * **/shared/customer_artifacts/context/`<artifact_file_name>`**
  * **/shared/customer_artifacts/urlFile/`<artifact_file_name>`**
  * **/shared/customer_artifacts/hosts/`<artifact_file_name>`**
  
### Example workflow
  
This example shows how to include a PEM file in a pipeline that runs a SonarQube scan. This workflow assumes that you have a valid SonarQube PEM stored as a Harness File Secret. 

1. In your Harness pipeline, go to the Overview tab of the Security stage. Under **Shared Paths**, enter the following shared path: 

   `/shared/customer_artifacts/certificates`
   
   This is the default certificate location for Harness pipelines. You can copy any number of certificates to this folder.

2. Add a Run step that copies your PEM file to the certificates folder. Here's some example code that does this:

   ```
   set -e
   touch /shared/customer_artifacts/certificates/certificate
   printf "%s" "$NEWCERT" > /shared/customer_artifacts/certificates/certificate
   ```

3. Set up the remaining downstream steps in your pipeline. When the pipeline runs a SonarQube scan that requires a PEM, it looks in **/shared/customer_artifacts/certificates** and proceeds if it finds a valid certificate. 

### YAML pipeline example

The following illustrates an end-to-end pipeline that copies a PEM certificate to the default location, builds an image, and then scans the image using SonarQube (authorized using the certificate).
