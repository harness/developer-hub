After performing security scans in your pipelines, you can review the identified issues from the **[Issues](#navigate-to-issues-section)** section at the **Project** level. This section provides a consolidated view of all security issues affecting your configured baselines, providing a comprehensive list of issue identified across scans in the selected **Project**. **Issues** section is currently available only at the **Project** level. Support for **Organization** and **Account** levels will be available soon.

:::note
This is a new feature currently behind the feature flag `STO_ALL_ISSUES_PAGE` and will be generally available soon. If youâ€™d like to try it before general availability, please contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io) to enable it for your account.

Please note that, as this feature is still in early access, you may encounter occasional issues. If you do, we kindly request that you report them to your support representative.
:::

From the **Issues** section, you can:

- [View all project issues](#navigate-to-issues-section)
- [Review issue details](#issue-details)
- [Identify impacted targets](#target-details)
- [Inspect occurrences of issues](#occurrence-details)
- [Create Jira tickets from issues](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/jira-integrations)
- [Request issue exemptions](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/exemptions/exemption-workflows)

:::info
The **Issues** section displays only the issues impacting your project's [baselines](https://developer.harness.io/docs/security-testing-orchestration/get-started/key-concepts/targets-and-baselines/). If your project has no targets or baselines configured, this page will not present the issues, even if scans have been executed against non-baseline targets.

## Navigate to Issues section

Access the **Issues** section from the left navigation in the STO module. You can apply filters to effectively navigate through the issues in your project. See [Filters in Issues section](#filters-in-issues-section) for details.

### Exemption status

If an issue has an exemption status, the **Exemption Status** section will appear, showing the overall details of the exemption request. Depending on your permissions, you can take actions such as approving, rejecting, or reopening exemptions. See [Issue Exemption Workflow](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/exemptions/exemption-workflows).
