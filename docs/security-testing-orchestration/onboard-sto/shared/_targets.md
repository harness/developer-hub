Every scan step has a specific _target_, which is a user-defined label for the code repository, container, application, or configuration to scan. You define the test target when you configure the scan step. It is good practice to create descriptive, specific labels for your scan targets. 

You can view all your targets in one page: go to **Security Tests** (left menu) and then **Test Targets**.
