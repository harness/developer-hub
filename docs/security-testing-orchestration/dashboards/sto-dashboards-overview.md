In Harness, [Dashboards](/docs/platform/dashboards/dashboards-overview) provide a visual interface to gather, analyze, and monitor data across different modules. Each module contributes its own dashboards with metrics relevant to that moduleâ€™s functionality. All dashboards are available at the **Account level** only.

STO dashboards offer visibility into security tests, scan results, scanner usage, targets, and pipeline execution data etc. Each dashboard includes charts, tables, and graphs, along with filters that help you drill down into specific data as needed.

STO includes the following dashboards:

- **[Security Testing Dashboard](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/dashboards/security-testing-dashboard)**
- **[STO Usage Dashboard](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/dashboards/sto-usage-dashboard)**
- **[STO Pipeline Execution Summary](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/dashboards/sto-pipeline-execution-summary)**

Each dashboard presents data based on its specific focus. For more information, see the documentation for each dashboard.

:::tip
You can also create custom dashboards tailored to your specific use case. Refer to [Create Dashboards](/docs/platform/dashboards/create-dashboards) documentation to learn more.
