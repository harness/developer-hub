Issue exemptions help unblock pipelines by allowing security teams to temporarily bypass specific security issues that would otherwise fail the build. To understand how exemptions fit into your security workflow, refer to the [issue exemptions workflow](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/exemptions/issue-exemption-workflow).

You can create exemption requests either for the entire issue or for specific occurrences within an issue:
- [**Create Exemption Request for an Issue**](#create-exemption-request-for-an-issue): When creating an exemption request for an entire issue, you can set the exemption scope at the [Project](#where-do-you-want-this-issue-to-be-exempted), [Pipeline](#where-do-you-want-this-issue-to-be-exempted), or [Target](#where-do-you-want-this-issue-to-be-exempted) level. Refer to this section for detailed instructions.
- [**Create Exemption Request for Occurrences within Issue**](#create-exemption-request-for-occurrences-within-issue): When creating exemption request for selected occurrences of an issue, the exemption scope is limited to the [Target](#where-do-you-want-this-issue-to-be-exempted) level. Refer to this section for step-by-step guidance.

Reviewers have the flexibility to approve exemption requests either at the requested scope or extend the scope to the **Organization** or **Account** level during the review process. For more details, refer to [Manage Issue Exemptions](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/exemptions/manage-exemptions). To view submitted requests, refer to [View Issue Exemptions](#view-issue-exemptions).

:::note
Support for **Exemptions** at **Organization** and **Account** level is is controlled by the feature flag  `STO_GLOBAL_EXEMPTIONS`. Contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io) to enable it.

:::note
To create an exemption request, you must have the necessary permissions (**Exemptions: View, Create/Edit**) at the Project level, or you can have the **Security Testing Developer** or **Security Testing AppSec** roles assigned. Refer [Permissions required for issue exemptions](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/exemptions/issue-exemption-workflow#required-permissions-for-issue-exemptions) for more details.

## Create Exemption Request for an Issue
To request an exemption for an entire issue, you can set the exemption scope at the [Project](#where-do-you-want-this-issue-to-be-exempted), [Pipeline](#where-do-you-want-this-issue-to-be-exempted), or [Target](#where-do-you-want-this-issue-to-be-exempted) level. To begin, [navigate to the **Security Tests** tab](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/view-security-test-results/view-scan-results#navigate-to-security-test-results).

1. In the **Security Tests** tab, locate and select the specific issue for which you want to request an exemption. This action opens the **Issue Details** pane on the right.

2. In the **Issue Details** pane, click **Request Exemption**.

### Submit Exemption Request

Fill out the **Request Exemption for Issue** form with the following fields:  
<DocImage path={require('./static/request-exemption-form.png')} width="40%" height="40%" title="Click to view full-size image" />

#### Where do you want this issue to be exempted?

Specify where the exemption should apply:

- **This Target**: Exempts the issue only for the selected target. The issue remains reported in other targets or pipelines.  
- **This Pipeline**: Exempts the issue only in the current pipeline. The issue is still reported in other pipelines or projects.  
- **This Project**: Exempts the issue across all pipelines and targets within this project. Choose carefully, as the exemption applies broadly within the project.  

:::info
While requests can only be created with the scopes mentioned above, reviewers can approve and apply them at the requested scope or at a higher scope - **Organization** or **Account**.
:::
#### For how long?

Select the shortest practical time window for the exemption to limit the risk exposure.

#### Reason

Select one of the following reasons and provide relevant details:

- **Compensating controls**: Your organization has controls (e.g., firewall, IPS) in place that reduce the risk posed by this issue.  
- **Acceptable use**: The flagged practice is acceptable based on internal security policies.  
- **Acceptable risk**: The risk is low, and remediation would require significant resources or impact functionality.  
- **False positives**: The scanner flagged a non-issue. Confirmed by a security assessor or internal review.  
- **Fix unavailable**: No known fix or remediation steps currently exist for the issue.  
- **Other**: Provide a detailed technical explanation for why the issue should be exempted.

#### Further Description

Add any technical context, mitigations, or supporting information that will help the reviewer understand why the exemption is justified.

#### URL Reference

Add a link to supporting documentation, source code, or any relevant resource that provides additional context.

After completing the form, click **Create Request** to submit the exemption.

Once the exemption request is submitted:
- Inform your **Security Testing AppSec** reviewer.  
- Ensure they have enough context and links to make a well-informed decision.

## Create Exemption Request for Occurrences within Issue
To request an exemption for selected occurrences of an issue, the exemption scope can only be set to the [Target](#where-do-you-want-this-issue-to-be-exempted) level. To begin, [navigate to the **Security Tests** tab](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/view-security-test-results/view-scan-results#navigate-to-security-test-results).

:::note
This feature is behind the feature flag `STO_OCCURRENCE_EXEMPTION`. Contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io) to enable it.
:::

1. In the **Security Tests** tab, locate and select the specific issue for which you want to request an exemption. This action opens the **Issue Details** pane on the right.
2. In the **Issue Details** pane, click the **Occurrences** tab.
3. Select the occurrences for which you want to request the exemption.
4. Review the selected occurrences and click the **Request Occurrence Exemption** button. This will open the **Request Exemption** dialog box.

- **Exemption Duration**: e.g., Exempted for all time  
- **Requested by**: User who submitted the request  
- **Actions**: Based on your permissions and request status — Approve, Reject, Cancel, Reopen

<DocImage path={require('./static/view-exemptions.png')} width="100%" height="100%" title="Click to view full-size image" />

Here are the columns that are specific to status tab.

Clicking on an exemption request opens the **Exemption Details** pane, which provides a detailed overview of the request along with available actions (based on your permissions).

<DocImage path={require('./static/exemption-details-side-pane.png')} width="80%" height="80%" title="Click to view full-size image" />

This pane includes the following details:

- **Occurrences:** Lists all the occurrences of the issue across different scans, and targets where it was detected.
