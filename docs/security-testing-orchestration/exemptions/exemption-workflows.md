When security scanning results in a list of issues with varying severities that could potentially block your pipelines, you can request an exemption to bypass specific issues. This ensures that approved exemptions are ignored in future scans, allowing your pipelines to continue uninterrupted.

:::note
To raise an issue exemption, you must have **Security Testing Developer** or **Security Testing SecOps** user permissions.
:::

To request an issue exemption, follow these steps:

1. Select **Executions** (left menu) and then go to a successful build.  

2. Select **Security Tests** and then do the following:

   1. Select the issue you want to exempt.  The **Issue Details** pane opens on the right. 
   2. Select **Request Exemption**.

   3. In **Request Exemption for Issue**, specify:
      1. **Where do you want this issue to be Exempted?** 

         Select **This Pipeline** unless you know it's safe to exempt the issue everywhere in the project.

      2. **For how long?** 

         In general, you should select the shortest practical time window for your exemption. 

      3. **[Reason this issue should be exempted](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/exemptions/issue-exemption-workflow#when-exemptions-are-useful)** 

         Select one of the following reasons and provide any additional information for the [Security Testing SecOps](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/get-started/onboarding-guide#add-security-testing-roles)  approver:

         * **Compensating controls** — Your organization has infrastructure and policies in place to mitigate the security risks of this vulnerability. 

           For example, suppose a scan detects a vulnerability with a specific service. This vulnerability might be mitigated because:

           - The service is behind a firewall that requires authorized access, or

           - The network may have host- or network-based intrusion prevention systems in place.

         * **Acceptable use** — The scanner identified this practice as a vulnerability, but this practice is acceptable based on your organization's security guidelines. For example, anonymous FTP access may be a deliberate practice and not a vulnerability.

         * **Acceptable risk** — The security risk of this vulnerability is low and remediation would require too much effort or expense: 

           - Applying a specific patch for a vulnerability might prevent a service from functioning. 

           - The vulnerability is minimal and the remediation would require too much time, money, or resources.

         * **False positives** — The scanner identifies this as a vulnerability but it is, in fact, a false positive. Requesting an exemption based on approval from a Qualified Security Assessor (QSA) or Approved Scanning Vendor (ASV). 

         * **Fix unavailable** — There are currently no known fixes or remediation steps available for the detected vulnerability. 

         * **Other**

      4. **Further description the reason this issue should be exempted** 

         It is good practice to provide enough information for the reviewer to determine that this exemption is safe.

      4. **URL Reference** 

         Paste the link you copied in the previous request, or add a different link that provides information about the specific issue you want the pipeline to ignore. If your repo already addresses the issue, for example, you can include a link to the relevant code.

   5. Click **Create Request**.

3. Send an email or Slack to your [Security Testing SecOps](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/get-started/onboarding-guide#add-security-testing-roles)  reviewer with the URL to the Security Tests page with the relevant issue selected.
