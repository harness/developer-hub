IaCM Default Pipelines offer a streamlined approach to provisioning, destroying, and managing infrastructure workspaces by allowing you to run your pre-configured pipelines directly from any workspace. These pipelines can be easily created and set as defaults at the project level, providing quick and consistent access across all workspaces. This functionality ensures a seamless experience and maintains uniformity throughout your infrastructure management. 

In addition, as some workspaces may require specialized pipelines, you can overwrite the defaults at the workspace level. This will not disrupt any other workspace using the project level defaults.

A pipeline containing the `destroy` command will remove all saved infrastructure managed by your Harness workspace.

### Prerequisites

- You have created pipelines to Provision, Plan, Destroy and Check for drift to be assigned as defaults.

### Set your project-level default pipelines
1. In your IaCM module, select **Project settings**, then select **IaCM Defaults**.
2. Select the appropriate pipelines for your default categories and frameworks (OpenTofu / Terraform):
   - **Plan:** Pipeline for running the plan only.
   - **Provision:** Pipeline for initializing, planning, approving, and applying changes.
   - **Detect Drift:** Pipeline for detecting drift between your configuration and provider state. 
   - **Destroy:** Pipeline for initializing, planning, approving, and destroying infrastructure.

### Review your default pipelines in your workspace
3. Select **Workspaces**, then select one of your workspaces to run your default pipelines.
4. Select the **Configuration** tab and scroll down to **Default pipelines** to inspect or override your default pipelines at the selected workspace-level (this will not effect your project level settings).

### Run your default pipelines in your workspace
5. While in your workspace, run your default pipelines against it with the `Plan`, `Provision` and `Check for Drift` buttons.

:::note execute the destroy pipeline
To prevent accidental execution, the Destroy pipeline is in your workspaceâ€™s **Configuration** tab, under **Danger Zone**.

To run it, select **Destroy workspace**.

Review previously run pipelines by selecting your workspace and reviewing the **Execution History** tab.
