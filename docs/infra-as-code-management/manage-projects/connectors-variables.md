**Connectors and Variables** define the full set of inputs and integrations your workspace uses when running **Plan**, **Apply**, or **Drift detection** pipelines. These inputs can come from multiple sources and are resolved based on a clear order of precedence.

## Connectors
A **connector** is required to authenticate with cloud providers or external systems. Most workspace operations, like fetching modules or variable files, depend on a connector.

:::tip add connectors
Connectors can be added via Account Settings or directly from your workspaces **Connectors and Variables** tab.
:::

### Add a connector
1. From your workspace **Connectors and Variables** tab, click **+ Connector**.
2. Select an existing connector from your account or project scope (e.g., `aws-oidc`).

Or, you can add a new connector by clicking **+ New Connector**.

:::info interactive guide
Also, see [Add Connectors](/docs/infra-as-code-management/get-started/#add-connectors) for an interactive guide.
:::

### Connectors from templates
If your workspace is created from a workspace template, it may include connectors defined in the template.

- These appear in the **Connectors and Variables** tab.
- Currently, these connectors **cannot be modified** in the workspace.

### Multiple Connectors
You can attach more than one connector to a workspace. This allows your IaCM runs to access multiple cloud providers or external systems from a single workspace (for example, both AWS and Azure). However, a workspace can only have one connector per provider type (for example, one AWS, one GCP, one Azure).

- Connectors appear in the **Connectors and Variables** tab.
- If a workspace is created from a template, template-defined connectors are included automatically (read-only).
- You can add more connectors inline or select from account/project scope.

---

## Variable sources
:::info set variables
You can provide variables in the following ways:

- **Variable Sets:** Reusable collections of variables and secrets defined at the account level and applied to multiple workspaces.
- **Workspace Templates:** Predefined templates that inject connectors and variables into workspaces.
- **Workspace-level variables:** Environment variables and OpenTofu/Terraform variables defined directly in the workspace.
- **Variable files:** `.tfvars`, `.json`, or `.yaml` files stored in Git and linked to the workspace.
- **Connectors:** Authentication references for cloud providers, Git, and external systems (used for fetching modules, variable files, or credentials).
- **HCL defaults:** Default values defined directly in your OpenTofu/Terraform code.
- **Pipeline-level variables:** Values passed at runtime from pipelines.
  :::

### Order of precedence

Variables can be defined in multiple places. The order of precedence determines which value is used if the same variable appears more than once.

<DocTable>
| Priority       | Source                                                                 |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 (highest)    | Workspace Template variables                                           |
| 2              | Workspace-level variables (Environment or OpenTofu/Terraform variables)|
| 3              | Variable Sets (in their assigned priority order)                       |
| 4 (lowest)     | HCL default values in your code                                        |
</DocTable>

**If a variable is defined in multiple places, Harness resolves conflicts using this order of precedence.**

### Environment variables
Environment variables provide runtime configuration for your infrastructure. These behave like standard shell variables and can be used by your provisioning logic, module behavior, or CLI tooling.

- **Key**: The name of the variable (e.g., `TF_LOG`, `ENVIRONMENT`).
- **Value**: You can set a static value, insert a pipeline variable (FQN), or use **`<+input>`** for runtime input.

#### Add an environment variable
1. Click **+ New Environment Variable**.
2. Define the `Type` (usually `string`).
3. Provide a `Key` and a `Value`.

```yaml
# Example: Static and runtime-injected environment variables
environmentVariables:
  - key: TF_LOG
    value: INFO
    type: String
    source: CUSTOM
  - key: ENVIRONMENT
    value: <+input>
    type: String
    source: CUSTOM
```

---

### OpenTofu/Terraform variables
OpenTofu/Terraform variables (`variable {}` blocks in your code) must be declared by name and value. These are injected into Terraform runs and used in your `*.tf` files.

1. Click **+ Add Variable** under the **OpenTofu/Terraform Variables** section.
2. Define the `Key` to match your Terraform variable name.
3. Set the `Value`, or use **`<+input>`** for runtime prompts.

---

Each variable declared in your OpenTofu/Terraform code must be supplied with a value from one of the following input sources. If a variable is defined in multiple places, the order of precedence determines which value is used:

The following options are available in order of precedence, go to [Order of Precedence](#order-of-precedence) for the full list of variable options in order of precedence:

#### Option 1: Define default values in HCL
You can assign a default value directly in your OpenTofu/Terraform code. This acts as a fallback if no value is provided from the workspace or pipeline.

```hcl
# main.tf
variable "instance_type" {
  type    = string
  default = "t3.micro"
}
```

#### Option 2: Provide values in the Workspace
Configure variables in the OpenTofu/Terraform Variables section of your workspace. These values override any defaults in your code.

```yaml
# Workspace configuration
terraformVariables:
  - key: instance_type
    value: <+input> # or a static value like "t3.large"
    type: String
    source: CUSTOM
```

:::tip runtime input
Use `<+input>` to prompt users for values at runtime.
:::

---

### Variable files
Variable files allow you to inject multiple variables via `.tfvars`, `.json`, or `.yaml` files stored in Git.

#### Add a variable file
1. Click **+ New Variable File**.
2. Select the **Connector** to access your Git repo.
3. Choose a repository, branch, and file path (e.g., `main`, `envs/dev.tfvars`).

:::note
Harness will retrieve and use this file during your pipeline execution. You can include multiple files if needed.
:::

```yaml
# Workspace variable file definition
variableFiles:
  - type: Git
    spec:
      connectorRef: account.git_connector
      repoName: terraform-configs
      branch: main
      paths:
        - envs/dev.tfvars
```

:::info variable file source
Your variable files and HCL can come from the same Git repository or different repositories.
:::

---

### Variable Sets
A Variable Set is a reusable collection of environment variables, OpenTofu/Terraform variables, and secrets. They allow you to standardize configuration across multiple workspaces.

Variable Sets are supported at the account, org, and project level:

- Navigate to **Account Settings** > **IaCM Settings** > **Variable Sets**.
- **Create:** Click **Create a new Variable Set**.
- **Update:** Click an existing Variable Set tile.
- **Delete:** Use the ellipsis menu on a Variable Set tile and select **Delete**.

When applied to a workspace, Variable Sets can be prioritized. Variables from a higher-priority set will override those from lower-priority sets.

:::tip Variable set priority
In the **Connectors and Variables** tab of a workspace, drag Variable Sets to set their priority.
Priority 1 > Priority 2 > Priority 3.
:::

---

### Input Sources and Runtime Behavior
Each variable shows its **source**, such as:

- `TEMPLATE`: inherited from the selected Template.
- `CUSTOM`: defined directly in the workspace.

You can use **`<+input>`** to prompt users to supply values at runtime.

## Next Steps
- [Provision your workspace](/docs/infra-as-code-management/workspaces/provision-workspace) using the configured inputs.
- [Add OPA policies](/docs/infra-as-code-management/policies-governance/opa-workspace) to enforce policy compliance.
