:::warning
**Provider Registry** is currently **pending release** and will be available soon!
:::

The Harness IaCM **Provider Registry** allows you to securely publish and distribute <Tooltip id="iacm.provider-registry.custom-provider">custom providers</Tooltip>. Providers are signed with <Tooltip id="iacm.provider-registry.gpg-key">GPG keys</Tooltip>, compiled as <Tooltip id="iacm.provider-registry.binary-files">binary files</Tooltip> for <Tooltip id="iacm.provider-registry.multiple-platforms">multiple platforms</Tooltip>, and made available for use in [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/) or Terraform configurations.

- Found under **IaCM > Registry** (alongside [Module Registry](/docs/infra-as-code-management/registry/module-registry) and GPG Keys).
- Providers are published as **compiled binaries** for supported operating systems like macOS, Linux, or Windows.
- **GPG keys** are required to sign provider binaries for verification.

:::tip Example use case  
A DevOps team creates a **custom provider** to integrate OpenTofu with their internal APIs.  
By publishing it in the Provider Registry, developers across macOS, Linux, and Windows can seamlessly consume the provider during `tofu init` without manually managing binaries.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have:
1. **Access and permissions** to IaCM and the **Registry** area in your Harness project.
2. A local build environment to **compile your provider** into platform-specific binaries (for example, Go or Java toolchains).
3. [**GPG tooling installed**](https://www.gnupg.org/download/) on your machine.

---

## Provider Preparation
Provider Registry assumes that your binaries are already signed with a GPG key. If you need to generate one, you can use the industry standard GPG commands shown below. 

### GPG Key Setup
GPG keys are required to sign provider binaries before publishing.

:::info Required values
- **Name**
- **Key ID**
- **ASCII armored public key**
:::

Follow the three steps below to generate a GPG key:

<Tabs queryString="gpg-key-setup">
<TabItem value="1. Generate a GPG key" label="1. Generate a GPG key">

```bash
gpg --full-generate-key
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="2. List GPG keys" label="2. List GPG keys">

```bash
gpg --list-keys --keyid-format LONG
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="3. Export GPG key" label="3. Export GPG key">
Export GPG key (in ASCII armor format)
```bash
gpg --armor --export <KEY_ID>
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

If you need more information on how to generate GPG Keys, go to [Generating a new GPG key for full instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/generating-a-new-gpg-key).

### Add your GPG key to IaCM
1. Go to **IaCM > Registry > GPG Keys**
2. Click **New GPG Key**
3. Enter the **Name**, **Key ID**, and **ASCII armored public key** as generated in the previous steps above.
4. Click **Save**

### File Requirements
Each provider version requires the following artifacts:
- Compiled binaries for each supported OS/architecture.
- A SHA256SUMS checksum file.
- A SHA256SUMS.sig signature file.

<Tabs queryString="file-requirements">
<TabItem value="create-checksum" label="1. Create CHECKSUM file">

```bash
shasum -a 256 * > SHA256SUMS
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="sign-checksum" label="2. Sign the CHECKSUM file:">

```bash
gpg --default-key <KEY_ID> --output SHA256SUMS.sig --detach-sign SHA256SUMS
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Provider Registration
<Tabs queryString="provider-registration">
<TabItem value="Interactive guide" label="Interactive guide">
<DocVideo src="https://app.tango.us/app/embed/c6beb8f1-75df-4c1d-bbab-3d87209ef6fd?skipCover=true&defaultListView=false&skipBranding=false&makeViewOnly=true&hideAuthorAndDetails=true" title="Registry a Provider in Harness IaCM" />
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="step-by-step" label="Step-by-Step">

1. From the IaCM module, go to **Registry**, then select the **Provider Registry** tab.
2. Click **New Provider** and enter a provider name.
3. Add a version (must follow semantic versioning, e.g., 1.0.0).
4. Select one of your stored GPG keys.
5. Choose a provider protocol version, e.g. v4, v5, v6.

:::info provider protocol versions
The provider protocol defines the interface and communication standard between OpenTofu or Terraform and external providers. Each protocol version (e.g., v4, v5, v6) specifies how providers should implement functions, handle requests, and structure their schemas. Newer protocol versions add features, improve security, and may deprecate older behaviors. Select the protocol version that matches your provider implementation and the Terraform/OpenTofu version you intend to support.

Selecting multiple provider protocol versions allows your provider to be compatible with a wider range of Terraform or OpenTofu versions, and to support users who may not yet have upgraded to the latest protocol.
:::

6. Upload the required files:
- Compiled binaries for all supported OS/architectures.
- SHA256SUMS checksum file.
- SHA256SUMS.sig signature file.

7. Verify that all registry files are uploaded.

:::note Draft state
If you do not publish the version immediately, it remains in a draft state. Drafts allow you to upload additional binaries, checksums, or signature files later before finalizing the version. Draft versions are not available for consumption in OpenTofu/Terraform until they are published.
:::

8. Click **Publish** once all files are uploaded. The system will validate the upload and publish the provider version.

:::warning Publishing will fail if:
- Any required file is missing.
- Filename versions donâ€™t match the version you entered.
- The .sig or checksum file does not match.

<TabItem value="yaml" label="YAML">

```yaml
# Example placeholder for future CLI/YAML-based setup
provider:
  name: myprovider
  version: 1.0.0
  gpg_key: <KEY_ID>
  protocols: ["5"]
  files:
    - darwin_arm64/myprovider_v1.0.0
    - darwin_amd64/myprovider_v1.0.0
    - linux_amd64/myprovider_v1.0.0
    - windows_amd64/myprovider_v1.0.0
    - SHA256SUMS
    - SHA256SUMS.sig
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Use Published Providers
Once published, providers can be consumed directly in Tofu/Terraform configuration:

For example:
```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    <provider-name> = {
      source = "<provider-name>.app.harness.io/account/<harness-account-id>/<provider-name>"
      version = "1.0.0"
    }
  }
}
provider "<provider-name>" {
 # Configuration options 
}
```

When you run the <Tooltip id="iacm.tf-commands.init">init</Tooltip> command, OpenTofu/Terraform will automatically pull the correct binary for your operating system.

---

## Troubleshooting
- **Version mismatches:** Versions in your binary filenames must match the registry version exactly (e.g., 1.0.0 vs 1.0.1).
- **Missing files:** Publishing requires all binaries, checksum, and signature files.

## Next Steps
Explore other reusable features in IaCM:
- [**Module Registry**](/docs/infra-as-code-management/registry/module-registry): publish and share Terraform/OpenTofu modules.
- [**Workspace Templates**](/docs/infra-as-code-management/workspaces/workspace-templates): standardize workspace configurations across teams.
