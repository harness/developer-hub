## Workspace-related questions
<details>
    <summary>Can we use multiple workspaces in a single stage?</summary>

    No, a single stage is limited to one workspace. However, a pipeline can include multiple stages, and each stage can be configured to reference a different workspace. This allows you to structure your pipeline to handle multiple workspaces by chaining stages, each performing specific tasks on its assigned workspace.

## Cost-related questions

    <summary>Can drift detection incur additional costs?</summary>

    No, usage charges are only incurred when an `apply` changes resources. The `plan` command and drift detection are free.
