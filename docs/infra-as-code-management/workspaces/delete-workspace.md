In cases where your workspace has become redundant and you no longer need it, you can delete it from your Harness account. As a safeguard, Harness have several confirmation steps to ensure that workspaces aren't mistakenly deleted.

:::warning
Deleting a workspace will remove it from Harness along with all associated resources.
:::

### Prerequisites
- Ensure that the resources associated with your workspace are no longer needed.
- Your workspace must be in an `inactive` status

        If your workspace already has an `inactive` status, you can delete a workspace via the [Harness API destroy-workspace endpoint](https://apidocs.harness.io/tag/workspaces#operation/workspaces_destroy-workspace).

        ```bash
            curl -i -X DELETE \
            'https://app.harness.io/iacm/api/orgs/{org}/projects/{project}/workspaces/{identifier}' \
            -H 'Harness-Account: <YOUR_HARNESS_ACCOUNT_ID>' \
            -H 'x-api-key: <YOUR_API_KEY_HERE>'
        ```

        If your workspace is still active, deactivate it before calling the above endpoint with a [destroy-workspace pipeline](https://developer.harness.io/docs/infra-as-code-management/use-iacm/provision-workspace#destroy-a-workspace)
