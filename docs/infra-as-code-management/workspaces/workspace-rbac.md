For each Role, you can define the following set of permissions:

1. **View** - Giving users the permission to view thw Workspaces in the project
2. **Create/Edit** - Giving users the permission to create and edit Workspaces in the project
3. **Delete** - Giving users the permission to delete Workspaces in the project
4. **Edit Variables** - Giving users the permission to create and edit Environment and Terraform variables
5. **Delete Variables** - Giving users the permission to delete Environment and Terraform variables
6. **Approve** - Giving users the permission to approve Infrastructure Stage (using the approval step)
7. **Access State** - Giving users the permissions to view the state (including historical revisions)

## Using Resource Groups
Users can utilize Resource Groups functionality to specify which users can access a specific Workspace. 
To do that, users should create a resource group, add the specific (or all) Workspaces, and bind it to a specific user or user group.
