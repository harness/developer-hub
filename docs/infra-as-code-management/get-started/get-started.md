Welcome to the Harness IaCM onboarding guide. Discover how Harness streamlines and secures your infrastructure management with Infrastructure as Code Management (IaCM).

## What is IaCM?
IaC automates infrastructure management via code. IaCM enhances this by ensuring consistent, accountable, and repeatable deployments. Harness boosts IaCM with [**real-time cost estimation**](/docs/infra-as-code-management/workspaces/cost-estimation), [**automated policy enforcement**](/docs/infra-as-code-management/policies-governance/terraform-plan-cost-policy), and [**drift detection**](/docs/infra-as-code-management/pipelines/operations/drift-detection), ensuring efficient provisioning and compliance with standards.

 For **Terraform**, we support all MPL versions up to **1.5.x**, any BSL versions (from 1.6.0) are not supported.

Follow this [**OpenTofu migration guide**](https://opentofu.org/docs/intro/migration/) to transition from Terraform to OpenTofu and leverage the benefits of this open-source alternative.
