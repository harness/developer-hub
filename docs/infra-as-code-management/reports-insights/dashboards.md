Harness Custom Dashboards provide a fully integrated BI experience powered by IaCM data, offering deep visibility into workspace metrics and insights not typically surfaced elsewhere in the platform.

## Use Cases
The IaCM Dashboard is designed to help you:

- Visualize the **count of workspaces** by organization and project.
- List **modules in use** and identify how many workspaces are using them. [Learn more about Harness module registry](/docs/infra-as-code-management/iacm-features/module-registry/module-registry-code-structure)
- Create visualizations based on **workspace tags** (e.g., "team:europe") to better understand resource allocation.
- **Monitor provider compliance** across your infrastructure:
  - Track what percentage of workspaces are using [**OpenTofu**](https://opentofu.org/) or Terraform.
  - Identify projects using outdated or non-compliant provider versions
  - Ensure standardization across cloud providers and tools

:::tip OpenTofu migration
Harness supports all OpenTofu versions, and Terraform MPL versions up to 1.5.x, any BSL versions (from 1.6.0) are not supported. 
Follow this [**OpenTofu migration guide**](https://opentofu.org/docs/intro/migration/) to transition from Terraform to OpenTofu and leverage the benefits of this open-source alternative.
