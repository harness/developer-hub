:::warning pending release
IaCM Module Registry is currently pending release and will be available soon! [Learn more](https://www.harness.io/blog/harness-iacm-module-registry).
:::

## Prerequisites
- A registered infrastructure module, to register a new module, go to [Register a module](https://developer.harness.io/docs/infra-as-code-management/iacm-features/module-registry#register-a-module)

Once your have registered an infrastructure module, Harness automatically parses the metadata from your connected repository, so your module information is readily available for re-use. 

## Registered module tabs
This document walks through each tab of a registered module, explaining its data, settings, and usage to help you configure and manage your module effectively.

:::note information source
The information populated in the Harness Module Registry comprises the metadata stored in the connected code repository and is therefore controlled by the module authors.

Each tab has information populated from different files and can be determined by the repositories file structure.
:::

### Readme
The Readme tabs directly reflects and renders the `README.md` file in your modules connected repository.

### Instructions
The Instructions tab provides a code snippet that you can copy and integrate into your Terraform code. This allows you to seamlessly incorporate the infrastructure defined in your module into your environment once the code is applied.

### Inputs
The inputs tab is populated from the `variables.tf` file. Here are some examples:

```hcl
    variable "aws-region" {
    description = "The AWS region to deploy resources"
    type        = string
    default     = "us-west-2"
    }

    variable "instance_type" {
    description = "EC2 instance type"
    type        = string
    default     = "t2.micro"
    }
```

### Outputs
The outputs tab is populated from the `outputs.tf` file. Example outputs might include:

```hcl
    output "instance_id" {
    description = "The ID of the EC2 instance"
    value       = aws_instance.example.id
    }

    output "public_ip" {
    description = "The public IP address of the instance"
    value       = aws_instance.example.public_ip
    }
```

### Dependencies
The dependencies tab is populated by your `versions.tf` file.

```hcl
    terraform {
    required_providers {
        aws = {
        source  = "hashicorp/aws"
        version = "~> 3.0"
        }
    }

    required_version = ">= 0.12"
    }
```

### Resources
Resources are found in your `main.tf` file with a list of resources to be applied when you [run your provision pipelines](https://developer.harness.io/docs/infra-as-code-management/use-iacm/provision-workspace). For example:

```hcl
    resource "aws_instance" "example" {
    ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
    instance_type = var.instance_type

    tags = {
        Name = "ExampleInstance"
    }
    }
```

### Submodules
A main module is gathered from your `main.tf` file and submodules are gathered from a `modules` directory within your repository.

**Use cases:**

**Separation of concern:**
By breaking down a module into submodules, you can isolate specific functionality. For example:
    - A Kubernetes module could have submodules for managing:
    - Cluster setup.
    - Worker nodes.
    - Network policies.

**Versioning and dependency management:**
Submodules let you version and manage dependencies independently. For example:
    - If you update the networking submodule to include a new feature, it wonâ€™t impact the other submodules in the module unless explicitly updated.

**Customization and flexibility:**
Submodules can provide users with the flexibility to override or customize certain aspects. For example:
    - A cloud storage module might include submodules for S3 buckets, IAM roles, and lifecycle policies, allowing users to only configure the features they need.

## Module versions
- Select the version dropdown, which corresponds with the Git tags from your module's code repository.
- Select a version to reflect the module's state at the selected point in time.

## Source code
- Select the `SOURCE CODE` link to navigate to the module's code repository.

## Sync button
The sync button fetches any new Git tags from the module's code repository and syncs them to the Harness IaCM registered module, making the tag/version available in the version dropdown.
