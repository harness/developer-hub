[BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/) is a cloud web and mobile testing platform that provides developers with the ability to test their websites and mobile applications across on-demand browsers, operating systems and real mobile devices.

## BrowserStack Automate

[BrowserStack Automate](https://www.browserstack.com/automate-product) runs your Selenium tests on an extensive list of browsers and mobile devices, with support for CI and Local Testing.

The [Integrate BrowserStack Automate with Harness](https://www.browserstack.com/docs/automate/selenium/harness) guide from BrowserStack covers the following topics:

1. Set up a pipeline in Harness
2. Integrate existing test cases
3. Integrate test cases for locally hosted websites

:::note

When running BrowserStack tests on [Kubernetes infrastructure](../../use-ci/set-up-build-infrastructure/k8s-build-infrastructure/set-up-a-kubernetes-cluster-build-infrastructure.md), set the appropriate [resource limits](../../use-ci/set-up-build-infrastructure/resource-limits.md) required by your tests.
