:::note

Currently, Secure Connect for Harness Cloud is behind the feature flag `CI_SECURE_TUNNEL`. Contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io) to enable the feature.

:::

To use [Harness Cloud build infrastructure](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/set-up-build-infrastructure/use-harness-cloud-build-infrastructure) in firewalled environments, such as a corporate network, you can create a secure connect tunnel between the Harness Cloud network and your private network. This allows you to use Harness Cloud build infrastructure with privately-hosted assets, such as internal artifacts repositories and on-premises code repositories. Secure connect is a faster alternative to allowlisting IPs.

To configure secure connect:

1. Run the Docker client in your firewalled environment. Where you run the client depends on what assets need to securely connect to Harness and your environment's network configuration.

   ```
   docker run -it -e REMOTE_PORT=ANY_PORT_FROM_30000_TO_30100  -e REMOTE_SERVER=sc.harness.io -e API_KEY=YOUR_HARNESS_API_KEY harness/frpc-signed
   ```

   * `REMOTE_PORT` can be any port from 30000 to 30100.
   * `API_KEY` must be a valid [Harness API key](/docs/platform/automation/api/add-and-manage-api-keys).

2. Enable **Secure Connect** for each connector you use with Harness Cloud that needs to route through a secure connect tunnel. This setting is available in the connector's **Connect to Provider** settings.

   For example, if you need to connect to an on-premise code repo, you need to enable **Secure Connect** in your code repo connector's settings.

   Compatible connectors include:
   * [GitHub connectors](/docs/platform/connectors/code-repositories/ref-source-repo-provider/git-hub-connector-settings-reference)
   * [GitLab connectors](/docs/platform/connectors/code-repositories/ref-source-repo-provider/git-lab-connector-settings-reference)
   * [Bitbucket connectors](/docs/platform/connectors/code-repositories/ref-source-repo-provider/bitbucket-connector-settings-reference)
   * [Git connectors](/docs/platform/connectors/code-repositories/ref-source-repo-provider/git-connector-settings-reference)
   * [Docker connectors](/docs/platform/connectors/cloud-providers/ref-cloud-providers/docker-registry-connector-settings-reference)
   * [GCP connectors](/docs/platform/connectors/cloud-providers/connect-to-google-cloud-platform-gcp)
   * [AWS connectors](/docs/platform/connectors/cloud-providers/add-aws-connector)

Once enabled, traffic related to the configured connector is tunneled through the FRPC.

:::tip

When you enable secure connect, Harness sets two environment variables: `HARNESS_HTTP_PROXY` and `HARNESS_HTTPS_PROXY`.

You can use these environment variables in cURL commands to tunnel other clients through the established secure connect tunnel, for example:

```
curl -x HARNESS_HTTPS_PROXY YOUR_ENDPOINT_URL
```

Replace `YOUR_ENDPOINT_URL` with the URL that you want to route through the secure connect tunnel. For example, you could route a private Bitbucket domain like `https://bitbucket.myorg.com/`.
