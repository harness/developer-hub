4. Select **Upgrade** to upgrade from the Free plan to either the Team or Enterprise plans.

   If you already have a paid plan for another module, you must select the same plan level as your other subscription.

   If this is your first time upgrading any Harness module subscription, you'll also have the option to start a 14-day trial.

5. Select the number of developers who will build with Harness CI. If you were actively using a Free plan before upgrading, Harness makes a recommendation based on your previous and predicted usage.

7. Select **Next: Billing Information** and enter your billing information.

   Tax is calculated once you enter your billing zip code. This can take up to 10 seconds to calculate.

   You must save a credit card to proceed with payment. You must provide a credit card to proceed with payment. If you enter a new card during checkout, that becomes the new default payment method for your account. You can change your saved card by [updating your billing information](/docs/continuous-integration/get-started/ci-subscription-mgmt#update-your-billing-information).

8. Select **Subscribe and Pay** to submit payment. Payments are handled by Stripe.

:::info How is the total cost calculated?

The total cost is based on the plan level, the number of developers, and whether you selected the premier support package. You can toggle between **Monthly** and **Yearly** billing.

If this is your first paid plan subscription, the price doesn't include tax until you enter your billing details. If you have an existing subscription, tax is calculated based on your existing billing details.

If you have an existing subscription for another module, your new subscription is prorated so that your subscription renewal dates align. For example, if you have a CD subscription with 10 months remaining, your new CI subscription is prorated for 10 months so that both subscriptions renew at the same time.
