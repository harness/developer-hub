By default, Harness uses anonymous Docker access to connect to [pull Harness images](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/set-up-build-infrastructure/harness-ci.md). If you experience rate limiting issues when pulling images, try one of these solutions:

* Use credentialed access, rather than anonymous access, to pull Harness CI images. For instructions, go to [Connect to the Harness container image registry](/docs/platform/connectors/artifact-repositories/connect-to-harness-container-image-registry-using-docker-connector.md).
* Configure the default Docker connector to pull images from the public [Harness GCR project](https://console.cloud.google.com/gcr/images/gcr-prod/global/harness) instead of Docker Hub. For instructions, go to [Connect to the Harness container image registry](/docs/platform/connectors/artifact-repositories/connect-to-harness-container-image-registry-using-docker-connector.md).
* Sync the Harness images to your own private registry, [specify the images that you want Harness to use](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/set-up-build-infrastructure/harness-ci.md#specify-the-harness-ci-images-used-in-your-pipelines), and then configure a Docker connector to pull the images from your private repo. For an example demonstrating how to do this, go to [Configure STO to download images from a private registry](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/use-sto/set-up-sto-pipelines/download-images-from-private-registry.md).
