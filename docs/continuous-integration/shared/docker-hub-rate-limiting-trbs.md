By default, Harness uses anonymous access to [Harness Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/harness) to [pull Harness images](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/set-up-build-infrastructure/harness-ci.md). If you experience rate limiting issues when pulling images, [use a Docker connector to connect to the Harness container image registry](/docs/platform/connectors/artifact-repositories/connect-to-harness-container-image-registry-using-docker-connector/) and provide login information in the [connector's authentication settings](/docs/platform/Connectors/Artifact-Repositories/connect-to-harness-container-image-registry-using-docker-connector#step-2-enter-credentials).
