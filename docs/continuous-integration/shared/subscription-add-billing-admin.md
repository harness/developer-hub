Billing admins are users that can manage payments on your Harness account.

To add a billing admin, use Harness' [Role Based Access Control](/docs/platform/User-Management/add-users) to add a user with a **Billing Admin** role. Then assign the billing admin by going to **Account Settings** and then selecting **Billing**.
