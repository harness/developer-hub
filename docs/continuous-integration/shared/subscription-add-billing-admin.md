Billing admins are users that can manage payments on your Harness account.

If this feature is available for your module, you can add a billing admin.

1. [Add a user](/docs/platform/role-based-access-control/add-users) with a **Billing Admin** role.
2. Go to **Account Settings** and select **Billing**. In nav 2.0, **Billing** is under **Subscriptions**.
3. Assign the user as the billing admin.
