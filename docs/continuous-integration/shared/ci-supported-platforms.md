Harness CI supports a variety of platforms, repos, registries, and related technologies. The following sections list entities or providers with first-class support in Harness CI. Additional entities or providers may be supported through unofficial plugins or scripting.

### Source Code Management (SCM)

In addition to [built-in codebase cloning](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/codebase-configuration/create-and-configure-a-codebase) and support for Git functionality like [Git LFS](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/codebase-configuration/gitlfs), [subdirectory cloning](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/codebase-configuration/clone-subdirectory), and [PR status checks](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/codebase-configuration/scm-status-checks), Harness CI supports these SCM providers:

* [AWS CodeCommit](/docs/platform/connectors/code-repositories/connect-to-code-repo)
* [Azure Repos](/docs/platform/connectors/code-repositories/connect-to-a-azure-repo)
* [Bitbucket](/docs/platform/connectors/code-repositories/ref-source-repo-provider/bitbucket-connector-settings-reference)
* [GitHub](/docs/platform/connectors/code-repositories/ref-source-repo-provider/git-hub-connector-settings-reference)
* [GitLab](/docs/platform/connectors/code-repositories/ref-source-repo-provider/git-lab-connector-settings-reference)
* [Harness Code Repository](/docs/code-repository)
* Other Git providers through the [provider-agnostic Git connector](/docs/platform/connectors/code-repositories/ref-source-repo-provider/git-connector-settings-reference)

### Build infrastructure

Harness CI offers [Harness-managed and self-managed build infrastructure options](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/set-up-build-infrastructure/which-build-infrastructure-is-right-for-me.md) for a variety of operating systems and architectures, including:

* Harness CI Cloud (built in, Harness-managed, Linux/Windows/macOS)
* Local runners (Linux/Windows/macOS)
* [Kubernetes clusters](/docs/category/set-up-kubernetes-cluster-build-infrastructures):
   * Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)
   * Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
   * Red Hat OpenShift 4
   * Other, platform agnostic
* [Self-managed VMs](/docs/category/set-up-vm-build-infrastructures):
   * Microsoft Azure (Linux/Windows)
   * GCP (Linux/Windows)
   * AWS EC2 (Linux/Windows)
   * AWS EC2 (macOS) - **Harness recommends Harness CI Cloud for macOS builds due to licensing requirements and the complexity of managing macOS VMs with Anka virtualization.**

### Container registries

* Azure Container Registry (ACR)
* Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)
* Google Artifact Registry (GAR)
* Google Container Registry (GCR) (pending deprecation)
* Docker-compliant registries, such as Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry (GHCR), and JFrog Docker registries
* Other

For more information, go to [Build and push artifacts and images](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/build-and-upload-artifacts/build-and-upload-an-artifact).

### Artifact repositories

* JFrog Artifactory
* AWS S3
* GCP GCS
* Sonatype Nexus
* Other

For more information, go to [Build and push artifacts and images](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/build-and-upload-artifacts/build-and-upload-an-artifact).

### Dependencies and caching

Harness CI supports running dependent services, such as Docker-in-Docker, LocalStack, and PostgreSQL, in [Background steps](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/manage-dependencies/dependency-mgmt-strategies).

Harness offers several [caching options](/docs/category/share-and-cache-ci-data), including:

* Harness Cache Intelligence
* AWS S3
* GCP GCS
* Azure storage

### Testing frameworks
