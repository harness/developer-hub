Error analysis and remediation from AIDA is available if you have [enabled AIDA in your Harness account](/docs/platform/Harness-AIDA/aida-overview.md#enable-aida) and either:

* A step in a stage failed.
* A stage that contains no steps failed.

When viewing the logs for the failed step or stage, select the **Harness AIDA** dialog to review error analysis and troubleshooting suggestions.
