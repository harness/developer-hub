To enable AIDA for CI in your Harness account, go to **Account Settings**, select **Account Resources**, select the **Harness AIDA** tile, and then enable the **Harness AI Development Assistant (AIDA)** setting.

After enabling AIDA, error analysis and remediation from AIDA is available when a step fails or an empty stage (a stage with no steps) fails.

When viewing the logs for the failed step or stage, select the **Harness AIDA** dialog to review error analysis and troubleshooting suggestions.
