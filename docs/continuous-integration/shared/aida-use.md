To enable AIDA for CI in your Harness account, you must agree to the AIDA EULA.

1. Review the [AIDA Terms](https://www.harness.io/legal/aida-terms) and [AIDA Data Privacy](https://www.harness.io/legal/aida-privacy) information.
2. In your Harness account, go to **Account Settings**, select **Account Resources**, select the **Harness AIDA** tile, and then enable the **Harness AI Development Assistant (AIDA)** setting.

Error analysis and remediation from AIDA is available when a step fails or an empty stage (a stage with no steps) fails. When viewing the logs for the failed step or stage, select the **Harness AIDA** dialog to review error analysis and troubleshooting suggestions.
