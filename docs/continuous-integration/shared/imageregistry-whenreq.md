####When are Container Registry and Image required?

The stage's build infrastructure determines whether these fields are required or optional:

* [Kubernetes cluster build infrastructure](../../set-up-build-infrastructure/k8s-build-infrastructure/set-up-a-kubernetes-cluster-build-infrastructure.md): **Container Registry** and **Image** are always required.
* [Local runner build infrastructure](../../set-up-build-infrastructure/define-a-docker-build-infrastructure.md): **Run Tests** steps can use binaries available on the host machine. The **Container Registry** and **Image** are required if the machine doesn't have the binaries you need.
* [Self-managed AWS/GCP/Azure VM build infrastructure](/docs/category/set-up-vm-build-infrastructures): **Run Tests** steps can use binaries that you've made available on your build VMs. The **Container Registry** and **Image** are required if the VM doesn't have the necessary binaries. These fields are located under **Additional Configuration** for stages that use self-managed VM build infrastructure.
* [Harness Cloud build infrastructure](../../set-up-build-infrastructure/use-harness-cloud-build-infrastructure.md): **Run Tests** steps can use binaries available on Harness Cloud machines, as described in the [image specifications](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/set-up-build-infrastructure/use-harness-cloud-build-infrastructure#platforms-and-image-specifications). The **Container Registry** and **Image** are required if the machine doesn't have the binaries you need. These fields are located under **Additional Configuration** for stages that use Harness Cloud build infrastructure.
