This topic contains general troubleshooting information for error messages and other issues that can arise.

If you cannot find a resolution, please contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io) or visit the [Harness Community Forum](https://community.harness.io/).

## Git connector fails to connect to the SCM service

If you have configured your build infrastructure to use self-signed certificates, your builds may fail when the Git connector attempts to connect to the SCM service. Build logs may contain the following error messages:

```
Connectivity Error while communicating with the scm service
Unable to connect to Git Provider, error while connecting to scm service
```

To resolve this issue, add `SCM_SKIP_SSL=true` to the `environment` section of the delegate YAML.

For example, here is the `environment` section of a `docker-compose.yml` file with the `SCM_SKIP_SSL` variable:

```yaml
environment:
      - ACCOUNT_ID=XXXX
      - DELEGATE_TOKEN=XXXX
      - MANAGER_HOST_AND_PORT=https://app.harness.io
      - LOG_STREAMING_SERVICE_URL=https://app.harness.io/log-service/
      - DEPLOY_MODE=KUBERNETES
      - DELEGATE_NAME=test
      - NEXT_GEN=true
      - DELEGATE_TYPE=DOCKER
      - SCM_SKIP_SSL=true
```

## Test suites wrongly parsed

The parsed test report in the **Tests** tab comes strictly from the provided test reports. The reports must be in JUnit XML format. It is important to adhere to the standard [JUnit format](https://llg.cubic.org/docs/junit/) to improve test suite parsing.

## Truncated execution logs

Each CI step supports a maximum log size of 5MB. Harness truncates logs larger than 5MB.

## AKS builds timeout

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) security group restrictions can cause builds running on an AKS build infrastructure to timeout.

If you have a custom network security group, it must allow inbound traffic on port 8080, which the Delegate service uses.

For more information, refer to the following Microsoft Azure troubleshooting documentation: [A custom network security group blocks traffic](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/azure-kubernetes/custom-nsg-blocks-traffic).
