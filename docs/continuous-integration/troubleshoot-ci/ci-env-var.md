This topic describes environment variables you might encounter when using Harness CI. These variables contain information about the build, such as how the build started, codebase information, build infrastructure, step identifiers, and more. These are pipeline runtime environment variables, and they are available to all stages and steps in the pipeline.

This reference focuses on Harness CI-specific environment variables prefixed by `CI_`, `HARNESS_`, and `DRONE_`. However, additional environment variables can be present based on your build infrastructure, build tools, specific steps used, and other pipeline configuration possibilities. You can use a `printenv` command in a [Run step](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/run-step-settings.md) to get a list of environment variables for a specific stage.

## Reference environment variables

You can reference Harness CI environment variables through either:

* Direct reference in scripts and commands, when available, such as `machine ${DRONE_NETRC_MACHINE}`.
* Equivalent [Harness expressions](/docs/platform/variables-and-expressions/harness-variables), such as `<+pipeline.sequenceId>` for `HARNESS_BUILD_ID`.

## Variable resolution

The value of an environment variable depends on the build conditions. A variable is resolved only if the build includes the necessary information for that variable.

For example, `DRONE_PULL_REQUEST` is only resolved if the build started from a pull request. Builds that aren't started from a PR won't have a PR number to assign to that variable.

### Environment variable values in manual builds

Manual builds occur when you manually run a pipeline from within Harness. If your pipeline has a [codebase configuration](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/codebase-configuration/create-and-configure-a-codebase.md), you can select a branch, PR, or tag to build.

* **Manual branch builds:** Manually run a pipeline and select the **Git Branch** build type. Harness looks for the source code attached to the specified **Branch Name**, and it clones that specific source code for the build.
* **Manual pull request (PR) builds**: Manually run a pipeline and select the **Git Pull Request** build type. Harness looks for the source code attached to the specified **Pull Request Number**, and it clones that specific source code for the build.
* **Manual tag builds:** Manually run a pipeline and select the **Git Tag** build type. Harness looks for the source code attached to the specified **Tag Name**, and it clones that specific source code for the build.

### Environment variable values in webhook trigger builds

You can automatically [trigger pipelines using Git events](/docs/platform/triggers/triggering-pipelines). [Webhook triggers](/docs/platform/triggers/triggers-reference) listen for specific events in your code repo, and then trigger builds when those events occur.

* **Pull request (PR) triggers:** A **Pull Request Webhook Event** automatically starts a build in Harness when there is a new pull request event on the pipeline's associated Git repo. You can specify the type of [pull request events](/docs/platform/triggers/triggers-reference#event-and-actions) to track, such as close, open, update/edit, reopen, and so on.
* **Push triggers:** A **Push Webhook Event** automatically starts a build in Harness when there is a new branch or tag push event on the pipeline's associated Git repo.

## Difference between DRONE\_ and PLUGIN\_ variables

`DRONE_` variables are environment variables that are automatically set at the pipeline level. These are pipeline runtime variables, and they are available to all stages and steps in the pipeline. Many `DRONE_` variables have equivalent `CI_` or `HARNESS_` environment variables. The `DRONE_` variables are derived from Drone, which is part of Harness CI. Providing first-class support for [Drone environment variables](https://docs.drone.io/pipeline/environment/reference/) makes it easier to migrate from standalone Drone to Harness CI and provides better support for [Drone plugins](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/use-drone-plugins/run-a-drone-plugin-in-ci.md) that use those variables.

`PLUGIN_` variables represent [plugin settings](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/use-drone-plugins/plugin-step-settings-reference.md#settings). There are three ways they can be defined depending on their usage and the build infrastructure:

   * The [plugin step's settings](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/use-drone-plugins/plugin-step-settings-reference.md#settings). For example, `setting.url` becomes `PLUGIN_URL` at runtime.
   * Stage variables. For example, you can use the `PLUGIN_DRY_RUN` stage variable to [Build a Docker image without pushing](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/build-and-upload-artifacts/build-without-push.md).
   * Environment variables in Build and Push steps running on Kubernetes cluster build infrastructure.

## Codebase and trigger variables

These variables contain codebase attributes and information about how builds start (triggers). For more information about codebase attributes and expressions you can use to reference codebase attributes, go to the [CI codebase variables reference](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/codebase-configuration/built-in-cie-codebase-variables-reference).

### DRONE\_BRANCH

For branch builds and PR builds, this variable's value is the target branch for the build.

For tag push webhook triggers, this variable's value is the tag reference, such as `refs/tags/TAG_NAME`.

For manual tag builds, this variable is not applicable and can be empty.

Depending on the build type, this can be equivalent to the expressions `<+codebase.targetBranch>` or `<+codebase.branch>`.

This variable is similar to [`DRONE_COMMIT_BRANCH`](#drone_commit_branch) and [`DRONE_TARGET_BRANCH`](#drone_target_branch).

### DRONE\_BUILD\_ACTION

Only applicable to [PR webhook triggers](#webhook-triggers), this variable describes the PR event that triggered the build, such as `open` or `reopen`.

For all other build types, this variable is not applicable.

This variable is similar, but not equivalent, to the expression `<+trigger.event>`.

### DRONE\_BUILD\_EVENT

The type of event that started the build, such as `push`, `pull_request`, or `tag`.

This is similar to the expressions `<+codebase.build.type>` and `<+pipeline.triggerType>`.

### DRONE\_BUILD\_TRIGGER

Source that started the build, a user or webhook. Similar, but not equivalent, to the expressions `<pipeline.triggerType>` or `<pipeline.triggeredBy.name>`. May be empty.

### DRONE\_CALVER

Only applicable to build started by tag push webhook triggers. If the Git tag is a valid [calendar version](https://calver.org/) string, this value represents the tag as a valid calver string, such as `19.1.0-beta.20190318`.

Harness CI doesn't support `DRONE_CALVER` variations, such as `DRONE_CALVER_SHORT`.

### DRONE\_COMMIT

The full Git commit SHA for the latest commit in the branch, tag, or PR. Corresponds with the expressions `<+codebase.commitSha>` or `<+trigger.commitSha>`.

It can be the same as [`DRONE_COMMIT_SHA`](#drone_commit_sha).

:::info

For Bitbucket PR builds (manual or webhook), this expression returns a shortened SHA due to the Bitbucket webhook payload only sending shortened SHAs.

This isn't the same as the short SHA returned by `<+codebase.shortCommitSha>`.

:::

### DRONE\_COMMIT\_AFTER

This variable provides the Git commit SHA after applying a patch. It can be used in conjunction with [`DRONE_COMMIT_BEFORE`](#drone_commit_before) to create a diff.

Possible values include: a unique commit SHA, the same SHA as [`DRONE_COMMIT`](#drone_commit), empty, or all zeros.

### CI\_COMMIT\_AUTHOR/DRONE\_COMMIT\_AUTHOR

User name of the Git account associated with the build. Equivalent to the expressions `<+codebase.gitUser>` and `<+trigger.gitUser>`. Can sometimes be `null` or masked in build logs.

### DRONE\_COMMIT\_BEFORE

This variable provides the Git commit SHA before applying a patch. It can be used in conjunction with [`DRONE_COMMIT_AFTER`](#drone_commit_after) to create a diff.

Possible values include: a unique commit SHA, the same SHA as [`DRONE_COMMIT`](#drone_commit), empty, or all zeros.

### CI\_COMMIT\_BRANCH/DRONE\_COMMIT\_BRANCH

For branch builds and PR builds, this variable's value is the target branch for the build.

For tag push webhook triggers, this variable's value is the tag reference, such as `refs/tags/TAG_NAME`.

For manual tag builds, this variable is not applicable and can be empty.

Depending on the build type, this can be equivalent to the expressions `<+codebase.targetBranch>` or `<+codebase.branch>`.

This variable is similar to [`DRONE_BRANCH`](#drone_branch) and [`DRONE_TARGET_BRANCH`](#drone_target_branch).

### DRONE\_COMMIT\_LINK

Provides a link to the commit, PR, or tag in SCM.

For PR builds, this is equivalent to the expression `<+codebase.pullRequestLink>`.

### CI\_COMMIT\_MESSAGE/DRONE\_COMMIT\_MESSAGE

The latest commit message from a tag, branch, or PR. Equivalent to the expression `<+codebase.commitMessage>`.

When referenced in an `echo`, this value can cause execution errors if the message has multiple lines. The shell might attempt to execute the commit message as a command. You might need to include additional handling if you want to echo multiline commit messages.

### CI\_COMMIT\_REF/DRONE\_COMMIT\_REF

Provides a Git reference corresponding to the branch, tag, or PR. For example:

* Branch reference: `refs/heads/main`
* Tag reference: `refs/tags/v1.0.0`
* PR reference: `refs/pull/1/head`

For manual builds, this can be empty.

This is similar to `<+codebase.commitRef>`.

### CI\_COMMIT\_SHA/DRONE\_COMMIT\_SHA

The full Git commit SHA for the latest commit in the branch, tag, or PR. Corresponds with the expressions `<+codebase.commitSha>` or `<+trigger.commitSha>`.

It can be the same as [DRONE_COMMIT](#drone_commit).

### CI\_REPO\_REMOTE/DRONE\_GIT\_HTTP\_URL

Provides the HTTP(S) URL to clone a pipeline's [codebase](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/codebase-configuration/create-and-configure-a-codebase.md), such as `https://github.com/octocat/hello-world.git`.

Provides the name of the default branch for the repo associated with the build. This can be different from the build's target branch.

### CI\_REPO\_LINK/DRONE\_REPO\_LINK

Provides the standard repository link for the repo associated with the build, such as `https://github.com/octocat/hello-world`. It is equivalent to the expressions `<+codebase.repoUrl>` and `<+trigger.repoUrl>`.

`DRONE_REPO_LINK` is different from [`DRONE_GIT_HTTP_URL`](#drone_git_http_url), which is formatted to clone the repo.

### DRONE\_REPO\_NAME

Provides only the name of the repo associated with the build, such as `hello-world` in `octocat/hello-world`. By comparison, [DRONE_REPO](#drone_repo) includes both the account/organization namespace and repo name, and [`DRONE_REPO_NAMESPACE`](#drone_repo_namespace) includes only the namespace.

### DRONE\_REPO\_NAMESPACE

### DRONE\_REPO\_OWNER

Duplicate of [`DRONE_REPO_NAMESPACE`](#drone_repo_namespace).

### DRONE\_REPO\_PRIVATE

A Boolean that indicates whether the repository is private or not.

If `true`, the repo is private.

If `false`, the repo is public.

It defaults to `true` for manual builds, regardless of actual privacy.

Similar to [`DRONE_REPO_VISIBILITY`](#drone_repo_visibility).

### DRONE\_REPO\_SCM

Identifies the SCM provider, such as `Github`.

### DRONE\_REPO\_VISIBILITY

Describes repo visibility as `public`, `private`, or `internal`.

It defaults to `private` for manual builds, regardless of actual visibility.

Similar to [`DRONE_REPO_PRIVATE`](#drone_repo_private).

### DRONE\_SEMVER

Only applicable to tag builds. If the Git tag is a valid [semantic version](https://semver.org/) string, this value represents the tag as a valid semver string, such as `1.2.3-alpha.1`.

Harness CI also supports these `DRONE_SEMVER` variations:

* `DRONE_SEMVER_MAJOR`: Provides the major version number from the semver string, such as `1` in `1.2.3`.
* `DRONE_SEMVER_MINOR`: Provides the minor version number from the semver string, such as `2` in `1.2.3`.
* `DRONE_SEMVER_PATCH`: Provides the patch number from the semver string, such as `3` in `1.2.3`.
* `DRONE_SEMVER_PRERELEASE`: Provides the prelease value from the semver string, such as `alpha.1` in `1.2.3-alpha.1`.

* `DRONE_SEMVER_BUILD`: Provides the build from the semver string, such as `001` in `1.2.3+001`.
* `DRONE_SEMVER_ERROR`: Provides the semver parsing error if the tag is *not* a valid semver string.

### DRONE\_SOURCE\_BRANCH

For PR builds, this value provides the PR source branch. You can use this value along with [`DRONE_TARGET_BRANCH`](#drone_target_branch) to get the PR base and head branches.

For branch builds, this value can be the same as [`DRONE_BRANCH`](#drone_branch) or [`DRONE_COMMIT_BRANCH`](#drone_commit_branch).

For tag push webhook triggers, this variable's value is the tag reference, such as `refs/tags/TAG_NAME`

For manual tag builds, this variable can be empty.

Depending on the build type, this value can be equivalent to the expressions `<+codebase.sourceBranch>` and `<+trigger.sourceBranch>`.

This variable is similar to [`DRONE_BRANCH`](#drone_branch) and [`DRONE_COMMIT_BRANCH`](#drone_commit_branch).

### DRONE\_TAG

For tag builds, this is the tag associated with the build. It is equivalent to `<+codebase.tag>`.

### DRONE\_TARGET\_BRANCH

For branch builds and PR builds, this variable's value is the target branch for the build. You can use this value along with [`DRONE_SOURCE_BRANCH`](#drone_source_branch) to get the PR base and head branches.

For tag push webhook triggers, this variable's value is the tag reference, such as `refs/tags/TAG_NAME`.

For manual tag builds, this variable is not applicable and can be empty.

This can be equivalent to the expressions `<+codebase.targetBranch>` or `<+trigger.targetBranch>`.

This variable is similar to [`DRONE_BRANCH`](#drone_branch) and [`DRONE_COMMIT_BRANCH`](#drone_commit_branch).

## Timestamp variables

These variables provide unix timestamps.

* `CI_BUILD_CREATED`/`DRONE_BUILD_CREATED`: The unix timestamp indicating the time the build object (the execution instance) was created.
* `CI_BUILD_FINISHED`/`DRONE_BUILD_FINISHED`: Provides the unix timestamp for when the build finished. However, a running build cannot have a finish timestamp, therefore, the system always sets this value to the same as `DRONE_BUILD_CREATED`.
* `CI_BUILD_STARTED`/`DRONE_BUILD_STARTED`: Provides the unix timestamp for when the build was started by the system. Equivalent to `<+pipeline.startTs>`, and the same as `DRONE_BUILD_CREATED`.
* `DRONE_STAGE_FINISHED`: Provides the unix timestamp for when the stage ends. However, a running stage cannot have a finish timestamp, therefore, the system always sets this value to the same as `DRONE_STAGE_STARTED`.
* `DRONE_STAGE_STARTED`: Provides the unix timestamp for when a stage started.

If the pipeline's first stage is a CI stage, all timestamps are the same.

## Lite-engine environment variables
