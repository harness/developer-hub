Plugins perform predefined tasks. They are essentially templated scripts that can be written in any programming language. Plugins are also useful for integrating with other tools in your SDLC toolchain.

You can [write your own plugins](./custom_plugins.md) or use pre-built plugins, such as those in the [Drone Plugins Marketplace](https://plugins.drone.io/), the [Drone Plugins GitHub org](https://github.com/drone-plugins), and the [Harness Community GitHub org](https://github.com/harness-community).

This page highlights some useful or interesting pre-built plugins. It is not an exhaustive list of all plugins. Plugins are organized by provider/tool or purpose.

To run plugins in CI pipelines, [use Plugin steps](./run-a-drone-plugin-in-ci.md).

### Plugins for scanners

The [Harness Security Testing Orchestration module](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/sto-techref-category/security-step-settings-reference.md#harness-sto-scanner-support) provides first-class support for many security scanners. You can also use scanner plugins in [Plugin steps](./run-a-drone-plugin-in-ci.md). For example, this step uses the [SonarScanner plugin](https://plugins.drone.io/plugins/sonar-node-plugin).

```yaml
              - step:
                  type: Plugin
                  name: Plugin_1
                  identifier: Plugin_1
                  spec:
                    connectorRef: YOUR_DOCKER_CONNECTOR_ID
                    image: kytay/sonar-node-plugin ## Sonarscanner plugin image.
                    settings:
                      sonar_host:
                        from_secret: sonar_host
                      sonar_token:
                        from_secret: sonar_token
                      use_node_version: 16.18.1

## Plugins used by Harness CI

These plugins are used by built-in Harness CI steps. You don't need to run them in a separate Plugin step if you use the built-in steps. For more information about how Harness manages these plugin images, go to [Harness CI images](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/set-up-build-infrastructure/harness-ci).

| Plugin | Use | Source | Image |
| ------ | --- | ------ | ----- |
| AWS ECR | Harness uses this plugin to [build and push images to ECR](../build-and-upload-artifacts/build-and-push/build-and-push-to-ecr-step-settings.md). | [drone-docker](https://github.com/drone-plugins/drone-docker) | plugins/ecr |
| AWS S3 | Harness uses this to [upload artifacts to S3](../build-and-upload-artifacts/upload-artifacts/upload-artifacts-to-s3.md). You can also use it to [download artifacts from S3](../build-and-upload-artifacts/upload-artifacts/upload-artifacts-to-s3.md#download-artifacts-from-s3). | [drone-s3](https://github.com/drone-plugins/drone-s3) | plugins/s3 |
| Azure Container Registry | Harness uses this plugin to [build and push images to ACR](../build-and-upload-artifacts/build-and-push/build-and-push-to-acr.md). | [drone-docker](https://github.com/drone-plugins/drone-docker) | plugins/acr |
| Artifactory | Harness uses a similar plugin to [upload artifacts to JFrog Artifactory](../build-and-upload-artifacts/upload-artifacts/upload-artifacts-to-jfrog.md). | [drone-artifactory](https://github.com/harness/drone-artifactory) | plugins/artifactory |
| Bitrise | With Harness Cloud build infrastructure, you can run Bitrise Workflow Steps in the built-in [Bitrise step](./ci-bitrise-plugin.md). | N/A | N/A |
| Cache | Harness uses this plugin for [caching](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/caching-ci-data/share-ci-data-across-steps-and-stages/#use-caching-to-reduce-build-time). | [drone-meltwater-cache](https://github.com/drone-plugins/drone-meltwater-cache) | plugins/cache |
| Docker | Harness uses this plugin to [build and push images to Docker registries](../build-and-upload-artifacts/build-and-push/build-and-push-to-docker-registry.md). | [drone-docker](https://github.com/drone-plugins/drone-docker) | plugins/docker |
| Git | Harness uses this plugin image to clone a pipeline's [default codebase](../codebase-configuration/create-and-configure-a-codebase.md). You can also use it to [clone a git repository](../codebase-configuration/clone-and-process-multiple-codebases-in-the-same-pipeline.md) into your stage workspace. | [drone-git](https://github.com/drone/drone-git) | drone/drone-git |
| GitHub Actions | Harness uses this for the built-in [GitHub Actions Plugin step](./ci-github-action-step.md). | [github-actions](https://github.com/drone-plugins/github-actions). You can also run it separately in a Plugin step. | plugins/github-actions |
| Google Artifact Registry | Harness uses this plugin to [build and push to GAR](../build-and-upload-artifacts/build-and-push/build-and-push-to-gar.md). | [drone-docker](https://github.com/drone-plugins/drone-docker) | plugins/gar |
| Google Cloud Storage | Harness uses this to [upload artifacts to GCS](../build-and-upload-artifacts/upload-artifacts/upload-artifacts-to-gcs-step-settings.md). You can also use it to [download artifacts from GCS](../build-and-upload-artifacts/upload-artifacts/upload-artifacts-to-gcs-step-settings.md#download-artifacts-from-gcs). | [drone-plugins/drone-gcs](https://github.com/drone-plugins/drone-gcs) | plugins/gcs |
| Google Container Registry | Harness uses this plugin to [build and push to GCR](../build-and-upload-artifacts/build-and-push/build-and-push-to-gcr.md). | [drone-docker](https://github.com/drone-plugins/drone-docker) | plugins/gcr |
