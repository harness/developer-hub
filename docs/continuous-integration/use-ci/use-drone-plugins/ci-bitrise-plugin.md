With the **Bitrise plugin** step (also called the **Bitrise** step), you can use [Bitrise Integrations](https://bitrise.io/integrations/steps) in your Harness CI pipelines. For more information about plugins in CI pipelines, go to [Explore plugins](./explore-ci-plugins.md).

:::info

Currently, the **Bitrise plugin** step is supported for Harness Cloud build infrastructure only.

:::

## Bitrise step usage example

In the following YAML example, a Harness **Bitrise** step runs the [Android Build Bitrise step](https://bitrise.io/integrations/steps/android-build). It calls the source repo ([bitrise-steplib/bitrise-step-android-build](https://github.com/bitrise-steplib/bitrise-step-android-build)) and provides configuration parameters as described in the [Android Build README](https://github.com/bitrise-steplib/bitrise-step-android-build#android-build).

```yaml
              - step:
                  type: Bitrise
                  name: bitrise android build
                  identifier: bitrise_android_build
                  spec:
                    uses: github.com/bitrise-steplib/bitrise-step-android-build.git
                    with:
                      variant: 'debug'
                      build_type: 'apk'
```

## Bitrise step settings and specifications


import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';



<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="YAML" label="YAML editor" default>


Add a `Bitrise` step to your pipeline, for example:

```yaml
              - step:
                  type: Bitrise
                  name: bitrise android build
                  identifier: bitrise_android_build
                  spec:
                    uses: github.com/bitrise-steplib/bitrise-step-android-build.git
                    with:
                      variant: 'debug'
                      build_type: 'apk'
```

The `spec` parameters define which Bitrise Integration to use, Bitrise Integration inputs, and environment variables that you want to pass to the Integration. These are configured according to the Integration's usage specifications.

* `uses:` Specify the Bitrise Integration's source repo, such as `github.com/bitrise-steplib/bitrise-step-android-build.git`.
* `with:` If required by the Integration, provide a mapping of key-value pairs representing Integration inputs, such as `build_type: 'apk'`. For more information, go to [Settings](#settings).
* `env:` If required by the Integration, provide a mapping of environment variables to pass to the Integration. For more information, go to [Environment Variables](#environment-variables).

:::tip

If you already configured Bitrise Integrations elsewhere, you can [transfer Bitrise Integrations into Harness CI](#transfer-bitrise-integrations-into-harness-ci).

You can use [expressions](/docs/platform/variables-and-expressions/runtime-inputs) in the `with` and `env` settings. For example, `credentials: <+stage.variables.[TOKEN_SECRET]>` uses an expression referencing a [stage variable](/docs/platform/Pipelines/add-a-stage#stage-variables).

:::


</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="visual" label="Visual editor">


In the Visual editor, add the **Bitrise plugin** step to your pipeline's **Build** stage, and then populate the settings. **Name** and **Uses** are required. Refer to each Bitrise Integration's documentation for information about **Settings** and **Environment Variables**.


</TabItem>
</Tabs>


### Name

Enter a name summarizing the step's purpose. Harness automatically assigns an **Id** ([Entity Identifier Reference](../../../platform/references/entity-identifier-reference.md)) based on the **Name**. You can change the **Id**.

The **Description** is optional.

### Uses

Specify the repo of the Bitrise Integration that you want to use, for example `github.com/bitrise-steplib/bitrise-step-android-build.git`.

### Settings

If required by the Integration, add key-value pairs representing Integration inputs, such as `build_type: 'apk'`. Refer to the Integration's usage specifications for details about specific inputs available for the Integration that you want to use.

:::tip

* Settings keys can be supplied as fixed values or runtime input, and values can be supplied as fixed values, runtime input, or expressions. For more information, go to [Fixed values, runtime inputs, and expressions](/docs/platform/variables-and-expressions/runtime-inputs).
* In the Visual editor, there are separate fields for keys and values. For example, to specify `build_type: 'apk'` in the Visual editor, you would enter `build_type` in the key field and `apk` in the value field.

:::

### Environment Variables

If required by the Integration, add key-value pairs representing environment variables that you want to pass to the Integration, such as `GITHUB_TOKEN: <+secrets.getValue("github_pat")>`. Note that these are *incoming* environment variables that you're passing to the Bitrise Integration, which are separate from *outgoing* environment variables that are output by the Integration.Refer to the Integration's usage specifications for details about specific environment variables relevant to the Integration that you want to use.

:::tip

* You can use [fixed values, runtime inputs, or expressions](/docs/platform/variables-and-expressions/runtime-inputs) for environment variable values. For example, `<+stage.variables.[TOKEN_SECRET]>` is a variable expression [stage variable](/docs/platform/Pipelines/add-a-stage#stage-variables).
* In the Visual editor, there are separate fields for keys and values. For example, to specify `GITHUB_TOKEN: <+secrets.getValue("github_pat")>` in the Visual editor, you would enter `GITHUB_TOKEN` in the key field and `<+secrets.getValue("github_pat")>` in the value field.

### Timeout

You can set the timeout limit for the step. Once the timeout limit is reached, the step fails and pipeline execution continues. To set skip conditions or failure handling for steps, go to:

* [Step Skip Condition settings](../../../platform/pipelines/w_pipeline-steps-reference/step-skip-condition-settings.md)
* [Step Failure Strategy settings](../../../platform/pipelines/w_pipeline-steps-reference/step-failure-strategy-settings.md)

## Transfer Bitrise Integrations into Harness CI

If you already configured Bitrise Integrations elsewhere, the Bitrise `inputs` mapping is equivalent to the Harness Bitrise plugin step's `spec: with:` mapping. The following table compares Bitrise `inputs` specification with the equivalent Harness `with` specification.

<table>
<tr>
<td> Bitrise `inputs` </td> <td> Harness `with` </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```
    inputs:
    - variant: debug
    - build_type: apk
```

</td>
<td>

```yaml
      with:
        variant: 'debug'
        build_type: 'apk'
```
