A plugin is a Docker container that performs a predefined task. Plugins are essentially templated scripts that can be written in any programming language. The Drone community maintains an [extensive library](https://plugins.drone.io/) of plugins for specific CI workflows. You can customize and extend your build processes using existing plugins or [write your own](https://harness.io/blog/continuous-integration/write-first-plugin-for-cie/).

This topic describes how to set up and run plugins in your CI Pipelines.


### Before You Begin

To install and run a plugin, you need the following:

* A familiarity with basic Harness CI concepts:
	+ [CI Pipeline Quickstart](../../ci-quickstarts/ci-pipeline-quickstart.md)
	+ [Learn Harness' Key Concepts](../../../getting-started/learn-harness-key-concepts.md)
* A build infrastructure and Delegate to run builds:
	+ [Set Up Build Infrastructure](/docs/category/set-up-build-infrastructure)
	+ [Install a Kubernetes Delegate](../../../platform/2_Delegates/delegate-guide/install-a-kubernetes-delegate.md) *or* [Install a Docker Delegate](../../../platform/2_Delegates/delegate-install-docker/install-a-docker-delegate.md)
* A CI Pipeline with a Build Stage to run the plugin:
	+ [CI Stage Settings](../../ci-technical-reference/ci-stage-settings.md)
* You should create text secrets for any sensitive information required by the plugin, such as a password or Personal Access Token. You'll need to reference the IDs for any secrets when you set up the Plugin Step.
	+ [Add and Reference Text Secrets](../../../platform/6_Security/2-add-use-text-secrets.md)

### Workflow Description

The following steps describe the high-level workflow:

1. Go to the Pipeline and open the Build step where you want to run the plugin.
2. In the Execution tab, click **Add step** and select **Plugin**.
3. Enter the following:
	1. **Name:** A unique, descriptive name.
	2. **Container Registry:** A Connector to the image registry (such as Docker Hub) of the plugin image.
	3. **Image:** The full image name, such as`dockerhubusername/my-plugin:2.3.1`. The Step uses the latest image if you don't specify a tag.
	4. Under Optional Configuration > Settings, add any other settings that are required as specified in the docs for the specific plugin.
4. Click **Apply Changes** to apply your Stage settings, then **Save** to save the updated Pipeline
5. Run the updated Pipeline and check the log output to verify that the Plugin Step works as intended.

### Simple Example: Download a File

This example describes how to run the Drone Downloads plugin, which downloads an archive to your build infrastructure. You can use the following workflow to implement any plugin.

1. Go to the [Drone Plugins Hub](https://plugins.drone.io/) and read the description for the specific plugin. The description should indicate the plugin image and the required settings.  
The [Download plugin doc](https://plugins.drone.io/plugins/download) shows the image to use (`plugins/download`) and the settings that the plugin supports: `source`, `destination`, `username`, `password`, and so on.
2. Go to the Build Stage in a CI Pipeline. In the Execute tab, add a **Plugin** step.
3. Configure the Step as follows.
* **Name:** A unique, descriptive name.
* **Container Registry:** A Connector to Docker Hub.
* **Image:** The plugin image --in this case, `plugins/download`
* Under Optional Configuration, add the following settings:
	+ `source` = The artifact to download.
	+ `destination` = Save the downloaded artifact to this file.
	+ `username` = A valid username for the Git provider.
	+ `password` = The ID of the text secret that contains the Git provider password, using the convention described [here](../../../platform/6_Security/2-add-use-text-secrets.md#step-3-reference-the-encrypted-text-by-identifier). For example: `<+secrets.getValue("mygithubpersonalaccesstoken")>`

4. Click **Apply Changes** to apply your Stage settings, then **Save** to save the updated Pipeline
5. Run the updated Pipeline and check the log output to verify that the Plugin Step works as intended.

### Drone Plugin YAML and CI Step YAML

You can use the examples in [Drone plugin descriptions](https://plugins.drone.io/) to configure a Plugin Step in the Pipeline YAML editor. The formats are slightly different, but close enough that translating Drone Plugin definitions to Harness CI is fairly simple. You can see additional examples in [this blog post](https://harness.io/blog/continuous-integration/github-actions-support-harness-ci/).

#### Text Secrets in Drone vs. Harness CI

The following snippets illustrate the different ways that Drone and Harness CI handle text secrets. See [Add and Use Text Secrets](../../../platform/6_Security/2-add-use-text-secrets.md).

Note that the CI definition includes a few additional fields and that some fields use different formats.


##### Example from Drone Download description

```
steps:- name: download    image: plugins/download  settings:    username:     from_secret: username    password:      from_secret: password    source: https://github.com/drone/drone-cli/releases/download/v0.8.5/drone_linux_amd64.tar.gz                                  
```

##### Equivalent definition in Harness CI Pipeline

```
  - step:        type: Plugin        name: download-drone        identifier: downloaddrone        spec:            connectorRef: mygithubconnector            image: plugins/download            privileged: false            settings:                username: <+secrets.getValue("myusernamesecret")>                password: <+secrets.getValue("mypasswordsecret")>                source: https://github.com/drone/drone-cli/releases/download/v0.8.5/drone_linux_amd64.tar.gz
```


#### Define Nested and List Settings

You can specify nested and list settings in a Pipeline YAML definition, as shown here. It's easier to define complex settings in the YAML editor than the UI.


```
settings:  
  mynestedsetting:  
    nextlevel:   
      varname: 100  
  mylistsetting:  
   - itemone   
   - itemtwo
```
The settings appear in the UI like this:
