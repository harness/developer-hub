[Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions) is a GitHub feature that enables you to automate various event-driven activities in GitHub, such as cloning a repository, generating Docker images, and testing scripts.

Harness CI supports launching GitHub Actions as part of a Pipeline Stage using the **Plugin** step.

You simply use the GitHub Actions Drone Plugin, [plugins/github-actions](https://github.com/drone-plugins/github-actions), in the **Plugin** step, and then replicate the GitHub Action settings.

The Github Actions Drone Plugin runs your GitHub Actions in the background using [nektos/act](https://github.com/nektos/act).

In this topic, we cover using GitHub Actions in the Plugin step with one of the several GitHub Actions listed in [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?category=&query=&type=actions&verification=).


### Before You Begin

* [CI Pipeline Quickstart](../../ci-quickstarts/ci-pipeline-quickstart.md)
* [CI Stage Settings](../../ci-technical-reference/ci-stage-settings.md)
* [Set Up Build Infrastructure](/docs/category/set-up-build-infrastructure)
* [Learn Harness' Key Concepts](../../../getting-started/learn-harness-key-concepts.md)

### Step 1: Create the CI Stage

In your Harness Pipeline, click Add Stage, and then click CI.

### Step 2: Add the Codebase

In Connector, select an existing Connector to your codebase repo, or create a new one. See [Code Repo Connectors](/docs/category/code-repo-connectors).

You can see the URL for the repo account below **Repository Name**. Don't add the URL into Repository Name.

In Repository Name, enter the name of the repo containing the codebase.

For example, if the account URL is `https://github.com/mycompany` and the repo in that account is `myapp`, enter `myapp` in the **Repository Name**.

### Step 3: Define the Build Farm Infrastructure

In the CI stage Infrastructure, define the build farm for the codebase.

The following example uses a Kubernetes cluster build farm. You can use AWS for your build infrastructure as well. See [Set Up an AWS VM Build Infrastructure](../set-up-build-infrastructure/set-up-an-aws-vm-build-infrastructure.md). 

In **Select a Kubernetes Cluster**, select, or create, a Kubernetes Connector. See [Kubernetes Cluster Connector Settings Reference](../../../platform/7_Connectors/ref-cloud-providers/kubernetes-cluster-connector-settings-reference.md). This Connector connects Harness to the cluster to use as the build farm.

In **Namespace**, enter the Kubernetes namespace to use. You can use a Runtime Input (`<+input>`) or expression also. See [Runtime Inputs](../../../platform/20_References/runtime-inputs.md).

See [Define a Kubernetes Cluster Build Infrastructure](../set-up-build-infrastructure/set-up-a-kubernetes-cluster-build-infrastructure.md) for more information.

### Step 4: Add the Plugin step

In the stage's Execution, click **Add step**, select **Plugin**.

The Plugin settings appear.

Enter the following settings:


|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Name** | Enter a unique name for the step. |
| **Description** | Harness automatically generates a unique ID for the step. |
| **Container Registry** | Select or create a Harness Connector for the container registry. |
| **Image** | Enter the name of the Drone Plugin: `plugins/github-actions`. This Plugin allows running GitHub Action in CI. |
| **Privileged** | The Drone Plugin uses [nektos/act](https://github.com/nektos/act) to run GitHub Actions in CI. It requires DIND (docker-in-docker) to run your images. Hence, the **Privileged** attribute needs to be enabled to run with escalated permissions. |
| **Settings** | Replicate the GitHub Action attributes under **Settings**. See the following example. | 

##### Settings Example

Replicate the GitHub Action attributes under Settings.  For example:

* `name`: It refers to the GitHub repo of action along with branch or tag.
* `with`: It is a map with key and value as strings. These are inputs to the GitHub Actions.
* `env`: Environment variables passed to the GitHub Actions.

For example, for the Upload Cloud Storage Action, the attributes are as follows: 

* `uses`: google-github-actions/upload-cloud-storage@main
* `with`: 
   * `path: pom.xml`
   * `destination`: `cie-demo-pipeline/github-action`
   * `credentials`: `<+stage.variables.GCP_SECRET_KEY_BASE64>`

The `<+stage.variables.GCP_SECRET_KEY_BASE64>` setting uses a Stage variable and a Harness Secret. See [Add a Stage](../../../platform/8_Pipelines/add-a-stage.md).

Here's an example:

For the step settings on CI Plugins, see [Plugin Step Settings](../../ci-technical-reference/plugin-step-settings-reference.md).


##### Private Actions

If you are trying to use an action composite that is located in a private repository, you will need to set a `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable on the plugin step. Make sure the token has pull permissions to the target repository.

```
- step:
   type: Plugin
   name: private action
   identifier: private_action
   spec:
     connectorRef: dockerhub
     image: plugins/github-actions
     privileged: true
     settings:
       uses: myorg/private-action-step@v1
     envVariables:
       GITHUB_TOKEN: <+secrets.getValue("github_pat")>
```

### Step 5: View the Results

Save the Pipeline and click **Run**. 

You can see the logs for the GitHub GCP Upload Action in the Pipeline as it runs.

### Configure As Code: YAML

To configure your pipeline as YAML in CI, go to Harness **Pipeline Studio** and select **YAML**. The following is a working example of GitHub Action Cloud Storage Upload to GCP in CI. Modify the YAML attributes such as name, identifiers, codebase, connector ref, and environment variables based on your pipeline requirements.


```
pipeline:  
    name: gcp-upload-github-action # Configure your Pipeline name  
    identifier: gcpuploadgithubaction # Configure your Pipeline identifier  
    projectIdentifier: Demo_CI_pipelines # Configure your Project identifier  
    orgIdentifier: default # Configure your Organization  
    tags: {}  
    stages:  
        - stage:  
              identifier: gcp_upload_success_gha # Configure your Stage identifier  
              name: stage 1  
              type: CI  
              variables:   
                  - name: GCP_SECRET_KEY_BASE64 # Configure your Secret Key Name  
                    type: Secret  
                    value: gcpbase64secret # Configure your Secret Key Value  
              spec:  
                  execution:  
                      steps:  
                          - step:  
                                identifier: gcsuploader # Configure your step identifier name  
                                name: step one # Configure your step name  
                                type: Plugin  
                                spec:  
                                    connectorRef: dockerhub  
                                    image: plugins/github-actions  
                                    privileged: true  
                                    settings: # Configure your plugins Settings configuration  
                                        uses: google-github-actions/upload-cloud-storage@main  
                                        with:  
                                            path: pom.xml  
                                            destination: cie-demo-pipeline/github-action  
                                            credentials: <+stage.variables.GCP_SECRET_KEY_BASE64>  
                  infrastructure: # Configure your Infrastructure Settings  
                      type: KubernetesDirect  
                      spec:  
                          connectorRef: buildfarm  
                          namespace: cie-demo-pipeline  
    properties:  
        ci:  
            codebase: # Configure your Codebase  
                connectorRef: githubautouser  
                repoName: springboot  
                build:  
                    type: branch  
                    spec:  
                        branch: ci-autouser
```
