You can use [Background steps](../../ci-technical-reference/background-step-settings.md) to maintain long-running services over the duration of a stage. For detailed examples, check out these tutorials:

* [Run Sauce Connect Proxy as a Background step](/tutorials/ci-pipelines/test/saucelabs-proxy)
* [Run LocalStack as a Background step](/tutorials/ci-pipelines/test/localstack)

You can also manage dependencies through [caching and shared volumes](../caching-ci-data/share-ci-data-across-steps-and-stages.md).
