This topic explains how to add a Build and Push to [Google Container Registry](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry) (GCR) step to a CI pipeline.

These steps assume you're familiar with creating CI pipelines. If you haven't created a pipeline before, try this tutorial to [get started for free with the fastest CI on the planet](https://developer.harness.io/tutorials/build-code/fastest-ci).

## Add the Build and Push to GCR step

1. Go to **Pipelines** and create a new pipeline or edit an existing pipeline.
2. If your pipeline doesn't already have a **Build** stage, select **Add Stage**, and then select **Build**.
3. On the **Build** stage's **Infrastructure** tab, configure the build infrastructure. For example, you can [set up a Kubernetes cluster build infrastructure](../set-up-build-infrastructure/set-up-a-kubernetes-cluster-build-infrastructure.md).
4. In the **Build** stage's **Execution** tab, select **Add Step**, select **Add Step** again, and then select **Build and Push to GCR** from the Step Library.
5. Configure the [Build and Push to GCR step settings](../../ci-technical-reference/build-and-push-to-gcr-step-settings.md).
6. Select **Apply Changes** to save the step, and then select **Save** to save the pipeline.

## Run the pipeline

Select **Run Pipeline** to run your pipeline. Depending on your pipeline's codebase configuration, you may need to select a Git branch or tag to use for the build.

While the build runs, you can monitor the **Build and Push to GCR** step logs.

If the build succeeds, you can find your pushed image on GCR.
