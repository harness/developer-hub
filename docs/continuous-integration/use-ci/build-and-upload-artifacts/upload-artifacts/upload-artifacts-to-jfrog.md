Use the **Upload Artifacts to JFrog Artifactory** step in your CI pipelines to [upload artifacts](../build-and-upload-an-artifact/#upload-artifacts) to [JFrog Artifactory](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/JFrog+Artifactory) *non-Docker* registries. 
To learn how to push Docker images to JFrog *Docker* registry, see [Build and Push to JFrog Docker registries](../build-and-push/build-and-push-to-docker-jfrog.md).


## Add the Upload Artifacts step

Add the **Upload Artifacts to JFrog Artifactory** step to your pipeline's [Build stage](../../set-up-build-infrastructure/ci-stage-settings.md).

```yaml
  - step:
      type: ArtifactoryUpload
      name: ArtifactoryUpload_1
      identifier: ArtifactoryUpload_1
      spec:
        connectorRef: YOUR_ARTIFACTORY_CONNECTOR_ID
        target: groupId/artifactId/version
        sourcePath: path/to/source
```

The **Upload Artifacts to JFrog Artifactory** step has the following settings. Depending on the build infrastructure, some settings might be unavailable or optional.

### Name, Description, Tags

* **Name**: A name for the step. Harness automatically assigns an **ID** ([Entity Identifier](/docs/platform/references/entity-identifier-reference.md)) based on the **Name**. You can change the **ID** until the step is saved, then it is locked.
* **Description** and **Tags**: Optional metadata.

### Artifactory Connector

Select the [Harness Artifactory connector](/docs/platform/connectors/cloud-providers/ref-cloud-providers/artifactory-connector-settings-reference) to use for this upload. The JFrog Account associated with the connector must have read/write permission.

This step supports Artifactory connectors that use either anonymous or username and password authentication.

If the connector uses username and password authentication, the `PLUGIN_USERNAME` and `PLUGIN_PASSWORD` used by this step are derived from the selected Artifactory connector.

### Target, Source Path

The **Target** is the target path in the JFrog Artifactory registry. This is a target repository name relative to the server URL in the connector. If `pom.xml` is not present, then the **Target** must be a full path to an artifacts folder, such as `groupId/artifactId/version`.

**Source Path** is a path, relative to the stage workspace, to the artifact file/folder that you want to upload. The root stage workspace directory is `/harness`.

If you want to upload a compressed file, you must use a [Run step](../../run-step-settings.md) to compress the artifact before uploading it.

### Additional container settings

Settings specific to containers are not applicable when using the step in a stage with self-managed VM or Harness Cloud build infrastructure.

#### Run as User

Specify the user ID to use to run all processes in the pod if running in containers. For more information, go to [Set the security context for a pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/#set-the-security-context-for-a-pod).

#### Set container resources

Set maximum resource limits for the resources used by the container at runtime:

* **Limit Memory:** The maximum memory that the container can use. You can express memory as a plain integer or as a fixed-point number using the suffixes `G` or `M`. You can also use the power-of-two equivalents `Gi` and `Mi`. The default is `500Mi`.
* **Limit CPU:** The maximum number of cores that the container can use. CPU limits are measured in CPU units. Fractional requests are allowed; for example, you can specify one hundred millicpu as `0.1` or `100m`. The default is `400m`. For more information, go to [Resource units in Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#resource-units-in-kubernetes).

### Timeout

Set the timeout limit for the step. Once the timeout limit is reached, the step fails and pipeline execution continues. To set skip conditions or failure handling for steps, go to:

* [Step Skip Condition settings](/docs/platform/pipelines/step-skip-condition-settings.md)
* [Step Failure Strategy settings](/docs/platform/pipelines/failure-handling/define-a-failure-strategy-on-stages-and-steps)

### JFrog CLI flags

You can use [stage variables](/docs/platform/pipelines/add-a-stage/#stage-variables) to pass the following optional flags supported by the [JFrog CLI](https://docs.jfrog-applications.jfrog.io/jfrog-applications/jfrog-cli):

- `PLUGIN_BUILD_NAME`: Specify the name of the build associated with the uploaded artifacts in JFrog Artifactory. Use this flag to organize and track artifacts by their build name.

   ```yaml
           variables:
             - name: PLUGIN_BUILD_NAME
               type: String
               description: "Name of the build associated with the uploaded artifacts in JFrog"
               required: false
               value: <+pipeline.name> # You can use an expression or a fixed value.
   ```

- `PLUGIN_BUILD_NUMBER`: Specify the build number associated with the uploaded artifacts in JFrog Artifactory. Use this flag to version and identify different builds of the same project or component.

   ```yaml
           variables:
             - name: PLUGIN_BUILD_NUMBER
               type: String
               description: "Build number associated with the uploaded artifacts in JFrog"
               required: false
               value: <+pipeline.executionID> # You can use an expression or a fixed value.
   ```
   
- `JFROG_CLI_HOME_DIR`: to change the folder in which .jfrog will be created, to a path that is writable by the user running the container.

   ```yaml
           variables:
             - name: JFROG_CLI_HOME_DIR
               type: String
               description: "Change the path of where the JFrog is to a writable directory"
               required: false
               value: /harness/temp # the path to the directory that is writable.
   ```

## Publish Build metadata to JFrog Artifactory Artifact

The built-in **Upload Artifacts to JFrog Artifactory** step uses the [Artifactory Drone plugin](https://github.com/harness/drone-artifactory). You can used the plugin directly in case there is some configuration or flags that are not supported natively in the built-in step.

To enable the publication of build information, you must set the `publish_build_info` to `true`. This feature requires both `build_name` and `build_number` to be specified, as they are essential for tracking and organizing builds in Artifactory. You can also set `targetProps` to pass additional custom properties. 


For example:

```yaml
              - step:
                  type: Plugin
                  name: plugin
                  identifier: plugin
                  spec:
                    connectorRef: account.harnessImage
                    image: plugins/artifactory
                    settings:
                      access_token: YOUR_JFROG_TOKEN
                      url: YOUR_JFROG_ARTIFACTORY_URL
                      source: /path/to/source
                      target: /path/to/target
                      build_name: <+pipeline.identifier> # You can use an expression or a fixed value.
                      build_number: <+pipeline.sequenceId> # You can use an expression or a fixed value.
                      publish_build_info: true
                      targetProps: key1=123;projectName=ExampleApp # Optional metadata/properties
```

## Post artifacts to the Artifacts tab

When using the built-in steps for Artifacts, the artifacts are automatically posted to the Artifacts tab of a Build execution by Harness. 

If you're publishing artifacts through Plugin or Run steps, you can use the [Artifact Metadata Publisher plugin](https://github.com/drone-plugins/artifact-metadata-publisher) to publish artifacts to the [Artifacts tab](../../viewing-builds.md). To do this, add a [Plugin step](../../use-drone-plugins/plugin-step-settings-reference.md) after the **Upload Artifacts to JFrog Artifactory** step.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Visual" label="Visual">

Configure the **Plugin** step settings as follows:

* **Name:** Enter a name.
* **Container Registry:** Select a Docker connector.
* **Image:** Enter `plugins/artifact-metadata-publisher`.
* **Settings:** Add the following two settings as key-value pairs.
  * `file_urls`: Provide a URL to the artifact that was uploaded in the **Upload Artifacts to JFrog Artifactory** step. If you uploaded multiple artifacts, you can provide a list of URLs.
  * `artifact_file`: Provide any `.txt` file name, such as `artifact.txt` or `url.txt`. This is a required setting that Harness uses to store the artifact URL and display it on the **Artifacts** tab. This value is not the name of your uploaded artifact, and it has no relationship to the artifact object itself.

</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="YAML" label="YAML" default>

Add a `Plugin` step that uses the `artifact-metadata-publisher` plugin.

```yaml
               - step:
                  type: Plugin
                  name: publish artifact metadata
                  identifier: publish_artifact_metadata
                  spec:
                    connectorRef: account.harnessImage
                    image: plugins/artifact-metadata-publisher
                    settings:
                      file_urls: https://complete/url/to/artifact/on/jfrog
                      artifact_file: artifact.txt
```

* `connectorRef`: Use the built-in Docker connector (`account.harness.Image`) or specify your own Docker connector.
* `image`: Must be `plugins/artifact-metadata-publisher`.
* `file_urls`: Provide the URL to the artifact that was uploaded in the **Upload Artifacts to JFrog Artifactory** step. If you uploaded multiple artifacts, you can provide a list of URLs.
* `artifact_file`: Provide any `.txt` file name, such as `artifact.txt` or `url.txt`. This is a required setting that Harness uses to store the artifact URL and display it on the **Artifacts** tab. This value is not the name of your uploaded artifact, and it has no relationship to the artifact object itself.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Build logs and artifact files

When you run the pipeline, you can observe the step logs on the [build details page](../../viewing-builds.md).

![](../static/upload-artifacts-to-jfrog-520.png)

If the Upload Artifacts step succeeds, you can find the artifact in your JFrog repo.

![](../static/upload-artifacts-to-jfrog-522.png)

If you used the Artifact Metadata Publisher, you can find a link to the artifact on the [Artifacts tab](../../viewing-builds.md).

:::tip

On the **Artifacts** tab, select the step name to expand the list of artifact links associated with that step.

If your pipeline has multiple steps that upload artifacts, use the dropdown menu on the **Artifacts** tab to switch between lists of artifacts uploaded by different steps.
