This topic provides settings to upload artifacts to [JFrog Artifactory](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/JFrog+Artifactory).

The following steps run SSH commands and push the artifacts to JFrog Artifactory.

### Before you Begin

* [CI Pipeline Quickstart](../../ci-quickstarts/ci-pipeline-quickstart.md)
* [CI Stage Settings](../../ci-technical-reference/ci-stage-settings.md)
* [Set Up Build Infrastructure](/docs/category/set-up-build-infrastructure)
* [Learn Harness' Key Concepts](../../../getting-started/learn-harness-key-concepts.md)

### Step 1: Create the CI Stage

In your Harness Pipeline, click **Add Stage**, and then click CI.

### Step 2: Define the Build Farm Infrastructure

In the CI stage Infrastructure, define the build farm for the codebase. See [Define Kubernetes Cluster Build Infrastructure](../set-up-build-infrastructure/set-up-a-kubernetes-cluster-build-infrastructure.md).

### Step 3: Configure the Run Step

In the stage's Execution step, select **Run**. The Run step executes one or more commands on a container image. See [Configure Run Step](../../ci-technical-reference/configure-service-dependency-step-settings.md). 

### Step 4: Upload Artifacts to JFrog Artifactory

In the CI Artifact, select **Upload Artifacts to JFrog Artifactory**.

In this step, configure the Harness Artifactory Connector, enter the source file/path, and the target path. 

The JFrog Account associated with the Connector must have read/write permission. See [Connector Settings Reference](../../../platform/7_Connectors/ref-cloud-providers/artifactory-connector-settings-reference.md).

For the step Settings, see [Upload Artifacts to JFrog Artifactory](../../ci-technical-reference/upload-artifacts-to-jfrog-artifactory-step-settings.md).

### Step 5: View the Results

Save the Pipeline and click **Run**. 

You can see the logs for the Run and Upload step in the Pipeline as it runs.
