This topic provides settings to upload artifacts to [JFrog Artifactory](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/JFrog+Artifactory).

The following steps run SSH commands and push the artifacts to JFrog Artifactory.

### Before you Begin

* [CI pipeline tutorials](../../ci-quickstarts/ci-pipeline-quickstart.md)
* [CI Stage Settings](../../ci-technical-reference/ci-stage-settings.md)
* [Set Up Build Infrastructure](/docs/category/set-up-build-infrastructure)
* [Learn Harness' Key Concepts](../../../getting-started/learn-harness-key-concepts.md)

### Step 1: Create the CI Stage

In your Harness Pipeline, click **Add Stage**, and then click CI.

### Step 2: Define the Build Farm Infrastructure

In the CI stage Infrastructure, define the build farm for the codebase. See [Set up a Kubernetes cluster build infrastructure](../set-up-build-infrastructure/set-up-a-kubernetes-cluster-build-infrastructure.md).

### Step 3: Configure the Run Step

In the stage's Execution tab, add a **Run** step. The Run step executes one or more commands on a container image. See [Run step settings](../../ci-technical-reference/configure-run-tests-step-settings.md).

### Step 4: Upload Artifacts to JFrog Artifactory

Add an **Upload Artifacts to JFrog Artifactory** step.

To configure this step, select the Harness Artifactory connector, enter the source file/path, and the target path. For more information about these settings, go to the [Upload Artifacts to JFrog Artifactory step settings reference](../../ci-technical-reference/upload-artifacts-to-jfrog-artifactory-step-settings.md).

The JFrog Account associated with the connector must have read/write permission. For more information, go to the [Artifactory connector settings reference](../../../platform/7_Connectors/ref-cloud-providers/artifactory-connector-settings-reference.md).

### Step 5: View the Results

Save the Pipeline and click **Run**.

You can see the logs for the Run and Upload step in the pipeline as it runs.
