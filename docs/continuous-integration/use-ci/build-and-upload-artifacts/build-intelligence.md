Build Intelligence is part of [Harness CI Intelligence](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/harness-ci-intelligence), a suite of features in Harness CI designed to improve build times. By storing these outputs remotely and retrieving them when inputs haven't changed, Build Intelligence avoids unnecessary rebuilds, significantly accelerating the build process and enhancing efficiency.

Build Intelligence is currently available for **Gradle**, **Bazel** and **Maven** build tools. Regardless of the programming language used in your projects, as long as you're building with a supported build tool, you can leverage Build Intelligence to optimize your builds.

:::tip Build Intelligence with Maven (Beta)
**Build Intelligence is now available in beta** for the Maven build tool (version 3.9+). To join the beta program, please contact [Harness Support](https://support.harness.io) or your account representative.
:::

:::info
* Build Intelligence is now Generally Available (GA). 
* Build Intelligence is enabled by default for newly created CI stages. This is configurable in [CI default settings](/docs/platform/settings/default-settings.md#continuous-integration).
* Build Intelligence currently supports Linux only (AMD and ARM). 
* Build Intelligence currently supports Cloud and Kubernetes Build infrastructures only.

## Using Build Intelligence
Build Intelligence seamlessly integrates into your workflow without requiring changes to your build commands. Harness automatically detects supported build tools in your pipeline and injects the necessary configurations into the relevant files within the build workspace. This ensures Build Intelligence optimizes your builds during Gradle or Bazel operations performed in `Test` or `Run` steps. 

To enable Build Intelligence, use the UI editor to enable the stage property `Build Intelligence` in Build stage overview tab. Alternatively, it can be enabled from YAML editor as shown below.


Below is an example of a CI stage using Build Intelligence: 

```YAML
- stage:
    identifier: build
    name: build
    type: CI
    spec:
      cloneCodebase: true
      buildIntelligence: 
        enabled: true # Build intelligence enabled
      execution:
        steps:
          - step:
              type: Action
              name: Set up Gradle
              identifier: Set_up_Gradle
              spec:
                uses: gradle/gradle-build-action@v2
                with:
                  gradle-version: "8.5"
          - step:
              type: Run
              name: build
              identifier: build
              spec:
                shell: Sh
                command: ./gradlew build --profile  # '--profile' is optional but advised for gradle
```

You can also enable or disable Build Intelligence based on an expression directly in the YAML. For example, you can conditionally set whether Build Intelligence is on or off using a pipeline variable expression like `<+pipeline.variables.someVar>`.

The cache storage limit depends on your subscription plan type. Please visit [Subscriptions and licenses](/docs/continuous-integration/get-started/ci-subscription-mgmt.md#usage-limits) page to learn more about usage limits.

Harness doesn't limit the number of caches you can store, but, once you reach your storage limit, Harness continues to save new caches by automatically evicting old caches.

The cache retention window is 15 days, which resets whenever a cache is updated.

  </TabItem>


  <TabItem value="Self Hosted" label="Self Hosted" default>
  :::info
   - Build Intelligence is only supported for Kubernetes on self-hosted build infrastructure. 
   - By default, Build Intelligence uses port 8082, and downloads the Build Intelligence plugin from Maven Central. You can change the default behaviour in [CI default settings](/docs/platform/settings/default-settings.md#continuous-integration).
  :::

  - When using a Build Intelligence with self-hosted infrastructure, an S3-compatible bucket is required for cache storage. Please visit [configure default S3-compatible object storage](/docs/platform/settings/default-settings.md#continuous-integration) for more information.
  - By default, the Build Intelligence step configures a proxy on port 8082. However, for self-hosted setups, you can configure the port by setting the stage variable `CACHE_SERVICE_HTTPS_BIND`, or in [CI default settings](/docs/platform/settings/default-settings.md#continuous-integration).

Example Pipeline YAML:

```YAML
pipeline:
  projectIdentifier: YOUR_PROJECT_ID
  orgIdentifier: default
  properties:
    ci:
      codebase:
        connectorRef: YOUR_CONNECTOR_REF
        build: <+input>
  stages:
    - stage:
        name: build
        identifier: build
        type: CI
        spec:
          cloneCodebase: true
          caching:
            enabled: false
          buildIntelligence:
            enabled: true
          infrastructure:
            type: KubernetesDirect
            spec:
              connectorRef: k8
              namespace: harness-delegate-ng
              os: Linux
          execution:
            steps:
              - step:
                  type: Run
                  name: Run_1
                  identifier: Run_1
                  spec:
                    connectorRef: YOUR_IMAGE_REGISTRY_CONNECTOR
                    image: gradle:8.1.1-jdk17
                    shell: Sh
                    command: |-
                      ./gradlew build
        variables:
          - name: MAVEN_URL
            type: String
            required: false
            value: https://your-artifactory-domain/artifactory/your-repository/
          - name: CACHE_SERVICE_HTTPS_BIND
            type: String
            description: "Custom port for self-hosted Build Intelligence proxy"
            required: false
            value: "8284"  # Example custom port
  identifier: YOUR_PIPELINE_ID
  name: YOUR_PIPELINE_NAME
```

  - By default, the Build Intelligence plugin is downloaded from Maven Central. If your environment does not have access to Maven Central or you prefer using a custom Maven repository, you can configure this by setting a stage variable named `MAVEN_URL`, or in [CI default settings](/docs/platform/settings/default-settings.md#continuous-integration). See [Build Intelligence plugin](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/io.harness/gradle-cache/overview )

### How does Build Intelligence work 
Harness auto-detects supported build tools (Gradle and Bazel). It auto injects required configuration to appropriate files on the build workspace. This will allow Build Intelligence to automatically optimize your builds when bazel/gradle operation are done in `Test` or `Run` steps. 

#### Gradle Config
When using gradle, Harness creates an init.gradle file in `~/.gradle/init.d` or `$GRADLE_HOME/init.d` or `$GRADLE_USER_HOME/init.d` folder if not found, with the required configuration. 

#### Bazel Config
When using bazel, Harness create a ~/.bazelrc file (if it does not exist), with the required configuration. 

The config will look like:
`build --remote_cache=http://endpoint:port/cache/bazel (endpoint is localhost:8082)`

#### Maven Config
For Maven builds, the following configuration files are injected into the environment:

`.mvn/maven-build-cache-config.xml`

`.mvn/extensions.xml`

`~/.m2/settings.xml`

There are two ways to apply settings.xml:

- Maven installation-wide: `${maven.home}/conf/settings.xml`

- User-specific: `${user.home}/.m2/settings.xml`

These configurations enable build caching and repository access based on your pipelineâ€™s setup.

### Using a Private Maven Repository for Build Intelligence Extensions

If your environment restricts access to Maven Central, you can configure Build Intelligence to download required extensions (like the Maven build cache extension) from your private or third-party artifact registry.

This support is built-in and requires the following:

1. Upload Required Maven Artifacts
Ensure the following artifacts are available in your private Maven repository under the correct path structure (i.e., `org/apache/maven/extensions/maven-build-cache-extension/1.2.0/`):

- [maven-build-cache-extension-1.2.0.pom](https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/apache/maven/extensions/maven-build-cache-extension/1.2.0/maven-build-cache-extension-1.2.0.pom)

- [maven-build-cache-extension-1.2.0.jar](https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/apache/maven/extensions/maven-build-cache-extension/1.2.0/maven-build-cache-extension-1.2.0.jar)

This ensures Maven clients can resolve the artifacts properly using the standard package coordinates, which are required by Build Intelligence to enable caching for Maven builds.

2. Update Your `pom.xml`

Point your Maven build to use your private registry:

```xml
<repositories>
  <repository>
    <id>maven-dev</id>
    <url>https://your-private-maven-registry.example.com/repository/maven-releases</url>
    <releases>
      <enabled>true</enabled>
      <updatePolicy>always</updatePolicy>
    </releases>
    <snapshots>
      <enabled>true</enabled>
      <updatePolicy>always</updatePolicy>
    </snapshots>
  </repository>
</repositories>
```
3. (Optional) Add Authentication
If your registry requires authentication, add this to your `settings.xml` file:

```xml
<settings>
  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>maven-dev</id>
      <username>YOUR_USERNAME</username>
      <password>YOUR_PASSWORD</password>
    </server>
  </servers>
</settings>
```

Make sure the `<id>` in settings.xml matches the one in the `<repository>` section of your pom.xml.

### Using '--profile'
Appending `--profile' to your build command, enables publishing Build Intelligence savings to Harness. This will allow you to clearly view the performance and benefits of using Build Intelligence. Note that even when omitted, Build Intelligence will continue to work and optimize your run as expected, but the savings will not be visible in the UI and relevant dashboards.

For example:  `./gradlew build --profile`

This is currently supported with Gradle build tool only .
