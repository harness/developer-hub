With a Kubernetes cluster build infrastructure, all **Build and Push** steps use [kaniko](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko/blob/main/README.md). Other build infrastructures use [drone-docker](https://github.com/drone-plugins/drone-docker/blob/master/README.md). Kaniko requires root access to build the Docker image. It doesn't support non-root users.

## Enable root access for a single step

If your build runs as non-root (`runAsNonRoot: true`), and you want to run the **Build and Push** step as root, you can set **Run as User** to `0` on the **Build and Push** step to use the root user for that individual step only.

If your security policy doesn't allow running as root for any step, you must [use the Buildah plugin](#use-the-buildah-plugin).

## Use the Buildah plugin

If your security policy doesn't allow running as root for any step, you must use the [Buildah plugin](https://plugins.drone.io/plugins/buildah) in a **Plugin** step to build and push your image.

To use the Buildah plugin, you must meet the following requirements:

* You need a [CI pipeline](../prep-ci-pipeline-components.md) with a [Build stage](../set-up-build-infrastructure/ci-stage-settings.md).
* The Build stage must use a [Kubernetes cluster build infrastructure](../set-up-build-infrastructure/k8s-build-infrastructure/set-up-a-kubernetes-cluster-build-infrastructure.md) configured to [run as non-root](../set-up-build-infrastructure/ci-stage-settings.md#run-as-non-root-or-a-specific-user).
* `anyuid` SCC is required. For more information, go to the OpenShift documentation on [Managing Security Context Constraints](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/admin_guide/manage_scc.html).

### Add a Plugin step


<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Visual" label="Visual">


At the point in your pipeline where you want to build and upload an image, add a [Plugin step](../use-drone-plugins/plugin-step-settings-reference.md) that uses the `buildah` plugin.

* **Name:** Enter a name.
* **Container Registry:** Select a connector corresponding to your push destination.
   * Docker Hub: Docker connector
   * ACR: Azure connector
   * ECR: AWS connector
   * GAR/GCR: GCP connector
* **Image:** Specify the plugin image and tag to use, such as  `plugins/buildah-docker:1.1.0-linux-amd64`. If you don't specify a tag, the `latest` tag is used by default. Go to an image's Docker Hub page to browse available tags:
   * ACR: [buildah-acr](https://hub.docker.com/r/plugins/buildah-acr/tags)
   * ECR: [buildah-ecr](https://hub.docker.com/r/plugins/buildah-ecr/tags)
   * GAR/GCR: [buildah-gcr](https://hub.docker.com/r/plugins/buildah-gcr)
   * Docker Hub: [buildah-docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/plugins/buildah-docker)
* **Privileged:** Must be enabled for non-OpenShift clusters.
* **Run as User:** Specify the ID of the non-root user to use for this step, such as `1000`.
* **Settings:** Add the following settings as key-value pairs.
   * `repo`: The name of the repository where you want to store the image, for example, `<hub-user>/<repo-name>`. For private registries, specify a fully qualified repo name.
   * `tags`: Specify tags for your image.
   * `registry`: Specify the registry index, such as `https://index.docker.io/v2/`. The registry format for ECR is `aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com`.
   * `dockerfile`: Specify the Dockerfile to use for the build.
   * `username`: Provide the username to access the push destination, either as plaintext or an [expression](/docs/platform/variables-and-expressions/runtime-inputs/#expressions) referencing a [Harness secret](/docs/category/secrets) or [pipeline variable](/docs/platform/Variables-and-Expressions/add-a-variable), such as `<+pipeline.variables.DOCKER_HUB_USER>`.
   * `password`: An [expression](/docs/platform/variables-and-expressions/runtime-inputs/#expressions) referencing a [Harness secret](/docs/category/secrets) or [pipeline variable](/docs/platform/Variables-and-Expressions/add-a-variable) containing the password to access the push destination, such as `<+pipeline.variables.DOCKER_HUB_SECRET>`.
   * For more information and additional settings, including AWS S3 settings, go to [Buildah plugin settings](#buildah-plugin-settings).

At the point in your pipeline where you want to build and upload an image, add a [Plugin step](../use-drone-plugins/plugin-step-settings-reference.md) that uses the `buildah` plugin, for example:

```yaml
                - step:
                    type: Plugin
                    name: buildah-docker
                    identifier: buildahdocker
                    spec:
                      connectorRef: account.harnessImage
                      image: plugins/buildah-docker:1.1.0-linux-amd64
                      privileged: false
                      settings:
                        repo: myDockerHub1234/test
                        tags: buildahtest
                        registry: https://index.docker.io/v2/
                        dockerfile: Dockerfile
                        username: <+secrets.getValue("DOCKER_HUB_USER")>
                        password: <+secrets.getValue("DOCKER_HUB_SECRET")>
                      runAsUser: "1000"
```

This step requires the following specifications:

* `connectorRef`: Provide the ID of a connector corresponding to your push destination.
   * Docker Hub: Docker connector
   * ACR: Azure connector
   * ECR: AWS connector
   * GAR/GCR: GCP connector
* `image`: Specify the plugin image and tag to use, such as  `plugins/buildah-docker:1.1.0-linux-amd64`. If you don't specify a tag, the `latest` tag is used by default. Go to an image's Docker Hub page to browse available tags:
   * ACR: [buildah-acr](https://hub.docker.com/r/plugins/buildah-acr/tags)
   * ECR: [buildah-ecr](https://hub.docker.com/r/plugins/buildah-ecr/tags)
   * GAR/GCR: [buildah-gcr](https://hub.docker.com/r/plugins/buildah-gcr)
   * Docker Hub: [buildah-docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/plugins/buildah-docker)
* `privileged`: Set to `false` for OpenShift clusters. Set to `true` for non-OpenShift clusters.
* `runAsUser`: Specify the ID of the non-root user to use for this step, such as `1000`.
* `settings`: Add the following settings as key-value pairs.
   * `repo`: The name of the repository where you want to store the image, for example, `<hub-user>/<repo-name>`. For private registries, specify a fully qualified repo name.
   * `tags`: Specify tags for your image.
   * `registry`: Specify the registry index, such as `https://index.docker.io/v2/`. The registry format for ECR is `aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com`.
   * `dockerfile`: Specify the Dockerfile to use for the build.
   * `username`: Provide the username to access the push destination, either as plaintext or an [expression](/docs/platform/variables-and-expressions/runtime-inputs/#expressions) referencing a [Harness secret](/docs/category/secrets) or [pipeline variable](/docs/platform/Variables-and-Expressions/add-a-variable), such as `<+pipeline.variables.DOCKER_HUB_USER>`.
   * `password`: An [expression](/docs/platform/variables-and-expressions/runtime-inputs/#expressions) referencing a [Harness secret](/docs/category/secrets) or [pipeline variable](/docs/platform/Variables-and-Expressions/add-a-variable) containing the password to access the push destination, such as `<+pipeline.variables.DOCKER_HUB_SECRET>`.

#### Buildah plugin settings

For information about Buildah plugin settings, go to the [Buildah README](https://github.com/drone-plugins/drone-buildah/blob/master/README.md), the [Buildah Drone Plugins Marketplace page](https://plugins.drone.io/plugins/buildah), and the the `main.go` file for each destination:

* [Docker main.go](https://github.com/drone-plugins/drone-buildah/blob/master/cmd/drone-docker/main.go)
* [ACR main.go](https://github.com/drone-plugins/drone-buildah/blob/master/cmd/drone-acr/main.go)
* [ECR main.go](https://github.com/drone-plugins/drone-buildah/blob/master/cmd/drone-ecr/main.go)
* [GAR/GCR main.go](https://github.com/drone-plugins/drone-buildah/blob/master/cmd/drone-gcr/main.go)

Many Buildah plugin settings correspond with settings for the built-in **Build and Push** steps. If you're encountering an error with the `buildah` plugin configuration, you can reference the settings definitions for the built-in steps for guidance on the expected value for the equivalent Buildah settings. However, keep in mind that the configuration for **Build and Push** steps (such as field names and location in the YAML) is not an exact match to the **Plugin** step configuration.

| Destination | Buildah image | Buildah main.go | Equivalent Build and Push step |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Docker Hub | `buildah-docker` | [Docker main.go](https://github.com/drone-plugins/drone-buildah/blob/master/cmd/drone-docker/main.go) | [Build and Push to Docker Hub](./build-and-push-to-docker-hub-step-settings.md) |
| ACR | `buildah-acr` | [ACR main.go](https://github.com/drone-plugins/drone-buildah/blob/master/cmd/drone-acr/main.go) | [Build and Push to ACR](./build-and-push-to-acr.md) |
| ECR | `buildah-ecr` | [ECR main.go](https://github.com/drone-plugins/drone-buildah/blob/master/cmd/drone-ecr/main.go) | [Build and Push to ECR](./build-and-push-to-ecr-step-settings.md) |
| GAR/GCR | `buildah-grc` | [GCR main.go](https://github.com/drone-plugins/drone-buildah/blob/master/cmd/drone-gcr/main.go) | [Build and Push to GAR](./build-and-push-to-gar.md)/[Build and Push to GCR](./build-and-push-to-gcr.md) |

## Stage YAML example

This YAML example shows a Build (`CI`) stage with a Kubernetes cluster build infrastructure running as non-root (`runAsNonRoot: true` and `runAsUser: "1000"`) and a `Plugin` step running the Buildah plugin.

```yaml
    - stage:
        identifier: stage1
        type: CI
        name: stage1
        spec:
          cloneCodebase: true
          infrastructure:
            type: KubernetesDirect
            spec:
              connectorRef: YOUR_KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_CONNECTOR
              namespace: YOUR_NAMESPACE
              automountServiceAccountToken: true
              nodeSelector: {}
              containerSecurityContext:
                runAsNonRoot: true
                runAsUser: "1000"
              os: Linux
          execution:
            steps:
              - step:
                  identifier: buildah plugin
                  type: Plugin
                  name: buildah_plugin
                  spec:
                    connectorRef: YOUR_DOCKER_CONNECTOR
                    image: plugins/buildah-docker:1.1.0-linux-amd64
                    privileged: true
                    settings:
                      repo: myhub/test-repo
                      tags: builadhrootless
                      registry: https://index.docker.io/v2/
                      dockerfile: Dockerfile2
                      username: <+pipeline.variables.DOCKER_HUB_USER>
                      password: <+secrets.getValue("MyDockerPAT")>
                    runAsUser: "1000"
```

## Build an image without pushing

You can use your CI pipeline to test a Dockerfile used in your codebase and verify that the resulting image is correct before you push it to your Docker repository.

The following configuration is valid with the Docker Buildah plugin (`plugins/buildah-docker`) only.

1. In your CI pipeline, go to the **Build** stage that includes the **Plugin** step with the Docker Buildah plugin.
2. In the **Build** stage's **Overview** tab, expand the **Advanced** section.
3. Select **Add Variable** and enter the following:
   * **Name:** `PLUGIN_DRY_RUN`
   * **Type:** **String**
   * **Value:** `true`
4. Save and run the pipeline.
