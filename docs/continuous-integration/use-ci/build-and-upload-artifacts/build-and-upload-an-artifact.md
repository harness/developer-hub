Once you've defined a build farm in the CI stage's Infrastructure, you can add a Build and Push step to build your codebase and push the artifact to a repo. The following repos are supported:


* Docker
* Azure Container Registry (ACR)
* Google Container Registry (GCR)
* Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)


For setting up a build farm, see: [Set Up Build Infrastructure](/docs/category/set-up-build-infrastructure).


This topic describes a simple one-step build workflow, minus testing: build the code in a build farm and then push it to a repo. For a quick summary of a build, push, and test Pipeline, see [CI Pipeline Quickstart](../../ci-quickstarts/ci-pipeline-quickstart.md).


For details about each build and push step, see [CI Technical Reference](/docs/category/ci-technical-reference).


### Before You Begin


You should be familiar with the following:


* [CI Pipeline Quickstart](../../ci-quickstarts/ci-pipeline-quickstart.md)
* [CI Stage Settings](../../ci-technical-reference/ci-stage-settings.md)
* [Set Up Build Infrastructure](/docs/category/set-up-build-infrastructure)
* [Learn Harness' Key Concepts](../../../getting-started/learn-harness-key-concepts.md)


### Visual Summary


Here's a short video showing how to set up a Build and Push step.

### Step 1: Create the CI Stage


In your Harness Pipeline, click **Add Stage**, and then click **CI**.


### Step 2: Add the Codebase


Do one of the following:


* If this is the first CI stage in the Pipeline, in the CI stage settings, enable **Clone Codebase**.
* If you have an existing Pipeline with a CI stage, click **Codebase** on the right.


In **Connector**, select an existing Connector to your codebase repo, or create a new one. See [Code Repo Connectors](/docs/category/code-repo-connectors).


You can see the URL for the repo account below **Repository Name**. Don't add the URL into **Repository Name**.


In **Repository Name**, enter the name of the repo containing the codebase.


For example, if the account URL is `https://github.com/mycompany` and the repo in that account is `myapp`, you can simply enter `myapp` in **Repository Name**.


You specify the codebase repo here, but you enter the Git branch or tag when you deploy the Pipeline.


### Step 3: Define the Build Farm Infrastructure


In the CI stage **Infrastructure**, define the build farm for the codebase.


The following example uses a Kubernetes cluster build farm.


In **Select a Kubernetes Cluster**, select or create a Kubernetes Connector. This Connector connects Harness to the cluster to use as the build farm. See [Kubernetes Cluster Connector Settings Reference](../../../platform/7_Connectors/ref-cloud-providers/kubernetes-cluster-connector-settings-reference.md).


In **Namespace**, enter the Kubernetes namespace to use. You can use a text string, a Runtime Input (`<+input>`), or an expression. See [Runtime Inputs](../../../platform/20_References/runtime-inputs.md).


See [Define Kubernetes Cluster Build Infrastructure](../set-up-build-infrastructure/set-up-a-kubernetes-cluster-build-infrastructure.md).


### Step 4: Add the Build and Push Step


In the stage's **Execution**, add a Build and Push step. See the following topics, based on the registry provider:


* Docker: [Build and Push to Docker Registry Step](../../ci-technical-reference/build-and-push-to-docker-hub-step-settings.md)
* Azure Container Registry (ACR): Use [Build and Push to Docker Registry Step](../../ci-technical-reference/build-and-push-to-docker-hub-step-settings.md)
* Google Container Registry (GCR): [Build and Push to GCR Step](../../ci-technical-reference/build-and-push-to-gcr-step-settings.md)
* Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR): [Build and Push to ECR Step Settings](../../ci-technical-reference/build-and-push-to-ecr-step-settings.md)


For all Build and Push steps, you select or create a Connector for the target repo, add repo-specific information, and specify Dockerfile information.


#### Option: Add a Tag using Harness Expression


When you push the image to a repo, you tag the image so you can identify it later.


For example, in one stage you push the image, and in a future stage you pull it using its name and tag so you can run integration tests on it.


You can tag the image in any way, but a Harness expression can be very useful.


Let's look at an example:


![](./static/build-and-upload-an-artifact-10.png)

The `<+pipeline.sequenceId>` tags this image in future stages. For example, `harnessdev/ciquickstart:<+pipeline.sequenceId>`.


In the [Configure Service Dependency](../../ci-technical-reference/configure-service-dependency-step-settings.md) Step in a later Stage in the Pipeline, you identify the image location using `<+pipeline.sequenceId>`.



![](./static/build-and-upload-an-artifact-11.png)

The `<+pipeline.sequenceId>` is a built-in Harness variable that represents the **Build ID** number, for example `Build ID: 9`.


After the Pipeline runs you'll see a Build ID:


![](./static/build-and-upload-an-artifact-15.png)

And this Build ID tags the image you push in one stage of your Pipeline, and pull in the image in future stages of your Pipeline.


You'll also see the ID as the tag on the image in your repo:



![](./static/build-and-upload-an-artifact-12.png)

#### Option: Build a Docker Image without Pushing


Suppose you want to test the Dockerfile used in your Codebase and verify that the resulting image is correct, before you push it to your Docker repository. To enable this in your Pipeline, do the following.


1. In your CI Pipeline, go to the Build Stage that includes the Build and Push an Image to Docker Repository step that you want to customize.
2. In the Build Stage Overview, expand the Advanced pane.
3. Click Add Variable and enter the following:
	1. NAME = **PLUGIN\_NO\_PUSH**
	2. TYPE = **String**
	3. VALUE = **true**
4. Save and run the Pipeline.


### Step 5: Specify Codebase Branch or Tag at Pipeline Execution


Once you click **Run Pipeline**, provide the Git branch or tag to use for the execution.


![](./static/build-and-upload-an-artifact-13.png)

Enter the branch or tag and click **Run Pipeline**.


### Step 6: View the Results


You can see the logs for the Build and Push Step in the Pipeline as it runs.


Here's an example that pushes to a Docker repository:


```
/kaniko/executor --dockerfile=Dockerfile --context=dir://. --destination=cretzman/ciquickstart:13

Taking snapshot of files...                    
ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/go-sample-app"]
```


On Docker Hub, you can see the image that you pushed.

In your Harness project's **Builds**, you can see the build listed.


### Configure As Code
