You can use Harness CI to upload artifacts, such as Docker images or test results. [Build and Push steps](#build-and-push) build your codebase and then push the resulting artifact to a container registry or cloud storage repo. [Upload Artifact steps](#upload-artifacts) upload any artifact.

## Build and Push

**Build and Push** steps build your codebase and then push the artifact to a repo. You can:

- [Build and push to Docker Hub or a Docker registry](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/build-and-upload-artifacts/build-and-push-to-docker-hub-step-settings.md)
- [Build and push to Azure Container Registry (ACR)](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/build-and-upload-artifacts/build-and-push-to-acr.md)
- [Build and push to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/build-and-upload-artifacts/build-and-push-to-ecr-step-settings.md)
- [Build and push to Google Artifact Registry (GAR)](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/build-and-upload-artifacts/build-and-push-to-gar.md)
- [Build and push to Google Container Registry (GCR)](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/build-and-upload-artifacts/build-and-push-to-gcr.md)
- [Build and push to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/build-and-upload-artifacts/build-and-push-to-ghcr.md)
- [Build and push to a JFrog Artifactory Docker registry](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/build-and-upload-artifacts/build-and-push-to-docker-jfrog.md)

For other non-Docker upload locations, you can use a script in a [Run step](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/run-ci-scripts/run-step-settings.md) to build and upload the artifact.

### Kubernetes cluster build infrastructures require root access

With Kubernetes cluster build infrastructures, **Build and Push** steps use [kaniko](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko/blob/main/README.md). Other build infrastructures use [drone-docker](https://github.com/drone-plugins/drone-docker/blob/master/README.md). Kaniko requires root access to build the Docker image. It doesn't support non-root users.

If your build runs as non-root (`runAsNonRoot: true`), and you want to run the **Build and Push** step as root, you can set **Run as User** to `0` on the **Build and Push** step to use the root user for that individual step only.

If your security policy doesn't allow running as root, go to [Build and push with non-root users](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/build-and-upload-artifacts/build-and-push-nonroot.md).

## Upload Artifacts

**Upload Artifact** steps upload artifacts. These steps _don't_ include build commands. You can:

- [Upload artifacts to JFrog Artifactory non-Docker registries](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/build-and-upload-artifacts/upload-artifacts-to-jfrog.md)
- [Upload artifacts to GCS](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/build-and-upload-artifacts/upload-artifacts-to-gcs-step-settings.md)
- [Upload artifacts to S3](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/build-and-upload-artifacts/upload-artifacts-to-s-3-step-settings.md)
- [Upload artifacts to Sonatype Nexus](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/build-and-upload-artifacts/upload-artifacts-to-sonatype-nexus.md)
- [Upload Helm charts to Docker registries](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/build-and-upload-artifacts/upload-helm-chart-to-docker.md)

For other upload locations, you can use a script in a [Run step](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/run-ci-scripts/run-step-settings.md) to upload the artifact.
