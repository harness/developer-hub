CI build Infrastructure Pods can interact with servers using self-signed certificates. This option is useful for organizations that prefer to use internal certificates instead of certificates generated by a public Certificate Authority (CA). 

### Important Notes

* This topic assumes that you are familiar with how to implement SSL in Kubernetes. General information about implementing SSL is outside the scope of this topic.
* Harness CI Build and Push steps use the [kaniko](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko) plugin by default. Kaniko uses the path `/kaniko/ssl/certs/additional-ca-cert-bundle.crt` to read certificates.
* Harness uses a UBI image for the Git Clone step. UBI reads certificates from `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt`.
* Different base images use different paths as their default certificate location. For example, Alpine images use this path to recognize certificates: `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt` For any other image, make sure you verify the default certificate path.

### Workflow Description

To implement this functionality, do the following:

1. Create a Kubernetes secret or config map with the required certificates in the same namespace used by the Harness Delegate.  
Here's an example YAML snippet:
```
apiVersion: v1  
kind: Secret  
metadata:  
  name: addcerts  
  namespace: harness-delegate-ng  
type: Opaque  
stringData:                             
  ca.bundle: |  
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----  
    XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX  
    -----END CERTIFICATE-------  
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----  
    XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX  
    -----END CERTIFICATE-------
```
2. Mount the secret as a volume on the Delegate pod. For details, see [Configure a Pod to Use a Volume for Storage](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-volume-storage/) in the Kubernetes documentation.  
You need to specify the following environment variables in the Delegate pod:  
`ADDITIONAL_CERTS_PATH`: the path to the certificates in the Delegate. For example: `/tmp/ca.bundle`.  
`CI_MOUNT_VOLUMES`: a comma-separated list of `source:destination` mappings. The `source` is the certificate path on the delegate and the `destination` is the path where you want to expose the certificates on the build containers. For example:  
`/tmp/ca.bundle:/etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt,/tmp/ca.bundle:/kaniko/ssl/certs/additional-ca-cert-bundle.crt`This list must include *all* certificates that your build containers need to interact with external services.Here's an example YAML snippet:
```
apiVersion: apps/v1  
kind: StatefulSet  
spec:  
  template:  
    spec:  
        env:  
        - name: ADDITIONAL_CERTS_PATH  
          value: /tmp/ca.bundle  
        - name: CI_MOUNT_VOLUMES  
          value: /tmp/ca.bundle:/etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt,/tmp/ca.bundle:/kaniko/ssl/certs/additional-ca-cert-bundle.crt  
        volumeMounts:  
        - name: certvol  
          mountPath: /tmp/ca.bundle  
          subPath:  ca.bundle 
       volumes:  
        - name: certvol  
          secret:  
            secretName: addcerts  
            items:  
            - key: ca.bundle  
              path: ca.bundle
```
3. Restart the Delegate. Once it is up and running, `exec` into the container and ensure that the volume exists at the mounted path and contains your certificates.

### Troubleshooting

If the volumes are not getting mounted to the build containers, or you continue to see certificate errors in your pipeline, try the following:

1. Add a [Run step](../run-ci-scripts/run-a-script-in-a-ci-stage.md) that prints the contents of the destination path. For example, you can include a command such as :  
`cat /kaniko/ssl/certs/additional-ca-cert-bundle.crt`
2. Double-check that the base image used in the step reads certificates from the same path given in the destination path on the Delegate.
