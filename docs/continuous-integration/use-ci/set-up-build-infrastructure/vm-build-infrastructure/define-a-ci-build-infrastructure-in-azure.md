This topic describes how to set up a CI build infrastructure in Microsoft Azure. To do this, you will create a VM and install a Harness Delegate and Drone VM Runner on it. The runner creates VMs dynamically in response to CI build requests. The delegate and runner VM can be inside or outside Azure; however, the instructions on this page assume you will create the VM in Azure.

This is one of several CI build infrastructure options. For example, you can also [set up a Kubernetes cluster build infrastructure](../k8s-build-infrastructure/set-up-a-kubernetes-cluster-build-infrastructure.md).

The following diagram illustrates a CI build farm. The [Harness Delegate](/docs/platform/delegates/delegate-concepts/delegate-overview) communicates directly with your Harness instance. The [VM Runner](https://docs.drone.io/runner/vm/overview/) maintains a pool of VMs for running builds. When the delegate receives a build request, it forwards the request to the runner, which runs the build on an available VM.

## Prepare the Azure VM

These are the requirements to configure an Azure VM application, Entra ID app registration, and Azure VM. This VM is the primary VM where you will host your Harness Delegate and runner. You must have access to Azure and permission to create Azure applications, register applications in Entra ID, and create Azure VMs.

1. In Azure, go to [Virtual Machines](https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.Compute%2FVirtualMachines), and create a VM to host your Harness Delegate and runner. Select a machine type with 4 vCPU and 16 GiB memory or more. Harness recommends the following machine images:

   * [Ubuntu 18.04 LTS](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/canonical.0001-com-ubuntu-pro-bionic?tab=overview)
   * [Microsoft Windows Server 2019 with Containers](https://az-vm-image.info/?cmd=--all+--publisher+microsoftwindowsserver+--sku+containers+--query+%22%5B%3Fcontains%28version%2C+%272019%27%29%5D%22)

2. Create a resource group for your VM.
3. Configure the VM to allow ingress on the following:

   * Port 22 for Linux for SSH login.
   * Port 3389 if you want to run Windows builds and be able to RDP into your build VMs.
   <!-- Port 9079 not required? -->

4. Install Docker and Docker Compose on the VM.

   1. To install Docker on Windows, you must enable [Hyper-V](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/enable-hyper-v) or [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) on your Azure VM.
   2. Follow the Microsoft documentation to [prep Windows for containers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick-start/set-up-environment?tabs=dockerce).
   3. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/vm-vdi/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) on the VM.

5. [Create a VM application](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/vm-applications-how-to?tabs=portal#create-the-vm-application), and assign your VM app to the **Contributor** role for your Azure subscription.

   For information about role assignment, go to the Microsoft documentation on [Assigning Azure roles](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal?tabs=delegate-condition).

6. Go to [Microsoft Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/) and [register your VM application](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app).
7. Assign your Azure VM to the **Owner** role for your VM application.

   1. Go to [Virtual Machines](https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.Compute%2FVirtualMachines), and select your Azure VM.
   2. Select **Access control (IAM)**, and select **Add role assignment**.
   3. On the **Role** tab, select the **Owner** role, and then select **Next**.
   4. On the **Members** tab, select **User, group, or service principal**, select **Select members**, and then select the VM app that you registered in Entra ID.
   5. Select **Next**, and then select **Review + assign**.

   For more information, go to the Microsoft documentation on [Assigning Azure roles](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal?tabs=delegate-condition).

## Configure the Drone pool on the Azure VM

The `pool.yml` file defines the VM spec and pool size for the VM instances used to run a pipeline. A pool is a group of instantiated VM that are immediately available to run CI pipelines. You can configure multiple pools in `pool.yml`, such as a Windows VM pool and a Linux VM pool.

1. Create a `/runner` folder on your delegate VM and `cd` into it:

   ```
   mkdir /runner
   cd /runner
   ```

2. In the `/runner` folder, create a `pool.yml` file.
3. Modify `pool.yml` as described in the [pool.yml examples](#poolyml-examples) and the [Pool settings reference](#pool-settings-reference).

### Pool settings reference

You can configure the following settings in your `pool.yml` file. You can also learn more in the Drone documentation for the [Pool File](https://docs.drone.io/runner/vm/configuration/pool/) and [Azure drivers](https://docs.drone.io/runner/vm/drivers/azure/).

:::info

The `account` settings (`client_id`, `client_secret`, `subscription_id`, and `tenant_id`) are required to allow the runner to create new VMs.

:::

| Setting | Type | Example | Description |
| ------- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `name` | String | `name: windows_pool` | Unique identifier of the pool. You will need to specify this pool name in Harness when you [set up the CI stage build infrastructure](#specify-build-infrastructure). |
| `pool` | Integer | `pool: 1` | Warm pool size number. Denotes the number of VMs in ready state to be used by the runner. |
| `limit` | Integer | `limit: 3` | Maximum number of VMs the runner can create at any time. `pool` indicates the number of warm VMs, and the runner can create more VMs on demand up to the `limit`.<br/>For example, assume `pool: 3` and `limit: 10`. If the runner gets a request for 5 VMs, it immediately provisions the 3 warm VMs (from `pool`) and provisions 2 more, which are not warm and take time to initialize. |
| `platform` | Key-value pairs, strings | `platform: os: linux arch: amd64 variant: VERSION` | Specify VM platform operating system (`os`) and architecture (`arch`). `variant` is optional. |
| `spec` | Key-value pairs, various | Go to [pool.yml examples](#poolyml-examples). | Configure settings for the build VMs.<ul><li>`account`: Provide Azure account settings the runner needs to create new VMs:<ul><li>`client_id`: Your VM application's client ID from the Entra ID app registration. To find the client ID in Entra ID, go to **App Registrations**, select your VM app, and then locate the **Application (client) ID** on the **Overview** page.</li><li>`client_secret`: To create a client secret, go to your app in Entra ID, and then select **Certificates and Secrets**.</li><li>`subscription_id`: The Azure subscription ID where your VM application is a Contributor.</li><li>`tenant_id`: Your Entra directory ID. To find the tenant ID in Entra ID, go to **App Registrations**, select your VM app, and then locate the **Directory (tenant) ID** on the **Overview** page.</li></ul></li><li>`image`: The image type to use for the build VM. You can use your own custom-created image or use one from the [Azure VM image list](https://az-vm-image.info/).</li><li>`location`: The Azure region for the build VMs. To minimize latency, use the same region as the delegate VM.</li><li>`size`: The Azure VM size.</li><li>`tag`: You can add an optional tag to identify build VMs.</li><li>`disk`: You can provide the `size` (as an integer representing GB) and `type` (as a string)</li></ul> |

## Start the runner

[SSH into your Azure VM](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/connect-ssh?tabs=azurecli) and run the following command to start the runner:

```
docker run -v /runner:/runner -p 3000:3000 drone/drone-runner-aws:latest  delegate --pool /runner/pool.yml
```

This command mounts the volume to the Docker container providing access to `pool.yml` to authenticate with Azure. It also exposes port 3000 and passes arguments to the container.

If using an Ubuntu machine image, you might need to modify the command to use sudo and specify the runner directory path, for example:

```
sudo docker run -v ./runner:/runner -p 3000:3000 drone/drone-runner-aws:latest  delegate --pool /runner/pool.yml
```

:::info What does the runner do?

When a build starts, the delegate receives a request for VMs on which to run the build. The delegate forwards the request to the runner, which then allocates VMs from the warm pool (specified by `pool` in `pool.yml`) and, if necessary, spins up additional VMs (up to the `limit` specified in `pool.yml`).

The runner includes lite engine, and the lite engine process triggers VM startup through a cloud init script. This script downloads and installs Scoop package manager, Git, the Drone plugin, and lite engine on the build VMs. The plugin and lite engine are downloaded from GitHub releases. Scoop is downloaded from `get.scoop.sh`.

Firewall restrictions can prevent the script from downloading these dependencies. Make sure your images don't have firewall or anti-malware restrictions that are interfering with downloading the dependencies.

:::


## Install the delegate

Install a Harness Docker Delegate on your Azure VM.

1. In Harness, go to **Account Settings**, select **Account Resources**, and then select **Delegates**.

   You can also create delegates at the project scope. To do this, go to your Harness CI project, select **Project Setup**, and then select **Delegates**.

2. Select **New Delegate** or **Install Delegate**.
3. Select **Docker**.
4. Enter a **Delegate Name**.
5. Copy the delegate install command and paste it in a text editor.
6. To the first line, add `--network host`, and, if required, `sudo`. For example:

   ```
   sudo docker run --cpus=1 --memory=2g --network host
   ```

7. [SSH into your Azure VM](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/connect-ssh?tabs=azurecli) and run the delegate install command.

:::tip

The delegate install command uses the default authentication token for your Harness account. If you want to use a different token, you can create a token and then specify it in the delegate install command:

1. In Harness, go to **Account Settings**, then **Account Resources**, and then select **Delegates**.
2. Select **Tokens** in the header, and then select **New Token**.
3. Enter a token name and select **Apply** to generate a token.
4. Copy the token and paste it in the value for `DELEGATE_TOKEN`.

:::

For more information about delegates and delegate installation, go to [Delegate installation overview](/docs/platform/delegates/install-delegates/overview).

## Verify connectivity

1. Verify that the delegate and runner containers are running correctly. You might need to wait a few minutes for both processes to start. You can run the following commands to check the process status:

	 ```
	 $ docker ps
	 $ docker logs DELEGATE_CONTAINER_ID
	 $ docker logs RUNNER_CONTAINER_ID
	 ```

2. In the Harness UI, verify that the delegate appears in the delegates list. It might take two or three minutes for the Delegates list to update. Make sure the **Connectivity Status** is **Connected**. If the **Connectivity Status** is **Not Connected**, make sure the Docker host can connect to `https://app.harness.io`.

   ![](../static/define-a-ci-build-infrastructure-in-azure-17.png)

The delegate and runner are now installed, registered, and connected.
