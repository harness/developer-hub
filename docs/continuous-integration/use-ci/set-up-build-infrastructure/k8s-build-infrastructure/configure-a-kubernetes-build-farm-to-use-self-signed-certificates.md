CI build infrastructure pods can interact with servers using self-signed certificates. This option is useful for organizations that prefer to use internal certificates instead of certificates generated by a public Certificate Authority (CA).

:::info

* This topic assumes that you are familiar with how to implement SSL in Kubernetes. General information about implementing SSL is outside the scope of this topic.
* With a Kubernetes cluster build infrastructure, all **Build and Push** steps use [kaniko](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko/blob/main/README.md). Kaniko reads certificates from `/kaniko/ssl/certs/additional-ca-cert-bundle.crt`.
* Harness uses a UBI image for the Git Clone step. UBI reads certificates from `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt`.
* Different base images use different paths as their default certificate location. For example, Alpine images use the path `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`. For other images, make sure you verify the default certificate path.

:::

## Enable self-signed certificates

1. Create a Kubernetes secret or config map with the required certificates in the same namespace used by the Harness Delegate. For example:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Secret
   metadata:
     name: addcerts
     namespace: harness-delegate-ng
   type: Opaque
   stringData:
     ca.bundle: |
       -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
       XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
       -----END CERTIFICATE-------
       -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
       XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
       -----END CERTIFICATE-------
   ```

2. Mount the secret as a [volume on the delegate pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-volume-storage/) and add a `volumeMount` to your certificate files at `/opt/harness-delegate/ca-bundle`.

   In the delegate pod, do the following:

     1. Provide a comma-separated list of paths in the build pod where you want the certs to be mounted.
     2. Mount your certificate files to `/opt/harness-delegate/ca-bundle`.

   To mount the secret, go to the delegate `Deployment` YAML and update `volumeMounts` and `volumes`. For an example, expand the section below.

   :::info
   Secrets are retrieved by the delegate. For Kubernetes build infrastructure, secrets are set as Kubernetes secrets and passed to the pod.

   Both CI build pods and the SCM client on the delegate support this method.

   * Make sure the destination path is not same as the default CA certificate path of the corresponding container image.

   * If you override the default certificate file, make sure the Kubernetes secret or config map (from step one) includes *all* certificates required by the pipelines that will use this build infrastructure.

   <!-- * To save time and minimize the number of default certificates you need to declare, you can enable the auto-mount default certificates beta feature. This feature automatically mounts certificates for certain step containers, and you no longer need to declare the certs path for the built-in steps in addition to your own self-signed certificates. Currently, auto-mounting default certificates is behind the feature flag `CI_DEFAULT_CERTS`. Contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io) to enable the feature.-->

3. Restart the delegate. Once it is up and running, `exec` into the container and ensure that the volume exists at the mounted path and contains your certificates.

## Enable self-signed certificates with a self-hosted image registry (advanced)

:::important

This workflow is applicable only if you're using a self-hosted registry to store your container images. For all other workflows, go to [Enable self-signed certificates](#enable-self-signed-certificates). 

:::

1. Create a Kubernetes secret or config map with the required certificates in the same namespace used by the Harness delegate. For example:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Secret
   metadata:
     name: addcerts
     namespace: harness-delegate-ng
   type: Opaque
   stringData:
     ca.bundle: |
       -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
       XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
       -----END CERTIFICATE-------
       -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
       XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
       -----END CERTIFICATE-------
   ```

2. Mount the secret as a [volume on the delegate pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-volume-storage/).

   In the delegate pod, do the following:

      1. Add `DESTINATION_CA_PATH` to the environment.
      2. Provide a comma-separated list of paths in the build pod where you want the certs to be mounted.
      3. Mount your certificate files to `/opt/harness-delegate/ca-bundle`.

   To add `DESTINATION_CA_PATH` and mount the secret, go to the delegate `Deployment` YAML and update `env`, `volumeMounts`, and `volumes`. For an example, expand the section below.

   <summary>Legacy: CI_MOUNT_VOLUMES</summary>

   Prior to the introduction of `DESTINATION_CA_PATH`, you used `ADDITIONAL_CERTS_PATH` and `CI_MOUNT_VOLUMES` to mount certs.

   The legacy method is still supported, but Harness recommends `DESTINATION_CA_PATH`. If you include both, `DESTINATION_CA_PATH` takes precedence. If Harness can't resolve `DESTINATION_CA_PATH`, it falls back to `CI_MOUNT_VOLUMES` and `ADDITIONAL_CERTS_PATH`.

   You must specify both `ADDITIONAL_CERTS_PATH` and `CI_MOUNT_VOLUMES`.

   For `ADDITIONAL_CERTS_PATH`, provide the path to the certificates in the delegate, such as `/tmp/ca.bundle`.

   For `CI_MOUNT_VOLUMES`, provide a comma-separated list of `source:destination` mappings where `source` is the certificate path on the delegate, and `destination` is the path where you want to expose the certificates on the build containers. For example:

   ```
   /tmp/ca.bundle:/etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt,/tmp/ca.bundle:/kaniko/ssl/certs/additional-ca-cert-bundle.crt
   ```

   The `CI_MOUNT_VOLUMES` list must include *all* certificates that your build containers need to interact with external services.

   ```yaml
         spec:
           containers:
             - image: harness/delegate:yy.mm.verno
               # ...
               env:
               # ADD ADDITIONAL_CERTS_PATH AND CI_MOUNT_VOLUMES HERE
                 - name: ADDITIONAL_CERTS_PATH
                   value: /tmp/ca.bundle
                 - name: CI_MOUNT_VOLUMES
                   value: "/tmp/ca.bundle:/etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt,/tmp/ca.bundle:/kaniko/ssl/certs/additional-ca-cert-bundle.crt"
               volumeMounts:
               # ADD VOLUME MOUNT HERE
                 - name: certvol
                   mountPath: /tmp/ca.bundle
                   subPath:  ca.bundle
           volumes:
             # ADD VOLUME HERE
             - name: certvol
               secret:
                 secretName: addcerts
                 items:
                 - key: ca.bundle
                   path: ca.bundle
   ```

   </details>

3. If you're storing your certificates in a local registry and [need to run Docker-in-Docker](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/sto-techref-category/security-step-settings-reference#configuring-docker-in-docker-dind-for-your-pipeline), specify the local certificate path on the delegate.

   For example, if your self-signed certs are stored at `https://my-registry.local.org:799` and you log in with `docker login my-registry.local.org:799`, then you add the path to your `DESTINATION_CA_PATH` environment like this:

   ```yaml
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: harness/delegate:yy.mm.verno
        env:
        - name: DESTINATION_CA_PATH
          value: "/etc/docker/certs.d/my-registry.local.org:799/ca.crt,/etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt,/kaniko/ssl/certs/additional-ca-cert-bundle.crt"
        volumeMounts:
          - name: certvol
            mountPath: /opt/harness-delegate/ca-bundle/ca.bundle
            subPath:  ca.bundle
      volumes:
      - name: certvol
        secret:
            secretName: addcerts
             items:
             - key: ca.bundle
               path: ca.bundle
   ```

4. Restart the delegate. Once it's up and running, `exec` into the container and ensure that the volume exists at the mounted path and contains your certificates.

## Secret Name Creation for Certificate Bundles in Build Pods

When a customer mounts a certificate bundle in their build pods, the bundle is created as a secret and mounted in the pod.

The secret names follow a specific format: `Podname-filename-hash`.

For Exampple:-
**Pod Name**: `harnessci-buildpod-9rwcbkl6`
**Secret Name**: `harnessci-buildpod-9rwcbkl6-custom-cr-pem-0-pem-1667255857`
Here, `custom-cr-pem` is the pem file name and `1667255857` is the random hash that is generated during secret creation.

The name is sanitized to comply with Kubernetes naming conventions. If the total length exceeds 63 characters, it is trimmed from the end to ensure compliance.

:::info note
1. Previously, if the characters exceeded the limit, users had to manually shorten the file or stage names to avoid errors. Now, this change for automatic trimming of secret names beyond 63 characters is available starting from **delegate release 821xx**.
2. This behavior applies only to **Kubernetes architecture**.
3. To avoid potential failures in Kubernetes environments, ensure that all secret names are lowercase. Starting from **delegate release 825xx**, any uppercase characters in the secret name are automatically converted to lowercase to ensure compatibility with Kubernetes naming conventions.
