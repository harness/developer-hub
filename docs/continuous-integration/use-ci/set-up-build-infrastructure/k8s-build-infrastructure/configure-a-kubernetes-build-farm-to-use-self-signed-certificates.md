CI build infrastructure pods can interact with servers using self-signed certificates. This option is useful for organizations that prefer to use internal certificates instead of certificates generated by a public Certificate Authority (CA).

:::info

* This topic assumes that you are familiar with how to implement SSL in Kubernetes. General information about implementing SSL is outside the scope of this topic.
* With a Kubernetes cluster build infrastructure, all **Build and Push** steps use [kaniko](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko/blob/main/README.md). Kaniko reads certificates from `/kaniko/ssl/certs/additional-ca-cert-bundle.crt`.
* Harness uses a UBI image for the Git Clone step. UBI reads certificates from `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt`.
* Different base images use different paths as their default certificate location. For example, Alpine images use the path `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`. For other images, make sure you verify the default certificate path.

:::

## Enable self-signed certificates

1. Create a Kubernetes secret or config map with the required certificates in the same namespace used by the Harness Delegate. For example:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Secret
   metadata:
     name: addcerts
     namespace: harness-delegate-ng
   type: Opaque
   stringData:
     ca.bundle: |
       -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
       XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
       -----END CERTIFICATE-------
       -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
       XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
       -----END CERTIFICATE-------
   ```

2. Mount the secret as a [volume on the delegate pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-volume-storage/) and add a `volumeMount` to your certificate files at `/opt/harness-delegate/ca-bundle`.

   In the delegate pod, do the following:

     1. Provide a comma-separated list of paths in the build pod where you want the certs to be mounted.
     2. Mount your certificate files to `/opt/harness-delegate/ca-bundle`.

   To mount the secret, go to the delegate `Deployment` YAML and update `volumeMounts` and `volumes`. For an example, expand the section below.

   :::info
   Secrets are retrieved by the delegate. For Kubernetes build infrastructure, secrets are set as Kubernetes secrets and passed to the pod.

                    path: ca.bundle

   ```

   Both CI build pods and the SCM client on the delegate support this method.

   * Make sure the destination path is not same as the default CA certificate path of the corresponding container image.

   * If you override the default certificate file, make sure the Kubernetes secret or config map (from step one) includes *all* certificates required by the pipelines that will use this build infrastructure.

   <!-- * To save time and minimize the number of default certificates you need to declare, you can enable the auto-mount default certificates beta feature. This feature automatically mounts certificates for certain step containers, and you no longer need to declare the certs path for the built-in steps in addition to your own self-signed certificates. Currently, auto-mounting default certificates is behind the feature flag `CI_DEFAULT_CERTS`. Contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io) to enable the feature.-->

3. Restart the delegate. Once it is up and running, `exec` into the container and ensure that the volume exists at the mounted path and contains your certificates.

## Enable self-signed certificates with a self-hosted image registry (advanced)

:::important

This workflow is applicable only if you're using a self-hosted registry to store your container images. For all other workflows, go to [Enable self-signed certificates](#enable-self-signed-certificates). 

:::

1. Create a Kubernetes secret or config map with the required certificates in the same namespace used by the Harness delegate. For example:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Secret
   metadata:
     name: addcerts
     namespace: harness-delegate-ng
   type: Opaque
   stringData:
     ca.bundle: |
       -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
       XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
       -----END CERTIFICATE-------
       -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
       XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
       -----END CERTIFICATE-------
   ```

2. Mount the secret as a [volume on the delegate pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-volume-storage/).

   In the delegate pod, do the following:

      1. Add `DESTINATION_CA_PATH` to the environment.
      2. Provide a comma-separated list of paths in the build pod where you want the certs to be mounted.
      3. Mount your certificate files to `/opt/harness-delegate/ca-bundle`.

   To add `DESTINATION_CA_PATH` and mount the secret, go to the delegate `Deployment` YAML and update `env`, `volumeMounts`, and `volumes`. For an example, expand the section below.

   <summary>Legacy: CI_MOUNT_VOLUMES</summary>

   Prior to the introduction of `DESTINATION_CA_PATH`, you used `ADDITIONAL_CERTS_PATH` and `CI_MOUNT_VOLUMES` to mount certs.

   The legacy method is still supported, but Harness recommends `DESTINATION_CA_PATH`. If you include both, `DESTINATION_CA_PATH` takes precedence. If Harness can't resolve `DESTINATION_CA_PATH`, it falls back to `CI_MOUNT_VOLUMES` and `ADDITIONAL_CERTS_PATH`.

   You must specify both `ADDITIONAL_CERTS_PATH` and `CI_MOUNT_VOLUMES`.

   For `ADDITIONAL_CERTS_PATH`, provide the path to the certificates in the delegate, such as `/tmp/ca.bundle`.

   For `CI_MOUNT_VOLUMES`, provide a comma-separated list of `source:destination` mappings where `source` is the certificate path on the delegate, and `destination` is the path where you want to expose the certificates on the build containers. For example:

   ```
   /tmp/ca.bundle:/etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt,/tmp/ca.bundle:/kaniko/ssl/certs/additional-ca-cert-bundle.crt
   ```

   The `CI_MOUNT_VOLUMES` list must include *all* certificates that your build containers need to interact with external services.

   ```yaml
         spec:
           containers:
             - image: harness/delegate:yy.mm.verno
               # ...
               env:
               # ADD ADDITIONAL_CERTS_PATH AND CI_MOUNT_VOLUMES HERE
                 - name: ADDITIONAL_CERTS_PATH
                   value: /tmp/ca.bundle
                 - name: CI_MOUNT_VOLUMES
                   value: "/tmp/ca.bundle:/etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt,/tmp/ca.bundle:/kaniko/ssl/certs/additional-ca-cert-bundle.crt"
               volumeMounts:
               # ADD VOLUME MOUNT HERE
                 - name: certvol
                   mountPath: /tmp/ca.bundle
                   subPath:  ca.bundle
           volumes:
             # ADD VOLUME HERE
             - name: certvol
               secret:
                 secretName: addcerts
                 items:
                 - key: ca.bundle
                   path: ca.bundle
   ```

   </details>

3. If you're storing your certificates in a local registry and [need to run Docker-in-Docker](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/sto-techref-category/security-step-settings-reference#docker-in-docker-requirements-for-sto), specify the local certificate path on the delegate.

   For example, if your self-signed certs are stored at `https://my-registry.local.org:799` and you log in with `docker login my-registry.local.org:799`, then you add the path to your `DESTINATION_CA_PATH` environment like this:

   ```yaml
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: harness/delegate:yy.mm.verno
        env:
        - name: DESTINATION_CA_PATH
          value: "/etc/docker/certs.d/my-registry.local.org:799/ca.crt,/etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt,/kaniko/ssl/certs/additional-ca-cert-bundle.crt"
        volumeMounts:
          - name: certvol
            mountPath: /opt/harness-delegate/ca-bundle/ca.bundle
            subPath:  ca.bundle
      volumes:
      - name: certvol
        secret:
            secretName: addcerts
             items:
             - key: ca.bundle
               path: ca.bundle
   ```

4. Restart the delegate. Once it's up and running, `exec` into the container and ensure that the volume exists at the mounted path and contains your certificates.
