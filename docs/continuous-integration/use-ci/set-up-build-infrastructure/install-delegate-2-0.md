## Delegate Installation Instructions

### Get Relevant Information

In order to install the delegate, you will need:
- `ACCOUNT_ID`

Navigate to **Project Settings** > **Delegates**. You should see your new delegate in the delegates list.

:::info

If you don't set a name for your delegate, it will default to `harnessRunner`

:::

### Configure Pipeline Delegate

For the CI stages that you want to use the new delegate, you will need to [define the stage variable](/docs/platform/variables-and-expressions/add-a-variable/#define-variables) `HARNESS_CI_INTERNAL_ROUTE_TO_RUNNER` and set it to `true`.

Then, in order to use this delegate, simply [set your pipeline's build infrastructure](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/set-up-build-infrastructure/define-a-docker-build-infrastructure#set-the-pipelines-build-infrastructure) as normal.

Most importantly, ensure that you have set `Local` as the **Infrastructure** and that the **Operating System** and **Architecture** match the delegate you installed in the [download and install delegate step](#download-and-install-the-delegate).

## Delegate Configuration

### Set Max Stage Capacity

With Harness Delegate 2.0, you can configure a limit for the maximum number of stages the delegate will be executing at a given time. When the delegate is handling tasks at full capacity, new tasks will be queued and picked up once the delegate's capacity is freed.  

In order to configure a max limit for number of stages executed by a delegate, you should add a `MAX_STAGES` variable in the delegate's `config.env` file. The value of the `MAX_STAGES` should be a positive integer.

#### Example config.env

If you wanted the runner to only execute up to 5 stages a time, set `MAX_STAGES=5`. For example:

```
ACCOUNT_ID="<ACCOUNT_ID>"
TOKEN="<DELEGATE_TOKEN>"
TAGS="<your delegate tags>"
URL="<MANAGER_HOST_AND_PORT>"
NAME="<your delegate name>"
...
MAX_STAGES=5
```

Here is where the `config.env` file is located for each operating system:
- **MacOS**: The `config.env` file is located in `~/.harness-runner/config.env` (after you run the `./harness-runner` install command).
- **Linux**: The `config.env` file is created by the user during step 3 of linux [runner installation](#download-and-install-the-delegate). The file will be where you created it at that point in time.

## Debugging

### Logs

You can find the delegate logs in the following files:
- **MacOS**: `~/Library/Logs/harness.runner/stderr.log`
- **Linux**: `nohup-runner.out`

## End to End Demo

This video walks through an end to end demo of the delegate installation, including usage and a pipeline execution.
