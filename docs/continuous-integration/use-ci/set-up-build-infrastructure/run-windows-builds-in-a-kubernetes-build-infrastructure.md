You can run Windows builds in your Kubernetes build infrastructure. Windows Server 2019 images are available for running CI Builds and for out-of-the-box Ci Steps such as Run, Run Step, Save, and Restore.

### Important Notes

* You can't run Steps that build and push to Docker registries, because Kaniko is not supported on Windows.
* You canâ€™t run Docker-in-Docker using a Windows image, because privileged mode is not supported on Windows.
* Only Windows Server 2019 images are supported. If you are using Google Kubernetes Engine, make sure you use the recommended image type for Windows Server 2019.

* If you use a custom Windows image in a Run Step, the container must be based on [Windows Server Core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-windows-servercore) version 1809 and must include `netapi32.dll`. To include this in your image, add the following command to the Dockerfile:
```
COPY --from=core /windows/system32/netapi32.dll /windows/system32/netapi32.dll
```

### Run the Windows Build

1. Set up your cluster with both Linux and Windows node pools. Linux is required for running the Delegate.
2. Set up the Build Stage in your Pipeline. Go to the Infrastructure tab and set the following options:
	1. **OS** = **Windows**
	2. Under **Advanced**, set the Node Selector to use the Windows node pool. Enter the following key/value pair:  
	**kubernetes.io/os** = **windows**

3. Run the CI build.

### YAML Example

The following Pipeline definition provides a simple example for setting up a Pipeline to run Windows builds.
