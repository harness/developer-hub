You can run builds on Harness-hosted machines or your own infrastructure. Self-hosted build infrastructure can be local or in a Kubernetes cluster.

# Harness Cloud (Harness-hosted options)

:::info

Harness Cloud is available for all CI plans.

:::

With Harness Cloud you can run builds in isolation on machines hosted and maintained by Harness. You can run builds at scale on Linux, Windows, and macOS machines that are preinstalled with software commonly used in CI pipelines.

Harness maintains and upgrades these machines so that you can focus on building great software instead of maintaining build infrastructure.

To use Harness Cloud, go to [Get started with Harness Cloud](https://developer.harness.io/docs/continuous-integration/ci-quickstarts/hosted-builds-on-virtual-machines-quickstart/).

# Self-hosted options

## Local

:::info

Locally-hosted build infrastructure is available for all CI plans.

:::

With the Local runner (also known as the Docker runner) you can run builds on a local machine. You can execute build steps in Docker containers or directly on the host machine.

To learn more, go to [Define a local build infrastructure](https://developer.harness.io/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/set-up-build-infrastructure/define-a-docker-build-infrastructure).

## Kubernetes cluster

:::info

The self-hosted Kubernetes cluster option is available only for paid CI plans.

:::

Executing builds in a Kubernetes cluster is useful when you want to run ephemeral builds at scale in your own infrastructure.

When running builds in a Kubernetes cluster, each CI stage executes in a pod, and the stage's steps share the pod's resources.

To learn more about using a Kubernetes cluster as build infrastructure, go to [Define a Kubernetes cluster build infrastructure](https://developer.harness.io/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/set-up-build-infrastructure/set-up-a-kubernetes-cluster-build-infrastructure).
