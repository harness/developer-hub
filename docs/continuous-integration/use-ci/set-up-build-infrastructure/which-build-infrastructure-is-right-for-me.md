You can run builds on Harness-hosted machines or your own infrastructure.



<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="hosted" label="Harness Cloud" default>


<DocsTag  text="Free plan" link="/docs/continuous-integration/ci-quickstarts/ci-subscription-mgmt" /> <DocsTag  text="Team plan" link="/docs/continuous-integration/ci-quickstarts/ci-subscription-mgmt" /> <DocsTag  text="Enterprise plan" link="/docs/continuous-integration/ci-quickstarts/ci-subscription-mgmt" />

With Harness Cloud, your builds run in isolation on Harness-hosted machines. You can run builds at scale on Linux, Windows, and macOS machines that are preinstalled with software commonly used in CI pipelines.

Harness hosts, maintains, and upgrades these machines so that you can focus on developing software instead of maintaining build farms.

Harness Cloud is available with all CI plans. For more information, go to [Use Harness Cloud build infrastructure](./use-harness-cloud-build-infrastructure.md).


</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="selfhosted" label="Self-hosted options">


Self-hosted build infrastructure options include local machines, Kubernetes clusters, and VMs from Cloud providers, such as AWS.


<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="local" label="Local" default>

<DocsTag  text="Free plan" link="/docs/continuous-integration/ci-quickstarts/ci-subscription-mgmt" /> <DocsTag  text="Team plan" link="/docs/continuous-integration/ci-quickstarts/ci-subscription-mgmt" /> <DocsTag  text="Enterprise plan" link="/docs/continuous-integration/ci-quickstarts/ci-subscription-mgmt" />

With the local runner, which is also known as the Docker runner, you can run builds on a local machine. You can execute build steps in Docker containers or directly on the host machine.

This option is recommended for small, limited-scale builds, such as one-off builds on your local machine.

Self-hosted local build infrastructure is available with all CI plans. To learn more, go to [Set up a local runner build infrastructure](./define-a-docker-build-infrastructure.md).


</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="k8s" label="Kubernetes cluster">


<DocsTag  text="Team plan" link="/docs/continuous-integration/ci-quickstarts/ci-subscription-mgmt" /> <DocsTag  text="Enterprise plan" link="/docs/continuous-integration/ci-quickstarts/ci-subscription-mgmt" />

Executing builds in a Kubernetes cluster is useful when you want to run ephemeral builds-at-scale in your own infrastructure.

When running builds in a Kubernetes cluster, each CI stage executes in a pod, and the stage's steps share the pod's resources.

To learn more about using a Kubernetes cluster as build infrastructure, go to [Set up a Kubernetes cluster build infrastructure](./k8s-build-infrastructure/set-up-a-kubernetes-cluster-build-infrastructure.md).


</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="vms" label="Virtual machines">


<DocsTag  text="Team plan" link="/docs/continuous-integration/ci-quickstarts/ci-subscription-mgmt" /> <DocsTag  text="Enterprise plan" link="/docs/continuous-integration/ci-quickstarts/ci-subscription-mgmt" />

Your build infrastructure can use VMs from a Cloud provider, including AWS, Microsoft Azure, GCP, and Anka (for macOS build farms).

To learn more about VM build infrastructures, go to [Set up VM build infrastructures](/docs/category/set-up-vm-build-infrastructures).
