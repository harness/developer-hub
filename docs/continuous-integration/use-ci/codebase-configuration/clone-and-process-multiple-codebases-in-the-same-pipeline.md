In addition to the pipeline's default [codebase](./create-and-configure-a-codebase.md), you can use **Git Clone** step to clone additional code repos into the pipeline's workspace.

For example, you can use this to:

* Build multiple artifacts in the same pipeline. Suppose you use Packer and Ansible to build artifacts automatically, and you have separate repositories for Packer, Ansible, and code. You can clone all three repositories into the pipeline's workspace.
* Pull code from separate code and build repositories. For instance, if your code files are in a repository managed by the Engineering team and your Dockerfiles are in a different repository managed by the Security team, you can clone both repositories into the pipeline's workspace.
* Clone codebases without using the built-in clone codebase function.

## Add a Git Clone step

Assume the [default codebase](./create-and-configure-a-codebase#configure-the-default-codebase) is a repo that contains app code files, and the Dockerfile necessary to build the app image is in a different repo. You can use [Git Clone](./git-clone-step) step to clone the second repo into the workspace, or fetch specific files/directories. Then, you can use a [Build and Push](../../../category/build-and-push) step to build and push an image using files from both repos.

Add a **Git Clone** step to clone a second repo into the pipeline's workspace.

```yaml
    - step:
        type: GitClone
        name: clone second repo
        identifier: clone_second_repo
        spec:
          connectorRef: account.git
          repoName: myOrg/mySecondRepo
          build:
            type: branch
            spec:
              branch: main
```

For details, visit the [git clone step](./git-clone-step) page.

## Add a Run step

You can use `git` commands in [Run steps](../run-step-settings.md) to clone multiple repos into a stage. You can also provide arguments to clone subdirectories, clone recursively, and so on.

For example, this step clones a GitHub repository.

```yaml
              - step:
                  type: Run
                  identifier: clone
                  name: clone
                  spec:
                    shell: Sh
                    command: |-
                      git clone https://GH_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN@github.com/ACCOUNT_NAME/REPO_NAME.git
```

To use this command, you would replace:

* `ACCOUNT_NAME` with your GitHub account name.
* `REPO_NAME` with the name of the GitHub repo to clone.
* `PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` with a [GitHub personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) that has pull permissions to the target repository. Additional permissions may be necessary depending on the Action's purpose. Store the token as a [Harness secret](/docs/category/secrets) and use a variable expression, such as `<+secrets.getValue("YOUR_TOKEN_SECRET")>`, to call it.

For details about the **Run** step settings, check out the **Run scripts** tab under the [Run step settings](../run-step-settings.md) page.

When cloning additional codebases that use the same credentials as your default codebase, you can [use your default codebase connector's credentials in your Run step](/kb/continuous-integration/articles/using-git-credentials-from-codebase-connector-in-ci-pipelines-run-step).

## Build an artifact from both code repos

Now that the files from both repos will be cloned into a common workspace, you can add a step to build an image using code from both repos, such as a [Build and Push to Docker step](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/build-and-upload-artifacts/build-and-push/build-and-push-to-docker-registry).

Pay attention to settings like the [Dockerfile setting](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/build-and-upload-artifacts/build-and-push/build-and-push-to-docker-registry/#dockerfile) that assume files are located at the codebase's root directory if not otherwise specified. This is because the pipeline's default codebase files are cloned in the root folder (`/harness`), while other codebase files are cloned into subfolders.

Depending on the default codebase, you might need to specify a non-root path for build files. You can also use commands, such as `cp`, in [Run steps](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/run-step-settings) to move cloned files around the workspace before building the image.

The following YAML example describes a pipeline that clones two code repos, one as the default codebase (`cloneCodebase: true`) and the second in the `GitClone` step.

This example clones app code as the [default codebase](#configure-the-default-codebase) and then uses a **Run** step to clone a separate repo that has the Dockerfile necessary to build the app.

Due to the build infrastructure and the `image` used for the **Run** step, it is necessary to install Git before cloning the additional repo. The **Run** step uses the following commands to install Git, verify that it's working, and then clone the repo that has the Dockerfile needed to build the app.

```
apk add git
git --version
git clone https://github.com/$GITHUB_USERNAME/$DOCKERFILE_REPO_NAME
```

This example also uses [stage variables](../set-up-build-infrastructure/ci-stage-settings.md#advanced-stage-variables), such as `$GITHUB_USERNAME` to reference account and repo names. These variables are accessible across all steps in the stage.

## Use a Plugin step

As an alternative to the **Git Clone** and **Run** steps, you can clone a codebase by running the [Git Drone plugin](https://plugins.drone.io/plugins/git) in a [Plugin step](../use-drone-plugins/run-a-drone-plugin-in-ci.md).
