In addition to the pipeline's default [codebase](./create-and-configure-a-codebase.md), you can use **Git Clone** or **Run** steps to clone additional code repos into the pipeline's workspace. For example, you can use this to:

* Build multiple artifacts in the same pipeline. For example, suppose you use Packer and Ansible to build artifacts automatically, and you have separate repos for Packer, Ansible, and code. You can clone all three repos into the pipeline's workspace.
* Pull code from separate code and build repos. For example, if your code files are in a repo managed by the Engineering team and your Dockerfiles are in a different repo managed by the Security team, you can clone both repos into the pipeline's workspace.

:::info Large file storage

If you need to clone LFS-enabled repositories or run `git lfs` commands (such as `git lfs clone`), go to [Git Large File Storage](./gitlfs.md).

:::

## Configure the default codebase

When you add a **Build** stage to a CI pipeline, you specify the Git account or repository where your code is stored. The codebase declared in a pipeline's first stage becomes the pipeline's default codebase, and this repo is cloned into the workspace automatically when the pipeline runs.

For more information about creating pipelines, configuring the **Build** stage, and specifying the default codebase, go to [CI pipeline creation overview](../prep-ci-pipeline-components.md), [Create and configure a codebase](./create-and-configure-a-codebase.md), and [CI Build stage settings](../set-up-build-infrastructure/ci-stage-settings.md).

## Add a Git Clone or Run step

You can use a **Git Clone** or **Run** step to clone an additional repo into a pipeline's workspace.

For example, assume the [default codebase](#configure-the-default-codebase) is a repo that contains app code files, and the Dockerfile necessary to build the app image is in a different repo. You can use a **Git Clone** or **Run** step to clone the second repo into the workspace. Then, you can use a **Build and Push** step to build and push an image using files from both repos.


<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="gitclone" label="Add a Git Clone step" default>


Add a **Git Clone** step to clone a second repo into the pipeline's workspace.

```yaml
              - step:
                  type: GitClone
                  name: clone second repo
                  identifier: clone_second_repo
                  spec:
                    connectorRef: account.git2
                    build:
                      type: branch
                      spec:
                        branch: main
```

The **Git Clone** step has the following settings. Depending on the stage's build infrastructure, some settings might be unavailable.

### Name, Id, and Description

Enter a **Name** summarizing the step's purpose. Harness automatically assigns an **Id** ([Entity Identifier Reference](../../../platform/references/entity-identifier-reference.md)) based on the **Name**. You can change the **Id**.

The **Description** is an optional text string.

### Connector

Select a connector for the source control provider hosting the code repo that you want the step to clone.

The following topics provide more information about creating code repo connectors:

* Azure Repos: [Connect to Azure Repos](/docs/platform/connectors/code-repositories/connect-to-a-azure-repo)
* Bitbucket: [Bitbucket connector settings reference](/docs/platform/connectors/code-repositories/ref-source-repo-provider/bitbucket-connector-settings-reference)
* GitHub: [GitHub connector settings reference](/docs/platform/connectors/code-repositories/ref-source-repo-provider/git-hub-connector-settings-reference)
* GitLab: [GitLab Connector Settings Reference](/docs/platform/connectors/code-repositories/ref-source-repo-provider/git-lab-connector-settings-reference)
* Other Git providers:
  * [Git connector settings reference](/docs/platform/connectors/code-repositories/ref-source-repo-provider/git-connector-settings-reference)
  * [Connect to an AWS CodeCommit Repo](/docs/platform/connectors/code-repositories/connect-to-code-repo)

### Repository Name

If the connector's [URL Type](/docs/platform/connectors/code-repositories/ref-source-repo-provider/git-connector-settings-reference#url-type) is **Repository**, then **Repository Name** is automatically populated based on the repository defined in the connector's configuration.

If the connector's URL Type is **Account**, then you must specify the name of the code repo that you want to clone into the pipeline workspace.

### Build Type, Branch Name, and Tag Name

For **Build Type**, select **Git Branch** if you want the step to clone code from a specific branch within the repo, or select **Git Tag** if you want the step to clone code from a specific commit tag. Based on your selection, specify a **Branch Name** or **Tag Name**.

:::tip

You can use [fixed values, runtime input, or variable expressions](/docs/platform/variables-and-expressions/runtime-inputs/) for the branch and tag names. For example, you can enter `<+input>` for the branch or tag name to supply a branch or tag name at runtime. You could also use expressions to match the pipeline's [codebase](./create-and-configure-a-codebase.md) branch or tag so that, for example, the pipeline and the Git Clone step both pull code from the same environment, such as `production` when a production build runs or `development` when a development build runs.

:::

This setting applies only to the repo specified in this **Git Clone** step. It is separate from the `codebase` object for the pipeline's **Build** stage. If you want this **Git Clone** step's repo to use the same branch or commit as the primary codebase, specify either `<+codebase.branch>` or `<+codebase.tag>` for **Branch Name** or **Tag Name**. These expressions pull runtime input from the pipeline; for example, if the pipeline's primary codebase uses the `development` branch, then the **Git Clone** step clones the `development` branch from its repo. For more information, go to the [CI codebase variables reference](./built-in-cie-codebase-variables-reference.md).

### Clone Directory

An optional target path in the pipeline workspace where you want to clone the repo.

You can't specify `/harness/` as a target directory for a **Git Clone** step because this folder is reserved for the **Build** stage's [codebase](./create-and-configure-a-codebase.md). You can specify **Shared Paths** in your [CI Build stage settings](../set-up-build-infrastructure/ci-stage-settings.md) to share data across steps in your **Build** stage.

### Depth

The number of commits to fetch when the step clones the repo.

For manually-triggered builds, the default depth is `50`. This means each `git clone` operation fetches the 50 most recent commits. For all other trigger types, the default depth is `0`, which fetches all commits from the relevant branch.

For more information, go to the [git clone documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone).

### SSL Verify

If **True**, which is the default value, the pipeline verifies your Git SSL certificates. The build fails if the certificate check fails. Set this to **False** only if you have a known issue with the certificate and you are willing to run your builds anyway.

If you want to use self-signed certificates in a Kubernetes Cluster build infrastructure, go to [Configure a Kubernetes Build Farm to use Self-Signed Certificates](../set-up-build-infrastructure/k8s-build-infrastructure/configure-a-kubernetes-build-farm-to-use-self-signed-certificates.md)

### Run as User

This setting is available for Kubernetes cluster build infrastructures only.

All Git clone steps, including the default clone codebase step and any additional **Git Clone** steps, use user 1000 by default for Kubernetes.

If necessary, you can specify, in **Run as User**, a user ID to use to run all processes in the pod if running in containers. For more information, go to [Set the security context for a pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/#set-the-security-context-for-a-pod).

Specifying **Run as User** at the step level overrides **Run as User** in the [build infrastructure settings](../set-up-build-infrastructure/ci-stage-settings.md#infrastructure), if you had also specified it there.

### Set Container Resources

Set maximum resource limits for the resources used by the container at runtime:

* **Limit Memory:** The maximum memory that the container can use. You can express memory as a plain integer or as a fixed-point number using the suffixes `G` or `M`. You can also use the power-of-two equivalents `Gi` and `Mi`. The default is `500Mi`.
* **Limit CPU:** The maximum number of cores that the container can use. CPU limits are measured in CPU units. Fractional requests are allowed; for example, you can specify one hundred millicpu as `0.1` or `100m`. The default is `400m`. For more information, go to [Resource units in Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#resource-units-in-kubernetes).

### Timeout

Set the timeout limit for the step. Once the timeout limit is reached, the step fails and pipeline execution continues. To set skip conditions or failure handling for steps, go to:

* [Step Skip Condition settings](/docs/platform/pipelines/w_pipeline-steps-reference/step-skip-condition-settings.md)
* [Step Failure Strategy settings](/docs/platform/pipelines/w_pipeline-steps-reference/step-failure-strategy-settings.md)

### SSH-keyscan timeout

If your [connector](#connector) uses SSH authentication, you can add a `PLUGIN_SSH_KEYSCAN_TIMEOUT` [stage variable](/docs/platform/pipelines/add-a-stage/#stage-variables) to override the `ssh-keyscan` command's timeout limit (the default is `5s`).

Stage variables are configured in stage settings, not step settings.


<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Visual" label="Visual">


1. In your CI pipeline, select the stage with the **Git Clone** step, and then select the **Overview** tab.
2. Under **Advanced**, select **New Variable**.
3. For **Variable Name**, enter `PLUGIN_SSH_KEYSCAN_TIMEOUT`.
4. Set the **Type** to **String**, and then select **Save**.
5. Enter the desired timeout limit for the **Value**. This is an integer representing a number of seconds, such as `90`.


</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="YAML" label="YAML" default>


```yaml
    - stage:
        ...
        variables:
          - name: PLUGIN_SSH_KEYSCAN_TIMEOUT
            type: String
            description: ""
            value: 90
```


</TabItem>
</Tabs>


Add this variable to all stages where you need to override the `SSH-keyscan` timeout limit.


</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="run" label="Add a Run step">


You can use scripts in [Run steps](../run-ci-scripts/run-step-settings.md) to clone multiple repos into a stage.

For example, this step clones a GitHub repository.

```yaml
              - step:
                  type: Run
                  identifier: clone
                  name: clone
                  spec:
                    shell: Sh
                    command: |-
                      git clone https://GH_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN@github.com/ACCOUNT_NAME/REPO_NAME.git
```

To use this command, you would replace:

* `ACCOUNT_NAME` with your GitHub account name.
* `REPO_NAME` with the name of the GitHub repo to clone.
* `PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` with a [GitHub personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) that has pull permissions to the target repository. Additional permissions may be necessary depending on the Action's purpose. Store the token as a [Harness secret](/docs/category/secrets) and use a variable expression, such as `<+secrets.getValue("YOUR_TOKEN_SECRET")>`, to call it.

For information about **Run** step settings, go to [Use Run steps](../run-ci-scripts/run-step-settings.md).

## Build an artifact from both code repos

Now that the files from both repos will be cloned into a common workspace, you can add a step to build an image using code from both repos, such as a [Build and Push to Docker step](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/build-and-upload-artifacts/build-and-push-to-docker-hub-step-settings).

Pay attention to settings like the [Dockerfile setting](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/build-and-upload-artifacts/build-and-push-to-docker-hub-step-settings#dockerfile) that assume files are located at the codebase's root directory if not otherwise specified. This is because the pipeline's default codebase files are cloned in the root folder (`/harness`), while other codebase files are cloned into subfolders.

Depending on the default codebase, you might need to specify a non-root path for build files. You can also use commands, such as `cp`, in [Run steps](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/run-ci-scripts/run-step-settings) to move cloned files around the workspace before building the image.

## YAML examples

  <TabItem value="run" label="Example with Run step">


This example clones app code as the [default codebase](#configure-the-default-codebase) and then uses a **Run** step to clone a separate repo that has the Dockerfile necessary to build the app.

Due to the build infrastructure and the `image` used for the **Run** step, it is necessary to install Git before cloning the additional repo. The **Run** step uses the following commands to install Git, verify that it's working, and then clone the repo that has the Dockerfile needed to build the app.

```
apk add git
git --version
git clone https://github.com/$GITHUB_USERNAME/$DOCKERFILE_REPO_NAME
```

This example also uses [stage variables](../set-up-build-infrastructure/ci-stage-settings.md#advanced-stage-variables), such as `$GITHUB_USERNAME` to reference account and repo names. These variables are accessible across all steps in the stage.
