This topic describes how you can cache and share data across steps, stages, and builds.

## Share data between steps in a stage

When a pipeline runs, it creates a temporary volume called a *workspace*. During initialization, the stage clones your codebase to the root of the workspace. Then, the steps in the stage run inside the root. The workspace is a volume that persists for the lifetime of the stage and enables steps in that stage to communicate and share state information. The workspace is destroyed when the stage ends.

The workspace is the current working directory for each step in the stage, and the default shared working directory for any stage is `/harness`. Any step in the stage can create, retrieve, update, and delete files in this folder. If you need to share additional volumes between steps in the stage, you can add **Shared Paths** in the [Build stage settings](../set-up-build-infrastructure/ci-stage-settings.md). Paths must begin with a forward slash, such as `/vol`. <!-- resolves as `/vol/harness`? -->

For example, the maven `m2` repo is stored in `/root/.m2` by default, which is outside the `/harness` directory. If your Build stage uses Maven, you can specify `/root/.m2` as a **Shared Path** so that all steps in that stage can access that directory.

## Share data across stages

You can use the following caching methods to share data across stages:

* [Harness Cache Intelligence](./cache-intelligence.md)
* [Save and Restore Caches from S3 buckets](saving-cache.md)
* [Save and Restore Caches from GCS buckets](save-cache-in-gcs.md)

You cannot share access credentials or other [Text Secrets](/docs/platform/secrets/add-use-text-secrets) across stages.

If you need to maintain a long-running service for the duration of a stage, use a [Background step](../manage-dependencies/background-step-settings.md).

## Use caching to reduce build time

Use the following caching methods to reduce build time:

* [Harness Cache Intelligence](./cache-intelligence.md)
* [Save and Restore Caches from S3 buckets](saving-cache.md)
* [Save and Restore Caches from GCS buckets](save-cache-in-gcs.md)

You cannot share access credentials or other [Text Secrets](/docs/platform/secrets/add-use-text-secrets) with caching.

:::tip Multilayer caching

For multilayer caching, use multiple **Restore Cache** and **Save Cache** steps according to the pattern described in [Multilayer caching](./multilayer-caching.md).

## Remote Docker cache

Remote Docker caching can dramatically improve build times by sharing data across pipelines, stages, and steps. Remote caching leverages your exising Docker registry to pull previously built layers.

Remote caching isn't available for all build infrastructures. If available for your build infrastructure, you can enable the **Remote Cache Image** option in the following steps:

* [Build and Push to Docker](../build-and-upload-artifacts/build-and-push-to-docker-hub-step-settings.md)
* [Build and Push to ECR](../build-and-upload-artifacts/build-and-push-to-ecr-step-settings.md)
* [Build and Push to GAR](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/build-and-upload-artifacts/build-and-push-to-gar.md)
* [Build and Push to GCR](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/build-and-upload-artifacts/build-and-push-to-gcr.md)
* [Build and Push to ACR](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/build-and-upload-artifacts/build-and-push-to-acr.md)

:::info

Harness Cloud can manage the Docker layer cache backend for you, without relying on your Docker registry, which can further reduce build times. To learn more, go to [Docker Layer Caching](./docker-layer-caching.md).
