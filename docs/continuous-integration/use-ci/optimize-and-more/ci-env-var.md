This topic describes the Harness CI built-in environment variables<!--, particularly those prefixed by `DRONE_`, as well as some `HARNESS_` variables and other environment variables relevant to CI-->. These variables contain information about the build, such as how the build started, codebase information, build infrastructure, step identifiers, and more. These are [pipeline variables](/docs/platform/variables-and-expressions/harness-variables#pipeline), and they are available to all stages and steps in the pipeline.

## Reference environment variables

You can reference Harness CI environment variables through:

* Direct reference in shell commands, when available, such as `HARNESS_BUILD_ID`.
* Equivalent [Harness expressions](/docs/platform/Variables-and-Expressions/harness-variables), such as `<+pipeline.sequenceId>` for `HARNESS_BUILD_ID`, or many of the [CI codebase expressions](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/codebase-configuration/built-in-cie-codebase-variables-reference).

## Variable resolution

The value of environment variables depends on the build conditions. A variable is resolved only if the build includes the necessary information for that variable. <!--For example, `DRONE_PULL_REQUEST` is only resolved if the build started from a pull request. Builds that aren't started from a PR won't have a PR number to assign to that variable.-->

### Manual builds

Manual builds occur when you manually run a pipeline from within Harness. You can select a branch, PR, or tag to build.

* **Manual branch builds:** Manually run a pipeline and select the **Git Branch** build type. Harness looks for the source code attached to the specified **Branch Name**, and it clones that specific source code for the build.
* **Manual pull request (PR) builds**: Manually run a pipeline and select the **Git Pull Request** build type. Harness looks for the source code attached to the specified **Pull Request Number**, and it clones that specific source code for the build.
* **Manual tag builds:** Manually run a pipeline and select the **Git Tag** build type. Harness looks for the source code attached to the specified **Tag Name**, and it clones that specific source code for the build.

### Webhook triggers

You can automatically [trigger pipelines using Git events](/docs/platform/Triggers/triggering-pipelines). [Webhook triggers](/docs/platform/triggers/triggers-reference) listen for specific events in your code repo, and then trigger builds when those events occur.

* **Pull request (PR) triggers:** A **Pull Request Webhook Event** automatically starts a build in Harness when there is a new pull request event on the pipeline's associated Git repo. You can specify the type of [pull request events](/docs/platform/triggers/triggers-reference#event-and-actions) to track, such as close, open, update/edit, reopen, and so on.
* **Push triggers:** A **Push Webhook Event** automatically starts a build in Harness when there is a new branch or tag push event on the pipeline's associated Git repo.

<!-- H2 Difference between DRONE\_ and PLUGIN\_ variables

`DRONE_` variables are environment variables that are automatically set at the pipeline level. These are [pipeline variables](/docs/platform/variables-and-expressions/harness-variables#pipeline), and they are available to all stages and steps in the pipeline. You might notice that many `DRONE_` variables are the same as some `CI_` and `HARNESS_` environment variables. The `DRONE_` variables are derived from Drone, which is part of Harness CI. Providing first-class support for [Drone environment variables](https://docs.drone.io/pipeline/environment/reference/) makes it easier to migrate from standalone Drone to Harness CI and provides better support for [Drone plugins](../use-drone-plugins/explore-ci-plugins.md) that use those variables.

`PLUGIN_` variables represent [plugin](../use-drone-plugins/explore-ci-plugins.md) settings, and they are defined in either:

* The [plugin step's settings](../use-drone-plugins/plugin-step-settings-reference.md#settings). For example, `setting.url` becomes `PLUGIN_URL` at runtime.
* Stage variables. For example, you can use the `PLUGIN_DRY_RUN` stage variable to [Build a Docker image without pushing](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/build-and-upload-artifacts/build-without-push.md).-->

<!-- ## Codebase and trigger variables

These variables contain codebase attributes and information about how builds start (triggers). For more information about codebase attributes and expressions you can use to reference codebase attributes, go to the [CI codebase variables reference](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/codebase-configuration/built-in-cie-codebase-variables-reference).

### DRONE_BRANCH

For branch builds and PR builds, this variable's value is the target branch for the build.

For tag push webhook triggers, this variable's value is the tag reference, such as `refs/tags/TAG_NAME`.

For manual tag builds, this variable is not applicable and can be empty.

Depending on the build type, this can be equivalent to the expressions `<+codebase.targetBranch>` or `<+codebase.branch>`.

This variable is similar to [`DRONE_COMMIT_BRANCH`](#drone_commit_branch) and [`DRONE_TARGET_BRANCH`](#drone_target_branch).

### DRONE_BUILD_ACTION

Only applicable to [PR webhook triggers](#webhook-triggers), this variable describes the PR event that triggered the build, such as `open` or `reopen`.

For all other build types, this variable is not applicable.

This variable is similar, but not equivalent, to the expression `<+trigger.event>`.

Possible values include: a unique commit SHA, the same SHA as [`DRONE_COMMIT`](#drone_commit), empty, or all zeros.

### DRONE_COMMIT_BRANCH

For branch builds and PR builds, this variable's value is the target branch for the build.

For tag push webhook triggers, this variable's value is the tag reference, such as `refs/tags/TAG_NAME`.

For manual tag builds, this variable is not applicable and can be empty.

Depending on the build type, this can be equivalent to the expressions `<+codebase.targetBranch>` or `<+codebase.branch>`.

This variable is similar to [`DRONE_BRANCH`](#drone_branch) and [`DRONE_TARGET_BRANCH`](#drone_target_branch).

### DRONE_COMMIT_LINK

Provides a link to the commit, PR, or tag in SCM.

For PR builds, this is equivalent to the expression `<+codebase.pullRequestLink>`.

### DRONE_COMMIT_MESSAGE

Provides a Git reference corresponding to the branch, tag, or PR. For example:

* Branch reference: `refs/heads/main`
* Tag reference: `refs/tags/v1.0.0`
* PR reference: `refs/pull/1/head`

For manual builds, this can be empty.

This is similar to `<+codebase.commitRef>`.

### DRONE_COMMIT_SHA

The Git commit SHA of the Git commit associated with the build, such as the most recent commit to a branch, PR, or tag. Corresponds with the expressions `<+codebase.commitSha>` or `<+trigger.commitSha>`.

`DRONE_REPO_LINK` is different from [`DRONE_GIT_HTTP_URL`](#drone_git_http_url), which is formatted to clone the repo.

### DRONE_REPO_NAME

Provides only the name of the repo associated with the build, such as `hello-world` in `octocat/hello-world`. By comparison, [DRONE_REPO](#drone_repo) includes both the account/organization namespace and repo name, and [`DRONE_REPO_NAMESPACE`](#drone_repo_namespace) includes only the namespace.

### DRONE_REPO_NAMESPACE

### DRONE_REPO_PRIVATE

A Boolean that indicates whether the repository is private or not.

If `true`, the repo is private.
If `false`, the repo is public.

It defaults to `true` for manual builds, regardless of actual privacy.

Similar to [`DRONE_REPO_VISIBILITY`](#drone_repo_visibility).

### DRONE_REPO_SCM

Identifies the SCM provider, such as `Github`.

### DRONE_REPO_VISIBILITY

Describes repo visibility as `public`, `private`, or `internal`.

It defaults to `private` for manual builds, regardless of actual visibility.

Similar to [`DRONE_REPO_PRIVATE`](#drone_repo_private).

### DRONE_SEMVER

Only applicable to tag builds. If the Git tag is a valid [semantic version](https://semver.org/) string, this value represents the tag as a valid semver string, such as `1.2.3-alpha.1`.

Harness CI also supports these `DRONE_SEMVER` variations:

* `DRONE_SEMVER_MAJOR`: Provides the major version number from the semver string, such as `1` in `1.2.3`.
* `DRONE_SEMVER_MINOR`: Provides the minor version number from the semver string, such as `2` in `1.2.3`.
* `DRONE_SEMVER_PATCH`: Provides the patch number from the semver string, such as `3` in `1.2.3`.
* `DRONE_SEMVER_PRERELEASE`: Provides the prelease value from the semver string, such as `alpha.1` in `1.2.3-alpha.1`.
* `DRONE_SEMVER_SHORT`: Provides the short version of the semver string with truncated labels and metadata,such as `1.2.3` in `1.2.3-alpha.1`.
* `DRONE_SEMVER_BUILD`: Provides the build from the semver string, such as `001` in `1.2.3+001`.
* `DRONE_SEMVER_ERROR`: Provides the semver parsing error if the tag is *not* a valid semver string.

### DRONE_SOURCE_BRANCH

For PR builds, this value provides the PR source branch. You can use this value along with [`DRONE_TARGET_BRANCH`](#drone_target_branch) to get the PR base and head branches.

For branch builds, this value can be the same as [`DRONE_BRANCH`](#drone_branch) or [`DRONE_COMMIT_BRANCH`](#drone_commit_branch).

For tag push webhook triggers, this variable's value is the tag reference, such as `refs/tags/TAG_NAME`

For manual tag builds, this variable can be empty.

Depending on the build type, this value can be equivalent to the expressions `<+codebase.sourceBranch>` and `<+trigger.sourceBranch>`.

This variable is similar to [`DRONE_BRANCH`](#drone_branch) and [`DRONE_COMMIT_BRANCH`](#drone_commit_branch).

### DRONE_TAG

For tag builds, this is the tag associated with the build. It is equivalent to `<+codebase.tag>`.

### DRONE_TARGET_BRANCH

For branch builds and PR builds, this variable's value is the target branch for the build. You can use this value along with [`DRONE_SOURCE_BRANCH`](#drone_source_branch) to get the PR base and head branches.

For tag push webhook triggers, this variable's value is the tag reference, such as `refs/tags/TAG_NAME`.

For manual tag builds, this variable is not applicable and can be empty.

This can be equivalent to the expressions `<+codebase.targetBranch>` or `<+trigger.targetBranch>`.

This variable is similar to [`DRONE_BRANCH`](#drone_branch) and [`DRONE_COMMIT_BRANCH`](#drone_commit_branch).

## Timestamp variables

These variables provide unix timestamps.

* `DRONE_BUILD_CREATED`: The unix timestamp indicating the time the build object (the execution instance) was created.
* `DRONE_BUILD_FINISHED`: Provides the unix timestamp for when the build is finished. However, a running build cannot have a finish timestamp, therefore, the system always sets this value to the same as `DRONE_BUILD_CREATED`.
* `DRONE_BUILD_STARTED`: Provides the unix timestamp for when the build was started by the system. Equivalent to `<+pipeline.startTs>`, and the same as `DRONE_BUILD_CREATED`.
* `DRONE_STAGE_FINISHED`: Provides the unix timestamp for when the stage ends. However, a running stage cannot have a finish timestamp, therefore, the system always sets this value to the same as `DRONE_STAGE_STARTED`.
* `DRONE_STAGE_STARTED`: Provides the unix timestamp for when a stage started.

If the pipeline's first stage is a CI stage, all timestamps are the same. -->
