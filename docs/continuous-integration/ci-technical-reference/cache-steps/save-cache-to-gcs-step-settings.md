This topic provides settings and permissions for the **Save Cache to GCS** step, which is used to store a cache of files and directories in a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket.

For more information about caching in CI pipelines, go to:

* [Save and Restore Cache from GCS](../../use-ci/caching-ci-data/save-cache-in-gcs.md)
* [Share CI data across steps and stages](../../use-ci/caching-ci-data/share-ci-data-across-steps-and-stages.md)
* [Cache Intelligence](../../use-ci/caching-ci-data/cache-intelligence.md)

:::info

Depending on the stage's build infrastructure, some settings may be unavailable.

:::

## Name

Enter a name summarizing the step's purpose. Harness automatically assigns an **Id** ([Entity Identifier Reference](../../../platform/20_References/entity-identifier-reference.md)) based on the **Name**. You can change the **Id**.

## GCP Connector

The Harness connector for the GCP account where you want to save the cache. For more information, go to [Google Cloud Platform (GCP) connector settings reference](/docs/platform/Connectors/Cloud-providers/ref-cloud-providers/gcs-connector-settings-reference).

This step supports GCP connectors that use access key authentication. It does not support GCP connectors that inherit delegate credentials.

## Bucket

The GCS destination bucket name.

## Key

The key to identify the cache.

You can use the checksum macro to create a key based on a file's checksum, for example: `myApp-{{ checksum filePath1 }}`

With this macro, Harness checks if the key exists and compares the checksum. If the checksum matches, then Harness doesn't save the cache. If the checksum is different, then Harness saves the cache.

The backslash character isn't allowed as part of the checksum value here. This is a limitation of the Go language (golang) template. You must use a forward slash instead.

* Incorrect format: `cache-{{ checksum ".\src\common\myproj.csproj" }`
* Correct format: `cache-{{ checksum "./src/common/myproj.csproj" }}`

## Source Paths

A list of the files/folders to cache. Add each file/folder separately.

## Optional Configuration

Use the following settings to add additional configuration to the step. Settings specific to containers, such as **Set Container Resources**, are not applicable when using the step in a stage with VM or Harness Cloud build infrastructure.

### Archive Format

Select the archive format. The default archive format is Tar.

### Override Cache

Select this option if you want to override the cache if a cache with a matching **Key** already exists.

By default, the **Override Cache** option is set to false (unselected).

### Run as User

Specify the user ID to use to run all processes in the pod if running in containers. For more information, go to [Set the security context for a pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/#set-the-security-context-for-a-pod).

### Set Container Resources

Maximum resources limits for the resources used by the container at runtime:

* **Limit Memory:** Maximum memory that the container can use. You can express memory as a plain integer or as a fixed-point number with the suffixes `G` or `M`. You can also use the power-of-two equivalents, `Gi` or `Mi`. Do not include spaces when entering a fixed value. The default is `500Mi`.
* **Limit CPU:** The maximum number of cores that the container can use. CPU limits are measured in CPU units. Fractional requests are allowed. For example, you can specify one hundred millicpu as `0.1` or `100m`. For more information, go to [Resource units in Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#resource-units-in-kubernetes).

### Timeout

Set the timeout limit for the step. Once the timeout limit is reached, the step fails and pipeline execution continues. To set skip conditions or failure handling for steps, go to:

* [Step Skip Condition settings](../../../platform/8_Pipelines/w_pipeline-steps-reference/step-skip-condition-settings.md)
* [Step Failure Strategy settings](../../../platform/8_Pipelines/w_pipeline-steps-reference/step-failure-strategy-settings.md)
