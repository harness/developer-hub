This topic provides settings for the Save Cache to S3 step, which preserves files and directories between builds.

To restore a saved cache, add a [Restore Cache from S3 step](restore-cache-from-s-3-step-settings.md) to your pipeline.

:::info

Depending on the stage's build infrastructure, some settings may be unavailable.

:::

## Name

Enter a name summarizing the step's purpose. Harness automatically assigns an **Id** ([Entity Identifier Reference](../../platform/20_References/entity-identifier-reference.md)) based on the **Name**. You can change the **Id**.

## AWS Connector

The Harness AWS connector to use when saving the cache to S3. The AWS IAM roles and policies associated with the account used in the Harness AWS Connector must be able to write to S3.

:::note

This step supports AWS connectors using **AWS Access Key**, **Assume IAM role on Delegate**, and IRSA authentication methods *without* cross-account access (ARN/STS).

This step doesn't support AWS connectors that have enabled cross-account access (ARN/STS) for any authentication method.

:::

For more information about roles and permissions for AWS connectors, go to:

* [Add an AWS connector](../../platform/7_Connectors/add-aws-connector.md)
* [AWS connector settings reference](../../platform/7_Connectors/ref-cloud-providers/aws-connector-settings-reference.md).

## Region

Define the AWS region to use when saving the cache, such as the AWS region you selected when you created the AWS S3 bucket. For more information go to the AWS documentation:

* [Creating, configuring, and working with Amazon S3 buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/create-configure-bucket.html)
* [Pushing a Docker image to an Amazon ECR repository](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/docker-push-ecr-image.html)

## Bucket

The AWS S3 bucket where you want to save the cache.

## Key

The key to identify the cache.

You can use the checksum macro to create a key based on a file's checksum, for example: `myApp-{{ checksum filePath1 }}`

With this macro, Harness checks if the key exists and compares the checksum. If the checksum matches, then Harness doesn't save the cache. If the checksum is different, then Harness saves the cache.

The backslash character isn't allowed as part of the checksum value here. This is a limitation of the Go language (golang) template. You must use a forward slash instead.

* Incorrect format: `cache-{{ checksum ".\src\common\myproj.csproj" }`
* Correct format: `cache-{{ checksum "./src/common/myproj.csproj" }}`

## Source Paths

A list of the files/folders to cache. Add each file/folder separately.

## Optional Configuration

Use the following settings to add additional configuration to the step. Settings specific to containers, such as **Set Container Resources**, are not applicable when using the step in a stage with VM or Harness Cloud build infrastructure.

### Endpoint URL

Endpoint URL for S3-compatible providers. This setting is not needed for AWS.

### Archive Format

Select the archive format. The default archive format is Tar.

### Override Cache

Select this option if you want to override the cache if a cache with a matching **Key** already exists.

By default, the **Override Cache** option is set to false (unselected).

### Path Style

If unselected, the step uses Virtual Hosted Style for paths, such as `http://bucket.host/key`. If selected, the step uses Path Style, such as `http://host/bucket/key`.

For MinIO, you must use Path Style. Make sure **Path Style** is true (selected).

By default, **Path Style** is false (unselected).

### Run as User

Specify the user ID to use to run all processes in the pod if running in containers. For more information, go to [Set the security context for a pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/#set-the-security-context-for-a-pod).

### Set Container Resources

Maximum resources limits for the resources used by the container at runtime:

* **Limit Memory:** Maximum memory that the container can use. You can express memory as a plain integer or as a fixed-point number with the suffixes `G` or `M`. You can also use the power-of-two equivalents, `Gi` or `Mi`. Do not include spaces when entering a fixed value. The default is `500Mi`.
* **Limit CPU:** The maximum number of cores that the container can use. CPU limits are measured in CPU units. Fractional requests are allowed. For example, you can specify one hundred millicpu as `0.1` or `100m`. For more information, go to [Resource units in Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#resource-units-in-kubernetes).

### Timeout

Set the timeout limit for the step. Once the timeout limit is reached, the step fails and pipeline execution continues. To set skip conditions or failure handling for steps, go to:

* [Step Skip Condition settings](../../platform/8_Pipelines/w_pipeline-steps-reference/step-skip-condition-settings.md)
* [Step Failure Strategy settings](../../platform/8_Pipelines/w_pipeline-steps-reference/step-failure-strategy-settings.md)
