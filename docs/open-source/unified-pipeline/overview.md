This folder will be used to store work in progess drafts, thoughts, and work for unified pipeline docs. 

# Notes

For now, keep it all in one page for pipeline syntax

I've used [Q] to signify a question or quality issue.

Should we shrink yaml examples down to just their individual component sections instead of giving an entire pipeline sample?
- Do full yaml examples instead of partials. 

We need to check all the examples to check if they are authentic.



# TODO:

Ensure that we make a global keyword section

Need to define a UI design direction. 

Move up `container`, `script`, maybe `shell`, and `env` up a level. 

StepQueue and StepTemplate still not defined. 

Add [*] to all steps
