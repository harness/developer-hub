Gitspaces are on-demand, pre-configured, secure remote development environments (Gitspacesâ„¢) that reduce toil in the development inner loop and make developers happy.

We currently support the following Git providers and IDEs:

## Git Providers

1. **Harness Open Source** public and private repositories
2. **GitHub** public repositories
3. **Bitbucket** public repositories
4. **GitLab** public repositories

:::info

To create Gitspaces for **private repositories** on GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab, you will first need to [import](/docs/open-source/repositories/overview#import-a-repository) the repository into Harness Open Source.

:::

## IDEs

1. **VS Code Desktop** (via [VS Code Plugin](/docs/open-source/gitspaces/ide's/vs-code-desktop.md))
2. **VS Code Browser**
