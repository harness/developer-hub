VS Code Browser can directly be started on your browser and doesn't require any pre-configuration.

This guide will take you through the steps required to access your Harness Open Source Gitspace in your VS Code Browser:
1. You can start by creating a new Gitspace from the Harness Open Source UI. (check the quickstart guide for more details) Please ensure that while creating one, you choose “VS Code Browser” as the selected IDE.
