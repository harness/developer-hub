# Overview

Harness Open Source is an end-to-end open source software development platform from [Harness](https://www.harness.io/) that unifies managing your [source code repositories](/docs/category/repositories), [CI/CD pipelines](/docs/open-source/pipelines/overview), [hosted development environments](/docs/category/gitspaces), and [artifact management](/docs/category/registries).

Hereâ€™s a short overview of the capabilities:

- Code Repository - Create and share source code in Git repositories, perform code reviews, and scan for vulnerabilities.
- Hosted Development Environments - Set up preconfigured, secure, ready-to-use development environments that can be easily shared with others. Develop from anywhere using your favorite IDE without hosting or managing any code locally.
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery - Build, test, and deploy code faster with hundreds of reusable pipeline templates.
- Artifact Registry - Centralize and streamline software delivery pipelines by providing a single source of truth for software artifacts.

## How is Harness Open Source related to Drone?

Harness and Drone have merged, and the repository has been [renamed](https://github.com/harness/harness) to reflect this. If you are using **Drone 2.0**, you would upgrade to **Drone 3.0**, now known as Harness Open Source.

For users who need enterprise-grade features such as high availability (HA), role-based access control (RBAC), and governance, the paid offering of Harness Open Source is available as part of the Harness Platform.

### Migration from Drone to Harness Open Source
The migration process is designed to be seamless, with Harness handling the transition and required resourcing. If you are currently using Drone and looking to migrate, please contact your account team for details.
