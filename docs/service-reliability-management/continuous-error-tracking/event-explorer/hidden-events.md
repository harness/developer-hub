You can hide events from the **Events** page. When you mark an event as "hidden", it will be moved to the **Hidden Events** page and no longer appear on the Events page.



## Mark an event as hidden

To mark an event as hidden:

1. In your Harness project, navigate to **Service Reliability Management** and select **Code Errors**.    
   List of all the services monitored by Continuous Error Tracking is displayed.

2. Select a monitored service for which you want to view the events.

3. On the Events page, select the events that you want to mark as hidden and then select **Hide Events**.

   The selected events will be moved to the **Hidden Events** page and will no longer appear on the Events page.
