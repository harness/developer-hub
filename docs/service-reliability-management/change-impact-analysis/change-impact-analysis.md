# Change impact analysis overview

Harness Change Impact Analysis enables you to understand what has changed, when it changed, why it changed, and the effect it had on your monitored service. It helps you identify recent change events in your service around the time performance deteriorated. These changes might include deployments, infrastructure changes, incidents, feature flags, and chaos experiments. This real-time change event tracking aids in faster root cause analysis and allows teams to make confident decisions.

## Prerequisites

- Create a monitored service in Harness SRM. To learn how to create a monitored service, go to [Create a monitored service](../monitored-service/create-monitored-service.md).

- Add a change source to the monitored service. To learn about the change sources supported by Harness and how to add them to a monitored service, go to [Change sources catalog](/docs/category/change-sources-catalog).

- Add a health source to the monitored service. To learn about the health sources supported by Harness and how to add them to a monitored service, go to [Health sources catalog](/docs/category/health-sources-catalog).

## Next steps

Use the [Service Health dashboard](change-impact-analysis-service-health-dashboard.md) and [Changes dashboard](change-impact-analysis-changes-dash-board.md) to correlate change events and understand their impact on the monitored service.
