The Changes dashboard provides a quick overview of change events from multiple change sources. A change source is a system that generates change events whenever a change is recorded. Change events are grouped in one location, enabling you to see how a certain change affects the rest of the system.

The Changes dashboard helps you understand when the change occurred, why it took place, and what impact it had on the health of the monitored service.

Perform the following step to go to the Changes dashboard:

1. In your Harness project, navigate to the **Service Reliability** module, and then select **Changes**.  
   The Changes dashboard appears.

The Changes dashboard is divided into the following sections:

- Filters
- Changes Timeline
- Changes list

- **Services**: Select the monitored service for which you want to see changes. You can select multiple monitored services.
- **Environments**: Select the environment for which you want to see changes. You can select multiple environments.
- **Change Types**: Select the type of change source for which you want to see changes. The available filters are **Deployment**, **Infrastructure**, **Incidents**, **Feature Flags**, and **Chaos Experiment**.
- **Sources**: Select the source for which you want to see changes. For example, **Harness CD NextGen**, **Harness CD**, **Kubernetes**, **PagerDuty**, **Harness FF** (Harness Feature Flag), and **Harness CE** (Harness Chaos Experiment). You can select multiple change sources.
