Harness helps you evaluate the impact of your deployment on the service health of a monitored service.

## Analyze Deployment Impact step

Harness Continuous Deployment (CD) includes the **Analyze Deployment Impact** step. When you execute a deployment pipeline that has the Analyze Deployment Impact step added, Harness analyzes the impact of deployment on the health of the monitored service (associated with the Analyze Deployment Impact step) and generates an Impact Analysis Report.

## Impact Analysis Report

The Impact Analysis Report includes the following information:

  - **Report name:** This is derived from the Analyze Deployment Impact step name. For example, "Impact Analysis Report: AnalyzeDeploymentImpact_1".
    
  - **Service and environment:** Details about the specific service and environment where the deployment was executed.
    
  - **User information:** Information about the user who initiated the deployment and when it was executed.
    
  - **Analysis duration:** The duration for which the analysis was carried out.
    
  - **Start and end times:** The date and time when the analysis started and when it concluded.
    
  - **Analysis status:** The status of the analysis, which can be one of the following: **Running**, **Completed**, or **Aborted**.
    
  - **Service health and SLO performance:** Service health score and SLO performance trend chart for the duration of the analysis.

## Add Analyze Deployment Impact step to a deployment stage

To see the Impact Analysis Report, you need to add the "Analyze Deployment Impact" step to your deployment pipeline. There are multiple ways to add this step, depending on whether you're building a new deployment stage or modifying an existing one.

To add the **Analyze Deployment Impact** step to your pipeline, use one of the methods below.


### Add to a new deployment stage

If you're building a deployment stage and are currently on the **Execution** tab follow these steps:

1. Select **Add Step**.  
    The Step Library page appears.

    <DocImage path={require('./static/analyze-deployment-add-step.png')} />

2. In the **Service Reliability** section, select **Analyze Deployment Impact**.  
   
   The Analyze Deployment Impact settings page appears.


### Add to an existing deployment stage

To include the **Analyze Deployment Impact** step into an existing deployment stage, perform the following steps:

1. Select the stage where you want to add the Analyze Deployment Impact step.
   
2. On the stage settings pane, select the **Execution** tab.

3. In the stage, select **Add Step** where you want to add the Analyze Deployment Impact step.
   
   The Step Library page appears. You can add a step at various points in the pipeline, such as the beginning, end, in between existing steps, or below an existing step. Simply choose the location where you want to add the step and follow the prompts to add it.

4. In the **Service Reliability** section, select **Analyze Deployment Impact**.  
   
   The Analyze Deployment Impact settings page appears.


### Configure Analyze Deployment Impact step settings

The Analyze Deployment Impact settings page displays various options to configure **Analyze Deployment Impact** step.

 <DocImage path={require('./static/analyze-deployment-add-step-settings.png')} />

Following are the steps to configure the **Analyze Deployment Impact** step settings:

1. On the Analyze Deployment Impact settings page, go to the **Step Parameters** tab, and do the following:

2. **Name**: Harness automatically assigns a name for the **Analyze Deployment Impact** step. For example, if you are adding the **Analyze Deployment Impact** step for the first time, the default name would be "AnalyzeDeploymentImpact_1" and if you are adding the **Analyze Deployment Impact** step for the first time, the default name would be "AnalyzeDeploymentImpact_2".
   
3. Select how long Harness should run the analysis. The minimum duration is one day, and the maximum duration is 5 days.
   
4. In **Timeout**, enter a timeout value for the step. Harness uses this information to time out the analysis. Use the following syntax to define a timeout:

   - **w** for weeks. For example, to define one week, enter 1w.
   - **d** for days. For example, to define 7 days, enter 7d.
   - **h** for hours. For example, to define 24 hours, enter 24h.
   - **m** for minutes, For example, to define 100 minutes, enter 100m.
   - **s** for seconds. For example, to define 500 seconds, enter 500s.
   - **ms** for milliseconds. For example, to define 1000 milliseconds, enter 1000ms.

   You can also set timeouts at the pipeline level.
   
5. Choose a **Monitored Service** from the dropdown list to assess the impact of your deployment on the service's health.
   
   By default, the dropdown pre-selects the monitored service that corresponds to the service and environment you are currently deploying updates to. However, you can also select a different monitored service from the list if you want to analyze the impact of deployment on the health of that specific monitored service.

   **Example**

   Suppose you are deploying updates to your "Payments" monitored service. In the **Monitored Service** dropdown list, it will be displayed as **Default (Payments)**. This option will already be selected, indicating that Harness analyzes the impact of your deployment on the health of the **Payments** monitored service for the chosen duration in the Analyze Deployment step.
   
   Now, let's say you want to assess how your deployment might affect the health of your **Checkout** monitored service. To do this, simply select **Checkout** from the dropdown.

   When you select a monitored service, the health source and the notifications configured for that monitored service are displayed. 
   
6. Optionally, you can also configure health sources or notifications:

      - **Health source**: To configure a health source, select the **Configure Health Source** link. This opens a new tab, taking you to the health source configuration page of the monitored service that you selected. To learn about how to configure a health source, go to [Add a health source](../monitored-service/create-monitored-service.md#add-a-health-source).
   
      - **Notifications**: You can configure notifications for monitored services. Your team receives alerts whenever the deployment pipeline that is associated with the monitored service is executed.  
      To configure notifications, select the **Configure notifications** link. This opens a new tab, taking you to the Notifications page of the monitored service that you selected. To learn about how to configure notifications, go to [Monitored service notifications](../notifications/monitoredservice-notifications.md).
  
   
   :::important
   When configuring the notification rule, ensure that, on the Conditions page, you select **Deployment Impact Analysis** from the **Conditions** dropdown list.
         
   :::


7. Select **Apply Changes** to save the Analyze Deployment Impact step settings.  
   The Analyze Deployment Impact step is added to the deployment.

 
## View Analyze Deployment Impact step results

When you run the deployment pipeline, Harness runs the Analyze Deployment Impact step and generates results.

:::info note
When the **Analyze Deployment Impact** step is running, the status is displayed as **Running**. You can select **Abort** to stop the step.
