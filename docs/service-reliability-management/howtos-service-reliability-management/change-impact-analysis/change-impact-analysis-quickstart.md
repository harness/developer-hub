Harness Change Impact Analysis enables you to understand what has changed, when it changed, why it changed, and the effect it had on your monitored service. It helps you identify recent change events in your service around the time performance deteriorated. These changes might include deployments, infrastructure changes, incidents, and feature flags. This real-time change event tracking aids in faster root cause analysis and allows teams to make confident decisions.

This topic describes how to create a monitored service to correlate change events.


## Prerequisites

- Ensure that you have installed a Delegate and it can communicate with Harness, the health source, and the change source. To learn more about delegates, go to [Get started with delegates](https://developer.harness.io/docs/category/delegate-concepts).
- Create an organization if you have not already created one. To learn more about organizations in Harness, go to [Create organizations and projects](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/organizations-and-projects/create-an-organization).

## Create a project
To create a project, perform the following steps:

1. In Harness, select **Service Reliability** > **Create Project**.
   ![Create Project](./static/change-impact-create-project-navigate.png)
2. On the **About the Project** page, do the following, and then select **Save and Continue**: 
   - **Name**: Enter a name for the project.
   - **Color**: Select a color theme for the project.
   - **Organization**: Select an organization for the project. If you don't yet have an organization in Harness, and want to learn how to create one, go to [Create a Harness Org](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/organizations-and-projects/create-an-organization#step-1-create-a-harness-org).
3. On the **Invite Collaborators (Optional)** page, in the **Invite People to Collaborate** field, add team members to the project.
4. In the **Role** field, assign a role to the collaborators.
5. Select **Add**.
6. Select **Save and Continue**.  
   Your project is created.


## Create a monitored service

A monitored service is a logical entity that combines a Harness service and environment. The service could be a microservice or any other workload that can be monitored. Environments represent your deployment targets such as QA, prod, and so on.

The following steps explain how to create a monitored service in Harness.


### Navigate to the "Create new monitored service" page

To create a monitored service:

1. In your Harness project, navigate to the **Service Reliability** module, and then select **Monitored Services** > **+ New Monitored Service**.

![Navigate to new monitored services page](./static/change-impact-moniterdservice-navigate.png)

The Create new monitored service page appears.


### Define the monitored service

1. In the **Overview** section, enter the following information:
    * **Type**: Select **Application**.
    * **Create or select a Service**: Do one of the following:
     
       * If the service that you want to monitor exists, select it.
       * If you want to create a service, select **+ Add New**, enter the following information, and then select **Save**. 
       
          *  **Name**: Enter a name for the service. For example, _sample_service_.
          *  **Description (Optional)**
          *  **Tag (Optional)** 
           
    * **Create or select an Environment**: Do one of the following:
     
       * If the environment that you want to monitor exists, select it.
       * If you want to create an environment, select **+ Add New**, enter the following information, and then select **Save**. 
       
          *  **Name**: Enter a name for the environment.
          *  **Description (Optional)**
          *  **Tag (Optional)** 
          *  **Environment Type**: Select an environment type. The available options are **Production** and **Non-Production**.

    Harness autopopulates the **Monitored Service Name** field by combining the service and environment names. This field is not editable.


### Add a change source

A change source monitors change events related to deployments, infrastructure changes, and incidents.  

In the **Change Sources** section, you can either edit an existing change source or create a new one.
 
To create a new change source, do the following:

1. Select **+ Add New Change Source**.  
   The Add New Change Source dialog appears.

   ![Add new change source](./static/change-impact-moniterdservice-add-changesource.png)  

2. In the **Provider Type** dropdown list, select the change source. Following are the available options:  

    - **Deployments**: You can choose **Harness CD NextGen** or **Harness CD**. 
    - **Incident**: Select the incident management tool that monitors your application.

3. In the **Source Name** field, enter a name for the change source.
4. In the **Application** dropdown list, select an application ID. This field is available if you select Harness CD in **Provider Type**.

The new change source appears in the **Change Sources** list.


### Add a health source

A health source monitors the health trends of the monitored service using logs or metrics collected from an Application Performance Monitoring (APM)or logging tool.

To add a new health source, do the following:  

1. Select **+ Add New Health Source**.  
   The Add New Health Source dialog appears.

   ![Add new health source](./static/change-impact-moniterdservice-add-healthsource.png)

2. In the **Select health source type** section, select the health source that monitors your service.
   
3. In the **Health Source Name** field, enter a name for the health source.
   
4. In the **Connect Health Source** section, do the following:
   1. **Select Connector**: Select a existing connector. Connectors contain the information that is necessary to integrate and work with your health source.
   2. **Select Feature**: Select the feature associated with the health source. The available features depend on the health source that you select. For example, if you select **SumoLogic**, the **SumoLogic Cloud Metrics** and **SumoLogic Cloud Logs** features become available. 

5. Select **Next**.
   
6. On the **Customize Health Source** tab, configure the health source settings. The settings that are displayed depend on the health source that you select in the **Define Health Source** tab.
   
   For example, if you select AppDynamics as the **Health Source Type**, then the following settings are displayed:

   - **Find an AppDynamics application**: Displays a list of applications associated with AppDynamics. Select the application you want.
   
   - **Find an AppDynamics tier**: Displays a list of tiers associated with the selected application. Select the application tier you want.
   
   - In the **Metrics Packs** section, select the metrics that you want to use for the health source. The options available are **Errors** and **Performance**.

    ![Health source metric settings](./static/change-impact-view-healthsource-config-metric.png)
   
7. Select **Submit**.  
   The new health source appears in the **Health Sources** list.
   
8.  In the upper-right corner select **Save**.  
    You can view the new monitored service in the **Monitored Services** list.

## Next steps

Use the [Service Health dashboard](change-impact-analysis-service-health-dashboard.md) and [Changes dashboard](change-impact-analysis-changes-dash-board.md) to correlate change events and understand their impact on the monitored service.
