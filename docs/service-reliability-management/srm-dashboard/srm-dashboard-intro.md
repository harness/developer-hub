Harness Service Reliability Management (SRM) features pre-configured dashboards that offer consolidated insights into the health and historical performance of your Service Level Objectives (SLOs). These dashboards encompass data from all projects and environments within your organization.

Harness dashboards provide you with the ability to:

- Tailor, personalize, and even craft your own dashboards to suit your specific needs.
	
- Set up automated delivery schedules and configure alert notifications based on the dashboard data.
