You can configure PagerDuty as a change source for a monitored service. 


## Add PagerDuty connector to Harness

To add a PagerDuty connector:

1. In your Harness project, navigate to **Projects** > **Connectors** > **+ New Connector**.

2. On the Connectors page, under **Monitoring and Logging Systems**, select **PagerDuty**.

3. On the Overview page, enter a name for the connector, an optional description, and optional tags, and then select **Continue** to go to the Credentials page.

4. Create or select a secret to authenticate Harness with PagerDuty, and select **Next** to go to the Delegates Setup page.

5. Choose one of the following delegate setup options:

   - **Use any available Delegate**: Allows Harness to automatically select a delegate at runtime.

    - **Only use delegates with all of the following tags**: This lets you specify the tags of specific delegates that you want to use. Add the specific delegate by selecting the tags from the dropdown list or entering the delegate tag manually.

7. Select **Save and Continue**. Harness verifies the connection to PagerDuty using the secret you provided.

8. Select **Finish**. The connector gets added to the Project Connects list.
