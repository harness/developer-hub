The following general policies apply to all Harness Technical Certification exams, regardless of level or product area:

- All exams are **non-proctored** and **open book**.
- Candidates are expected to take exams independently and without assistance from others.
- Sharing, copying, or reproducing exam content in any form is strictly prohibited.

Earning a Harness certification means more than passing an exam—it reflects a commitment to excellence and integrity. As a candidate, you agree to:

- Take exams honestly, without unauthorized help or impersonation.

- Avoid disclosing exam content or facilitating violations by others.

- Sharing exam questions or answers with others.

Harness strives to ensure all certification exams are fair, objective, and inclusive. Our exam development processes are:

## Exam gets "Stuck"

### What should I do if my exam gets stuck on the "loading" screen?

If you encounter a "loading..." message followed by an error that says "There was a problem. Please try again later", your exam has gotten "stuck".

#### How do I fix this?
Please email our certification team at [certifications@harness.io](mailto:certifications@harness.io) to resolve the issue. 

#### What if I used a coupon code?
If you initially used a coupon code during your registration, you will need to re-enter it once the error is cleared.

---

## Trouble with the Hands-On Exam

### I can't load/open the Hands-On portion of the exam, what should I do?

This usually occurs because right-click is not enabled on the exam. You can manually copy and paste the URL into a new tab to access the Hands-On portion. You can use `Command+C/Command+V` for Mac or `Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V` for Windows.

---

## Running Out of Time in Hands-On Exam

### What should I do if I'm running out of time or need to step away from the Hands-On exam?

Two options are available:

1. **Are You Still There?**: If you've been idle, an "Are you still there?" pop-up will appear. Click on the "I'm still here" button to restart the timer.
