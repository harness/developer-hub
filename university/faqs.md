## Exam gets "Stuck"

### What should I do if my exam gets stuck on the "loading" screen?

If you encounter a "loading..." message followed by an error that says "There was a problem. Please try again later", your exam has gotten "stuck".

#### How do I fix this?
Please email our certification team at [certifications@harness.io](mailto:certifications@harness.io) to resolve the issue. 

#### What if I used a coupon code?
If you initially used a coupon code during your registration, you will need to re-enter it once the error is cleared.

## Trouble with the Hands-On Exam

### I can't load/open the Hands-On portion of the exam, what should I do?

This usually occurs because right-click is not enabled on the exam. You can manually copy and paste the URL into a new tab to access the Hands-On portion. You can use `Command+C/Command+V` for Mac or `Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V` for Windows.

## Running Out of Time in Hands-On Exam

### What should I do if I'm running out of time or need to step away from the Hands-On exam?

Two options are available:

1. **Are You Still There?**: If you've been idle, an "Are you still there?" pop-up will appear. Click on the "I'm still here" button to restart the timer.

Instructor-Led Trainings [e.g ILTs] are available in the following formats:
* Dedicated. Either virtual or on-site.

To ensure a productive and engaging learning environment, we require a minimum number of students to enroll in each shared vILT course. If the minimum enrollment is not met, the following steps will be taken:

* Notification of Cancellation: Registered participants will receive a notification if the course is canceled due to insufficient enrollment.
* Alternative Session Registration: Participants will be provided with options to register for another session that meets the minimum enrollment criteria.
* Notification of Cancellation: If a course does not meet the minimum enrollment requirement you will be notified via email at least 5 business days before the scheduled start date of the course and the notification will include instructions on how to register for an alternative session.

### vILT Rescheduling Options
In the event of a course cancellation:
* Alternative Sessions: You will have the option to register for any upcoming session of the same course- you can view the available sessions [here](https://university-registration.harness.io/calendar).
* Priority Enrollment: Participants from a canceled session will receive priority enrollment for rescheduled sessions.
  
### What is the cost for ILT
Instructor-Led Training has tiers of costs depending on format. All ILTs has access to the 
[Platform Pre-Req Course](https://university-registration.harness.io/introduction-to-the-harness-platform). 

* Dedicated: $12,000 for up to 12 students virtually. On-site will be the $12,000 + travel.
