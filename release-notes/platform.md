## Previous releases

<details>
<summary>2023 releases</summary>

#### June 28, 2023, version 79714

##### Platform new features

- There is now a limit of 100 API Tokens per free and community account. (PL-39337)

- When configuring SMTP, you can now select specific delegates in **Delegates Setup**. (PL-39288)

##### Early access

This release does not include any early access features.

##### Platform fixed issues

- SAML provider **Name** and **Friendly Name** fields allowed special characters. (PL-39070)

    This issue is fixed by `displayName` and `logoutURL` field validations. The `displayName` only allows alphanumeric characters, `_`, `-`, `.`, and spaces. The `logoutURL` must be a valid HTTPS URL format. 

- When creating a service account with the same name in a different scope, an error was thrown. (PL-38885)

  A code enhancement has fixed this issue.

- When **ALL** scope was selected on the **Role binding** page for a specific user, incorrect data was displayed. (PL-38426, ZD-43503)

  A code enhancement has fixed this issue.

- Deletion of vault connectors does not delete the corresponding perpetual tasks. (PL-27621)
  
  A code enhancement has fixed this issue.

- Account-level connectors with resource groups set to **Specified** were not available at the project-level. (PL-38828)

   This issue is fixed with a code enhancement. The connectors list now shows the connectors for which users have resource group permissions set.

   This item requires Harness Delegate version 79707. For information about features that require a specific delegate version, go to the [Delegate release notes](/release-notes/delegate).

- The account-level **Session Timeout (in minutes)** allowed values greater than the 4320 minute maximum. (PL-32498)

   This issue has been resolved by adding a code validation. The field no longer accepts values above 4320 minutes.

   This item requires Harness Delegate version 79707. For information about features that require a specific delegate version, go to the [Delegate release notes](/release-notes/delegate).

#### June 19, 2023, version 79606

##### Platform new features

- In earlier releases, users were allowed to include the following special characters in the user name field in their profile: colon (`:`), slash (`/`), less than sign (`<`), greater than sign (`>`), equal sign (`=`), and parentheses (`(` and `)`). Support for these special characters allowed malicious users to inject HTML and JavaScript code into deployment-related emails such as approval emails. (PL-39099)

  For enhanced security, Harness no longer allows a user to include these special characters in their name. If an existing user name has any of these special characters, Harness does not include the special characters when adding the name to emails.

- Free and Community accounts are now limited to 100 connectors. (PL-32654)

- The dialog for adding an encrypted text secret now includes an option to test a referenced secret. (PL-31083)

  This release adds a menu that you can use to sort the listed connectors in various ways (for example, by name or by date).

- In earlier releases, you could change the Git branch only in Pipeline Studio. (CDS-68007)

  Starting with this release, you can also change the branch in the dialog for running a pipeline. You can also run the pipeline from any branch directly from the pipeline listing page. 

##### Early access

This release does not include any early access features.

##### Platform fixed issues

- Certain users see the following message when they select the Connectors page for their project: "You are not authorized to view default settings.
You are missing the following permission: "View default settings" in Account scope." (PL-39221, ZD-45360)

  This issue has been fixed by the removal of an account-level permission check that has been deemed unnecessary.

- SCIM PATCH requests for deleting a Harness user return a “user does not exist” message in a successful delete operation. (PL-38868, ZD-44150)

  This issue has been resolved by returning a NULL response in the Patch operation to delete a user.

- In earlier releases, the button for managing role bindings for users, user groups, and service accounts was named +Role. However, given that you can also remove role bindings in the Manage Role Bindings dialog, the button has been renamed to Manage Roles. (PL-28484)

- Improved randomness when there are multiple eligible delegates with no tasks running to avoid selecting the same delegate each time. (PL-39219)

  This item is available with Harness Platform version 79503 and does not require a new delegate version. For information about Harness Delegate features that require a specific delegate version, go to the [Delegate release notes](/release-notes/delegate).

- The entities reference page has been improved to provide detailed information about each reference. (PL-31247)

  The following details were added to the existing reference pages:

  - Date or timestamp 
  - Name and type of entity
  - Scope of reference

  These enhancements provide comprehensive information about each reference.

- Sorting functionality is available on the project listing page and the project selector dropdown. (PL-27493)
  With this enhancement, you can easily sort and find projects you need and organize them according to your preferences.

- You can now change stages without losing the values you enter in the **Run Pipeline** form. (PIE-4663)

##### Early access

This release does not include any early access feature.

##### Fixed issues

-  HTML injection occurs due to a lack of server-side validation. (PLG-657)
  
   Server-side validation now occurs.

  An enhancement to the error-handling system enables an error message to appear when the connector API fails.

- The warning corresponding to permissions does not display properly in organization settings. (PL-31278)

  An enhancement to the width of the warning fixed the issue.

- Removing the default value from a variable in a service results in the addition of `.nan` as the default value in the YAML. (PIE-8129)
  
  In the absence of a value, the default value is now removed from the YAML.

#### February 15, 2023, version 78421

##### What's new

- The Redisson client library has been upgraded to version 3.17.7 across all services for enhanced performance and bug resolution. (PL-31136)
  This update will not affect any business operations.

- The [Role Assignment](https://apidocs.harness.io/tag/Role-Assignments/#operation/getFilteredRoleAssignmentByScopeList) API now includes the principal's name and email address in the response.(PL-31064, ZD-36050)

- Harness now supports the integration of GCP Secrets Manager for all users. (PL-31051)
  
  For more information, see [Add a Google Cloud Secret Manager](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/Security/add-a-google-cloud-secret-manager)

- There is a limit on the number of entities that can be created for **FREE** and **COMMUNITY** users in Harness. (PL-30838)
  
  Following are the entity creation limits: 

  - Project - 100
  - Secrets - 100
  - Variables - 100
  - User groups -100
  - Service accounts - 100

- You can now add policy sets under the **Advanced** section of each step. (PIE-7794)

  In this way, you can validate step outputs generated during pipeline execution without explicitly requesting a payload. Policy sets receive the steps and their outputs as payloads, with a pre-defined schema for every step.

- Accessing the CD module redirects you to one of the following: 

  - Get Started: If you don't have any pipelines in your project.

  - Deployment list page: This is the default selection page. (PIE-7625)

##### Early access

No early access features are available in this release.


##### Fixed issues

- The **Remove** option is disabled for the first user added to a user group through SCIM. A code check prevents the deletion of a user from a user group if the user is externally managed. (PL-31125, ZD-39358)

  ![](./static/remove-scim-user-issue.png)

  This issue has now been resolved and users can now remove any user from a user group created through the Harness UI.

- Deletion of externally managed users from organizations and projects is disabled. (PL-31104, ZD-39109,39110)

- Capitalization of user emails in SCIM impacts SAML authentication. (PL-31038)
  
  A code enhancement has fixed this issue.

- When trying to delete or update an externally managed user group in Harness, the error message is unclear. (PL-30641)
  
  It has been enhanced to "User is externally managed by your Identity Provider and cannot be deleted via UI / API. To delete the user from Harness, delete it from your Identity Provider."

- The default secret manager does not appear in the **Secrets Manager** list when there are more than 100 secret managers.(PL-29635)
  
  A code enhancement has fixed this issue. The default secret manager is now displayed if you enter its name in the **Secrets Manager** field.

- Deletion of vault connectors does not delete the corresponding perpetual tasks. (PL-27621)
  
  A code enhancement has fixed this issue.

- When using Firefox, the YAML Difference is not displayed in the audit trail summary. (PL-25659)

  ![](./static/audittrail-chrome-issue.png)

  A change in the configuration to load the web workers fixed this issue.

- When the pipeline is not saved in the default branch in Git, the retry pipeline does not work. (PIE-8132)
  
  A code enhancement has fixed this issue.

- In pipeline execution, the YAML builder does not support read-only operations and throws an error. (PIE-8040)
  
  A code enhancement has fixed this issue.

- The pipeline execution details page does not have a **View Compiled YAML** option.(PIE-7967)
  
  This option is now available on the execution page.

- Creating an input set results in an error. (PIE-7849, ZD-39180,39240,39250)
  
  ![](./static/inputset-create-error.png)

  A code enhancement has fixed this issue.



#### February 6, 2023, version 78321

##### What's new

- The pages in app.harness.io autofocus the search input box by default. (PL-30656)
  
  This results in a seamless search experience.

- Entities in Harness can now have `/` for the Name. (PL-29929)

- [Looping strategies](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/pipelines/looping-strategies-matrix-repeat-and-parallelism/), including matrix and parallelism strategies, are no longer behind a feature flag. (PIE-5010)

##### Early access

- You can delete a user provisioned in Harness through SCIM in NextGen and retain the user in FirstGen by enabling the feature flag `PL_USER_DELETION_V2`. (PL-23577)

##### Fixed issues

- In the SCIM API, the Groups endpoint returns all the user groups associated with an account. The ResourceTypes endpoint also returns incorrect information. (PL-30862)

  A code enhancement has fixed this issue. The Groups endpoint returns only externally managed user groups and the ResourceTypes endpoint returns details   as per the schema.

- The user group details page in the project and org scope does not display correctly when opened using the **Open in new tab** option. (PL-30911)
  
  An enhancement to the code has fixed this issue.

- The email update for SCIM users does not work. (PL-30439)
  
  A code enhancement to support user metadata updates has fixed this issue.
  
- Force deletion of a secret used for the creation of a secrets manager throws an incorrect error. (PL-29983)

  This has been fixed by displaying the appropriate error message.

- Pipelines with input sets and triggers chained together do not display input set fields correctly. (PIE-7681)
  
  An enhancement to the code has fixed this issue.

- If an execution has a matrix strategy, the text on the pipeline execution page overlaps. (PIE-7429)
  
  An adjustment to the height of the matrix wrapper has fixed this issue.

- API PUT operations for Bitbucket SaaS and on-prem connectors return an incorrect status code when there are no changes. (PIE-6230)
  
  A modification to the error message to display an appropriate explanation of the error has fixed this issue.

- The Harness APIs return a status code of HTTP 400 instead of HTTP 401 for an invalid or expired token. (PL-30757, ZD-38494,38547)

  An enhancement to the code has fixed this issue.
  
- The project selector component selects multiple projects with the same project name across different organization IDs.(PL-30663)
  
  The project selection code has been enhanced to select projects corresponding to specific organization IDs.

- The error message displayed when creating the GitHub connector and selecting **Harness Platform** as the connectivity option is not clear and informative. (PL-29953)
  
  Modifying the error message to indicate that the secret manager being used is not Harness' built-in secret manager fixed the problem.

#### January 10, 2023, version 78105

Delegate version: 78100

##### Important announcements

**Update repository references to the NextGen Helm delegate** 

The location of the repository that contains the NextGen Helm chart is changing. Change your references to the repository location from [https://app.harness.io/storage/harness-download/delegate-helm-chart/](https://app.harness.io/storage/harness-download/delegate-helm-chart/) to [https://app.harness.io/storage/harness-download/harness-helm-charts/](https://app.harness.io/storage/harness-download/harness-helm-charts/). Updates to the chart will not be made to the deprecated repository.

**The following role-assignments are removed for all the existing users across all the accounts:**(PL-28848)

  - **Account Viewer - All Account Level Resources**: This was a role-assignment within the account scope and has been removed for all the users.
  This does not apply in the following scenarios: 
    - If an account has enabled the feature flag `ACCOUNT_BASIC_ROLE_ONLY`.
    - If an account does not have the **Account Viewer - All Account Level Resources** role-assignment for the default user group `All Account Users`.
- **Organization Viewer - All Organization Level Resources**: This was a role-assignment within the organization scope and has been removed for all the users.
- **Project Viewer - All Project Level Resources**: This was a role-assignment within the project scope and has been removed for all the users.

For more information, see [Default User Group](/docs/platform/User-Management/harness-default-user-groups)


##### What's new

- Secrets and connectors now have a character limit of 128 for the **Name** and **ID** fields. (PL-29887)
  
- The [Role-Assignments](https://apidocs.harness.io/tag/Role-Assignments/#operation/getFilteredRoleAssignmentByScopeList) API now fetches role assignments by scope. 
(PL-29496, ZD-36050)
  This helps you keep a track of the role assignments within a specific scope.

- The repository location of the Helm chart for the NextGen delegate is changing. (DEL-5576) 

  The repository is being deprecated. Updates to the chart will not be made to [https://app.harness.io/storage/harness-download/delegate-helm-chart/](https://app.harness.io/storage/harness-download/delegate-helm-chart/) and will not be available from that location. To ensure retrieval of the most recent Helm chart, update your repository references to [https://app.harness.io/storage/harness-download/harness-helm-charts/](https://app.harness.io/storage/harness-download/harness-helm-charts/).

##### Early access

No early access features are available in this release.

##### Fixed issues
- Inline selection does not display connectors and secrets according to their scope. (PL-30655)
  
  An enhancement in the pre-select logic has fixed this issue.

- In spite of selecting **Start TLS** in the UI, the SMTP configuration does not support StartTLS. (PL-30574)

  A code enhancement has resolved this issue.

- The Get Resource Group API returns an HTTP 200 response code when an entity is missing. (PL-30236)

  This has been fixed, and the API now returns an HTTP 404 response code if an entity is missing.

- Editing a connector through connector selection does not automatically select it. (PL-28175)

  Enhancing the connector selection component logic to pre-select the connector in the list if it is in edit mode fixed this issue.

- Unauthorized user login to a Harness account displays a white label error. This happens when the account has SAML enabled with restricted email domain access.(PL-15022)
  
  This has been fixed by displaying appropriate error message.

- The date format in Pipeline Studio is incorrect. (PIE-7040)

  Changing the date format to `DD/MM/YYYY` has fixed this issue.

- Input sets with expression set fields does not support autocomplete. (PIE-6990)

  The addition of pipeline variables context provider to the input set form has fixed this issue.

- A hover over the stage does not display the condition details for skipping the stage. (PIE-6987)

  A correction to the path used to collect the details has fixed this issue.
  
  -   Changed how the NextGen Docker delegate is identified in the delegate section log. The Docker delegate is now identified by the delegate ID, which is the concatenation of `delegateName` and `delegateHostName`. This replaces the use of the delegate name (`delegateHostName`), which was usually the `containerId` value. (DEL-5280) 

- Changed the behavior of the delegate dropdown menu. The UI core library was updated to add a parameter that prevents the reset of expanded states when new data loads in a table. This resolved an issue with the dropdown menu collapsing automatically. (DEL-5541)

- Fixed a problem that was causing the `kryo` component to fail. The problem was caused when nested `java.lang.RuntimeException` errors occurred during manager response. (DEL-5609)

<summary>2022 releases</summary>

#### December 22, 2022, version 77908

Delegate version: 77802

##### What's new

-   API support for discovery of SCIM service provider features and schema. (PL-29069)
    
    Harness now supports the following three HTTP GET API endpoints to facilitate the discovery of SCIM service provider features and schema. These endpoints are defined in SCIM 2.0:

    -   ServiceProviderConfig

    -   ResourceType

    -   Schemas

##### Early access

No early access features are available in this release.

##### Fixed issues

-   Changed how the delegate handles secrets. Multiline secrets are now detected and masked appropriately. (DEL-5510)
 
-   Changed the display of delegate version information in Harness Manager to exclude minimum version information for delegates that are not connected. (DEL-5523)

-   The Create Resource Group API returns an HTTP 500 response code when the included scopes are blank. (PL-30195, ZD-37663)

    This has been fixed by adding a null check and throwing a null pointer exception when the included scopes are left blank.

-   Editing a connector through connector selection does not automatically select it. (PL-28175)

    Enhancing the connector selection component logic to pre-select the connector in the list if it is in edit mode fixed this issue.
    
-   Entering an invalid value for `tenant_id` does not throw any error and allows selection of previously loaded vaults in Azure Key Vault secret manager. (PL-28136)
    
    Displaying an appropriate error message and setting the vault value to empty when there is an error in fetching vaults has fixed this issue.

-   Searching for email addresses to add users to user groups does not show any results. (PL-27797)
    
    Changing the filter logic to search using the email address as well as the user name has fixed this issue.

-   The date format in Pipeline Studio is incorrect. (PIE-7040)

    Changing the date format to `DD/MM/YYYY` has fixed this issue.

-   Retrying a failed pipeline does not populate the start pipeline dialog with the input values from the previous execution. (PIE-6780, ZD-37648)
    
    Resetting the input set form with values from Formik has fixed this issue.

-   If the environment details are blank in the deploy stage settings, clicking the Service tab throws an error. (PIE-6240)
    
    Adding backward compatibility for the tabs has fixed this issue.


#### December 13, 2022, version 77808

##### What's new

- You can now refer to existing secrets of Azure Key Vault, AWS secret manager, and GCP secret manager. (PL-29915)

  With this enhancement, you need not create secrets in Harness. You can use expressions to reference the secrets already existing in the mentioned secrets managers. For more information, see [Reference Existing Secret Managers Secrets](https://developer.harness.io/docs/first-gen/firstgen-platform/security/secrets-management/reference-existing-secrets/).

- You can now use the Git client to commit changes while creating or updating pipelines using Bitbucket on-prem as the Git provider. (PIE-6423)

  To do this, enable Use Git client for commits in the default settings at the account scope. Harness checks out the code on the delegate and uses the Git client to make the commits to your Git repository.

##### Early access

No early access features are available in this release.

##### Fixed issues

- Executing a pipeline with multiple states causes issues and results in incomplete execution. (PIE-6893)

  This happens when one of the steps of the pipeline deploys a single service to multiple environments with GitOps.

  An enhancement in the logic has fixed this issue and the pipeline now executes completely.

- When running a preflight check with an empty field in input sets, the error message displays incorrectly. (PIE-5788)

  A correction to the error message has fixed this issue.

#### December 7, 2022, version 77716

Delegate: 77800

##### What's new

- Securing data through JSON Web Token (JWT) masking. (PL-29019, ZD-32004)

  Harness now masks all JWTs in pipelines and delegate logs. This change prevents data leakage risks for the applications running in Harness.

##### Early access

No early access features are available in this release.

##### Fixed issues

- Provisioning users through SCIM using Okta throws an error. This happens when a user is first staged in Okta and then activated with the Harness app. The GET API for SCIM does not return any result although the user exists in the Harness database. (PL-29702, ZD-36753)

  An enhancement in the fetch logic for the GET API has fixed this issue.

- The DELETE API for Harness entities does not throw an error when the entity identifier is invalid. The API response code is 200 and the data field in the response is False. (PL-27270)

  The API now returns an HTTP 404 response code and an appropriate error message.

- The drag-drop feature for nodes on the create node settings does not work. (PIE-6575)

  Adding event logic for improved handling of drag-and-drop actions on nodes has fixed the issue. You can now drag-drop a node on a new as well as existing node.

- The authorization header in the log streaming request is missing Bearer before the token. This issue causes log streaming to fail. (PIE-6554)

  Changing the signature of the authorization header to Authorization: Bearer `<token>` has fixed this issue.

- Clicking All Events when creating a notification for a pipeline does not select all the events. (PIE-6524)

  Selecting all the pipeline events on clicking All Events has fixed this issue. Now the All Events field also has an additional state indeterminate associated with it. The state indicates if all the pipeline events are neither included nor excluded for notifications.

- The HTML parsing for pipeline logs takes longer than expected and delays the display of the logs. (PIE-6538)

  An enhancement in the parsing technique and the introduction of caching has fixed this issue.

- When creating a pipeline, stage, or step, you are allowed to use the $ sign in the name or identifier even though the $ sign is invalid in those strings. (PIE-6078)

  A modification to the regex to remove the support for the $ sign has fixed this issue.

#### November 29, 2022, version 77608

Delegate: 77431

##### What's new

**Platform**

- Fix to help you identify Harness in your two-factor authentication app. (PL-29563)

  The default name of the entry for Harness in two-factor authentication (2FA) apps such as Google Authenticator now begins with Harness\_. This change enables you to identify the correct entry, and to therefore use the correct code, for authenticating to Harness. If you configured 2FA for Harness before this change, remove the existing entry and reconfigure 2FA to see the new name.

- Direct use of email addresses in v2 APIs for creating and updating user groups. (PL-29018)

  You can now use email addresses in v2 APIs for creating or updating a user group. It is no longer required to first fetch the email addresses by using user IDs

- You can now create user groups inline when setting up the Approval stage in a pipeline. (PL-28022)

  This is helpful when the user group that needs to be sent notifications does not already exist. The scope of the user group is within the project corresponding to the pipeline.

- The Harness UI now lists the versions of services in your account settings. To see the versions, go to Account Settings > Overview, and then expand Platform Service Versions. (PL-26581)

  Approval messages in Harness approvals can now have expressions in multiple lines. (PIE-6238, ZD-36667,37069)

- Harness service variables now support dots (.). (PIE-4613)

  This is helpful when you have JSON/YAML files where you want to update the keys with some values. You can define variables for those keys in harness with (.) to access the keys. The expression to access a key would be:
  <+variables.get("example.key")>

- You can now drag the step details section and move it to the desired location. (PIE-3890)

- You need not enter the Tags or Description while importing an entity from Git. (PIE-6171)

  The corresponding information for these fields are fetched from Git.

##### Fixed issues

**Platform**

- Adopted the use of an immutable image for the delegate that is installed by default in newly created accounts. For more information on new delegate features including auto-update, see Delegate
  Overview. (DEL-4888)

- When provisioning users through SCIM, users receive two emails: one from FirstGen and the other from NextGen. (PL-29896)

  This happens when the account has two-factor authentication enabled and the authentication mechanism is SAML with SCIM. This has now been fixed to send a single email to the provisioned users.

- Referencing multiple secrets by using the dynamic secret expression for HashiCorp Vault causes issues. The value of the latest decrypted secret replaces the values of any previously decrypted secret. (PL-29554, ZD-36459)

  This has now been fixed and the secrets have the corresponding decrypted values.

- The list of environment groups does not appear in the runtime input settings. (PIE-6411)

  This has now been fixed and the list of environment groups is available in the runtime input settings.

- When the length of a variable expression is more than 2048 characters in a pipeline, saving the pipeline takes longer than expected. (PIE-6291, ZD-36820)

  Simplifying the regex for the variable value expressions has now fixed this.

- Clicking Run in pipeline studio navigates to the input sets section in Run Pipeline window. This happens even when you have no runtime inputs for a Pipeline.(PIE-6264).

  This has now been fixed. If a pipeline does not need any runtime inputs, clicking on Run starts the pipeline execution.

- Service V2 does not resolve the infrastructure definition parameters passed from the triggers. (PIE-6155, ZD-36720)

  When a trigger invokes a pipeline, the YAML definition of the trigger and the corresponding pipeline with runtime inputs are merged. In YAML files with a single node element, the infrastructure definition is not processed on the triggers and is not passed as a runtime value.

  This has now been fixed. The YAML processing on triggers now takes care of processing the single node elements and propagates the value to the respective pipeline.

- The frequency of polling to fetch the pipeline execution list is 20 seconds. Such a long polling interval means that the data fetched by one poll goes stale before the next poll. (PIE-6151)

  This has now been fixed by increasing the polling frequency to every 5 seconds.

- The Save as New Input Set settings does not close after you save the details. (PIE-5708)

  This issue occurs when you run a pipeline that requires runtime input sets. This has now been fixed and the Save as New Input Set settings close after you save the details.

- Selecting an event as Merge Request, the default selection for Build Type is not correct for GitLab webhook triggers.(PIE-5117)
  This has now been fixed by changing the default selection for Build Type to Git Pull Request for the Merge Request event.

#### November 11, 2022, version 77433

Delegate version: 77431

##### What's new

**Platform**

- You can now send email notifications to all the members of a user group by selecting the Send email to all users part of the user group option.(PL-29434, ZD-32444)

  For existing user groups, this is the default option.

- The organization filter selection on the project listing page will now persist across user sessions and page navigations.(PL-29292)
  You can now see the versions of the services in Account Overview in Platform Service Versions.(PL-26581)

##### Early access

- You can now create secrets using the Google Cloud Secret Manager in Harness. (PL-28978)

  For more information, see [Add a Google Cloud Secret Manager](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/security/add-a-google-cloud-secret-manager/).

- You can now select modules and configure your own navigation in Harness. (SPG-153)

  Also, Projects is a new option in the left navigation. Click Projects to view the project-specific overview, pipeline, connector, and other details.

##### Fixed issues

**Custom Dashboards**

- A bug causing some Dashboards to be displayed incorrectly based on their Feature Flags has been fixed. Dashboards are now correctly shown or hidden by their corresponding Feature Flags. (CDB-390)

- Users previously were able to only clone Dashboards either from the "Out Of The Box" Dashboards, or from folders where they had an EDIT permission assigned. Now, if the user has any folder in which they have the EDIT permission assigned, they can clone any available Dashboard into that folder. (CDB-415)

Dashboard alerts and schedules will now run at the specified time in the users local timezone. (CDB-434)

**Platform**

- Fixed critical vulnerability CVE-2022-42889 in the delegate image.

- Introduced vertical scaling capabilities for non-legacy delegates. The Xmx flag that specifies the maximum memory allocation for the Java process is set to 70% of the container allotment. (DEL-5150)

- Enhanced the information on delegate creation and listing in the delegate installation pages. (DEL-5098)

- When clicking Save in the Default settings, error messages do not appear for the radio buttons and checkboxes. (PL-29489)

  Introducing formik fields and external error message components for the non-formik fields has fixed this issue.

- Harness Audit Logs API is returning an incorrect error for an expired token. (PL-29425, ZD-36045)

  The API response now returns the correct error when the API token is invalid or expired.

- User Invite Auto Accept is not working when Oauth is enabled and the feature flag AUTO_ACCEPT_SAML_ACCOUNT_INVITES is enabled. (PL-28807)

  Removing the SAML condition for Auto Invite Accept has fixed this issue.

- Re-run Pipeline is not working as expected. (PIE-6134)

  This issue has now been fixed by checking if the values of the variables are missing from the variables map.

- When running the pipeline, the primary artifact source is not auto-selected and tags and buckets are not fetched. (PIE-6084)

  This issue has now been fixed.

- When clicking outside the step settings, there is no option to Apply Changes or Cancel. (PIE-4428)

  This issue has now been fixed.

#### November 6, 2022, version 77317

##### What's new

**Platform**

The option to disable Harness Secret Manager is now a part of the core settings in Account Default Settings. (PL-27160)

##### Early access

**Platform**

You can now get optimized performance on remote pipelines if you are on delegate version 772xx or higher,
by enabling the feature flag USE_GET_FILE_V2_GIT_CALL . (PL-29459)

If you are on an older delegate version, you can upgrade your delegate and then enable the feature flag for optimized performance.

##### Fixed issues

**Platform**

- The scope of a newly created connector in the account scope was incorrect. When a user tried to use a connector in the account scope, the project scope was displayed. (PL-29190)

  This has now been fixed to pick the scope information from the connector data.

- On clicking Import Template in Templates, the title of the settings was Import Templates from Git. (PL-29094)

  The title of the settings is now Import Template from Git.

- Users were receiving two 2FA emails when the feature flags AUTO_ACCEPT_SAML_ACCOUNT_INVITES and PL_NO_EMAIL_FOR_SAML_ACCOUNT_INVITES were enabled. (PL-29081)

  This has now been fixed to restrict notifications with 2FA QR code emails to just one.

- Editing secrets in Azure Key Vault with minimum permissions was failing. (PL-29025)

- The Default Settings in the project scope displayed side navigation options for the account scope. (PL-28977)

  Harness now displays the scope-specific side navigation options while on the Default Settings.

- Audit logs were not generated when the authentication mechanism was changed. (PL-28680)

  No audit logs were available when the authentication mechanism was changed from:

  - SAML to LDAP and vice versa

  - User name and password to OAuth and vice versa

  This has now been fixed so that Audit logs are available for changes in the authentication mechanism.

- On creating a connector inline in the Pipeline studio, the connector was not listed in the connectors list and was not selected by default. (PL-27819)

  This has now been fixed so that the connector list refreshes and selects the inline connector by default.

- While editing a connector in the account scope, users were able to select secrets at the organization and project scope. (PL-25825)

  This has now been fixed to display secrets in the parent scope while editing a connector.

- The user was able to delete a Secret Manager in Harness after disabling the Harness Secret Manager. (PL-23148)

  Harness now checks if there is at least one active secret manager before deleting a secret manager while the Harness Secret Manager is disabled.

- On the secret details page, there was no option to delete the secret. (PL-15045)

  This has now been fixed to provide options to edit and delete a secret from the secret details page.

- In the Pipelines, when the commit message was left blank, the Pipeline Execution History threw an exception. (PIE-6017)

  This has now been fixed so that the Pipeline Execution History displays execution details.

- The Run pipeline YAML with K8s Apply step was incorrect when the input set data was undefined. (PIE-5998)

  This has now been fixed to pick the input set data from the parent component. Also, all fields path are now updated at runtime.

- In a Pipeline with input sets, the specified delegates were ignored while merging the input sets. (PIE-5879, ZD-35813)

  This has now been fixed to pick the delegates corresponding to the delegate selectors.

- In Pipeline Triggers, deleting variables from the YAML caused inconsistent behavior. (PIE-5737, ZD-35537)

  This has now been fixed to enable the deletion of variables from the YAML by fetching the base values from the Templates.

- The display of detail information for immutable delegates version 76300 and earlier was changed to indicate that autoUpgrade is OFF. These delegate versions do not include the autoUpgrade feature. (DEL-5096)

**Platform**

- No precedence was set when the auth mechanism was username and password and the feature flag PL_NO_EMAIL_FOR_SAML_ACCOUNT_INVITES was enabled. (PL-28739)

  This is now fixed by adding a check to ensure the auth mechanism of username and password takes precedence.

- Deleting a Project was not deleting the referenced secrets. (PL-28613)

  This is fixed by deleting the secrets corresponding to a deleted Project.

- The repo name was null in the file path URL for Bitbucket On-Prem account level connector. (PL-28533)

- The hard delete for environment was not working as expected. (PL-28403, ZD-34833,35135)

- The audit trail displayed for vault \_authTokenRef secrets was not correct. (PL-26764, ZD-32596)

  This is fixed by not storing any dummy secret if the feature flag DO_NOT_RENEW_APPROLE_TOKEN is enabled for the vault app role.

- User was not able to edit the barrier name in the Pipeline's flow control section. (PIE-5621)

#### October 7, 2022, version 77025

  Harness will not send any emails for user invites when the feature flag PL_NO_EMAIL_FOR_SAML_ACCOUNT_INVITES is enabled.

##### Fixed issues

**Platform**

- Introduced a new method for the Docker delegate to provide proxy configuration. This method provides additional support for scenarios in which delegates running on VMs experience difficulties referencing Kubernetes secrets. (DEL-4813)

- Changed the UI to ensure the correct API was invoked. This corrects a functional problem that involved the Add Delegates list. (DEL-4833)

- User invites were not sent for the configured SMTP. (PL-28208)

  This is now fixed by creating SMTP in Next Gen.

- Incorrect auth mechanism was displayed when switching from LDAP to username password. (PL-27887)

##### Fixed issues

**Platform**

- The INIT_SCRIPT was changed to correct an issue that changed behavior. The issue was triggered with the use of the set -e command. (DEL-4898, ZD-34654)

- The Default value column is not yet available to users, but the column was added to the user interface. (PL-28215)

  Now, the Default value column is removed from the Variables list page since you can't provide a default value.​

- The field Variable on the Accounts and Organization pages wasn't consistent with the rest of the pages. (PL-28214)​

  The issue is fixed by removing the Validation text in the Variables form and replacing it with a simple text box and a tooltip that specifies 'Only Fixed Values' are supported in Scope Variables.​

- The error message displayed by GCP KMS was generic and not useful. (PL-28103)​

  Now, the error message displays details such as the error code, reason, etc., that would aid in resolving the issue causing the error.​

- When you enter invalid credentials, the Microsoft Azure Vault client authentication exception was logged, but not considered as an error, and proceeded to the next step where the execution failed. (PL-28017)​

  Now, this issue is fixed. The exception is logged as an error and doesn't proceed further.​

  The error message displayed when a Microsoft Azure Vault encryption failed was generic and not meaningful.​

  Now, the error message displays details such as the error code, account ID, secret name, etc., that would aid in resolving the issue causing the error.​​

#### September 22, 2022, version 76817

##### What's new

**Platform**

- Harness Manager was changed to remove the edit and details UI for Immutable Delegates. These Delegates cannot be changed. (DEL-4756)

- A migration will run to remove the following Role Bindings directly assigned to users for accounts having ACCOUNT_BASIC_ROLE turned ON (PL-28284):

  - At Account Scope, Account Basic/Account Viewer -All Account Resources​.
  - At Organization scope, Organization Viewer - All Organization Resources.​
  - At Project Scope, Project Viewer - All Project Resources.​

  Harness now has a default User Group at each scope. These groups have all the users at the respective scope as their members. As a part of this change, Harness will stop assigning any roles to the User Groups by default.​ Users can assign roles to the default User Group at a specific scope, which becomes the default role for all the users in that group. (PL-26145)

  See [Harness Default User Groups](/docs/platform/User-Management/harness-default-user-groups).

- The Recently Viewed option for sorting dashboards was not functioning correctly. This has been fixed so that the most recently viewed dashboards now appear in the correct order. (CDB-314)

- When using a vanity URL, some dashboards were linking to the Harness URL instead of the vanity one. This has been fixed and your dashboards now link to your correct URL. (CDB-355)

**Platform**

- The Vault Renewal Perpetual Task corresponding to a deleted Vault Secret Manager was not getting deleted. (PL-27952)

- First Gen login Audit Events were being captured in Next Gen Audit Trail. (PL-22435, ZD-26366)

- Create via YAML Builder did not have a cancel option. (PL-20197)

- Git Management options were not displayed for Feature Flags. (PIE-5292)

  This was because it was using a Project level flag that was replaced. This is now fixed by using the replaced flag.

- The links for information on Looping Strategies was redirecting to incorrect docs. (PIE-5266, ZD-34311)

  This is fixed by updating the appropriate doc links.

**Pipelines**

- Git Management option was not available for Feature Flags. (PIE-5292)

- The link to the Looping Strategies doc was not correct. (PIE-5266, ZD-34311)

- Pipelines with multiple parallel stages were not rendered as expected. (PIE-5018, ZD-33844)

- Errors were encountered while executing a Pipeline after saving Input Sets to a new branch. (PIE-4981)
  This is fixed by by disabling the Commit to a new branch option for Input Sets.

##### Important Announcements

**Platform**

Harness now has a default User Group at each scope. These groups have all the users at the respective scope as their members.

As a part of this change, Harness will stop assigning any roles to the User Groups by default.

Users can assign roles to the default User Group at a specific scope, which becomes the default role for all the users in that group.

For more information on default User Group, see [Harness Default User Groups](/docs/platform/User-Management/harness-default-user-groups).

#### September 7, 2022, version 76619

##### What's new

- You can now inherit User Groups created at a higher scope by using Assign Roles. (PL-27237)

  See [Assign Roles](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/User-Management/add-user-groups#step-assign-roles).

##### Fixed issues

- Fixed the display of an error message in the UI. The error message was not properly displayed when a pipeline selector was added using invalid characters. (DEL-4755)

- The Description of User Groups in Access Control was not wrapped and was resulting in inconsistent UI. (PL-27733, ZD-34043)

- Error was thrown when importing a Pipeline from Git which was already in use. (PL-27598)

  This is fixed now by displaying a confirmation message.

- Pipeline was not being triggered while setting up a trigger for a Bitbucket repo. (PIE-4827, ZD-33190)

  This is fixed by fixing the order of commit hashes being passed from delegate to SCM service.

##### What's new

- Git Experience in Next Gen is now enhanced and simplified. (PL-26339)

  See [Git Experience](https://developer.harness.io/docs/category/git-experience/).

- You can now switch branches directly from the Pipeline execution history. This will make it easier to switch branches straight from execution history rather than going to the Pipeline studio first and then returning to execution history. (PIE-4985)

##### Early access

No early access features are available in this release.

##### Fixed issues

- Email notification for approval was not to SCIM groups with "\_" in the group name. (PL-26457)

- Multiple error toasts occurred when there was network failure because the error toast condition was at the component level, hence getting re-rendered every time. (PIE-5019)

- Users without appropriate permissions were able to create Pipeline and add Stage and Steps. (PIE-5008)

  The Add Stage and Add Step options are now hidden for users with View permission.

- The existing Input Sets were not getting updated. (PIE-4855)

##### Fixed issues

- Error messages were not displayed while creating a HashCorp Vault Connector. (PL-27383​)

  This was happening for App Role based login because the value of the namespace was not sent as part of the vault config.

  As a part of this fix, the namespace value is now added.

- Errors were blocking users from creating a secret even after clicking the back button and updating the correct values. (PL-26169​)

  This is now fixed by sending the updated data when the back button is clicked.

- Unsaved changes were retained even after clicking Discard in the Pipeline Studio. (PIE-4880​)

- The loading indicator was not displayed when filters were applied. (PIE-4829​)
