#### **SDK Enhancements**
##### **Split Suite, Browser SDK**
Users can now automatically capture event data in [Split for their Browser SDK](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/22622277712781-Browser-Suite) without needing additional agents, integrations, or track calls. This eliminates the manual process of sending events to Split, allowing users to quickly set up metrics and alert policies.
