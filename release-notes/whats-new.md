## March 31, 2023, version 78914

### Continuous Integration

* When you [use a GitHub App in a GitHub connector](/docs/platform/connectors/git-hub-app-support/#step-5-use-github-app-and-secret-in-harness-github-connector), you can now use encrypted text secrets for the **Installation ID** and **Application ID**. (CI-7380)
* Added a [codebase expression](/docs/continuous-integration/ci-technical-reference/built-in-cie-codebase-variables-reference) for commit messages: `<+codebase.commitMessage>`. (CI-7222)

### Harness Platform

- The favicon now dynamically changes based on pipeline execution status on the dashboard's execution view. (PL-31520)

### Continuous Delivery

- Harness supports manually adding service or environment [runtime inputs](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/references/runtime-inputs/) in the pipeline YAML. (CDS-54249)

  You can now manually add service or environment runtime input expressions in the pipeline YAML. The values added to the YAML are reflected on the Harness UI. 
  
  Here's an example of the YAML:

  ```yaml
  ...
           service:
            serviceRef: CDS54249
            serviceInputs:
              serviceDefinition:
                type: Kubernetes
                spec:
                  manifests:
                    - manifest:
                        identifier: foo
                        type: K8sManifest
                        spec:
                          store:
                            type: Github
                            spec:
                              connectorRef: <+input>
                              repoName: <+input>
                              branch: <+input>
                  artifacts:
                    primary:
                      primaryArtifactRef: <+input>
                      sources: <+input>

- The [Jira Update](https://developer.harness.io/docs/continuous-delivery/cd-advanced/ticketing-systems-category/update-jira-issues-in-cd-stages) step now supports modifying the issue type. (CDS-54027)

  When you update a Jira issue using the Jira Update step, you can now modify the issue type by selecting the desired one from the drop-down list. For example, you can change a Story issue type to a Task. 

  ![](static/jira-update-step.png)

  The Issue Key is used to automatically fetch additional (optional) fields in the Jira Update step.
  
  ![](static/add-jira-fields.png)
  
- You can now select specific services and environments at an account or organization level when creating a deployment freeze window. (CDS-54222, CDS-53783)

  When creating a deployment freeze window, select specific services and environments at an account or organization level using the **Add Rule** option in the **Coverage** tab. 

  ![](static/freeze-deployments-src-env.png)

  * At the account level freeze window, you can access account level services and environments only.
  * At the organization level freeze window, you can access account and organization level services and environments.
  * At the project level freeze window, you can access account, organization, and project level services and environments.
  
  For more information, go to [freeze deployments](https://developer.harness.io/docs/continuous-delivery/cd-deployments-category/deployment-freeze/).
- Harness recommends that you use the `kubelogin` auth plugin to authenticate the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster with Kubernetes version 1.22 or later. (CDS-52513)
  
  The open source community requires that all provider-specific codes that currently exist in the OSS codebase must be removed starting from version 1.26. You can now use client-go credential plugins to authenticate Kubernetes cluster logins. Auth Provider is deprecated for Kubernetes version 1.22 or later, and completely unsupported for versions 1.26 or later. For Harness Azure cloud providers connecting to AKS with Kubernetes version 1.22 or later, we recommend using the `kubelogin` auth plugin for authentication.

  The Harness Azure cloud provider (connecting to AKS) supports four authentication types. For each authentication type, the following dependencies must be installed on your Harness delegate. It they are missing, Harness will follow the old auth provider format.

  * `SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_SECRET`: Add `kubelogin` binary.
  * `SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_CERT`: Requires additional dependency on Azure CLI. Therefore, we use the old auth provider to authenticate AKS cloud provider. 
  * `MANAGED_IDENTITY_SYSTEM_ASSIGNED`: No need to add any dependency.
  * `MANAGED_IDENTITY_USER_ASSIGNED`: No need to add any dependency.
- A **RouteMapping** step is enabled for [Tanzu Application Services (TAS) deployments](https://developer.harness.io/docs/continuous-delivery/onboard-cd/cd-quickstarts/tanzu-app-services-quickstart) to enable map and unmap routes. (CDS-50535)

  In the **Execution** tab of the TAS pipeline, you can now add a **Route Mapping** step for any execution strategy to configure route mapping or unmapping. 

  ![](static/route-mapping-tas.png)

  The parameters of the **Route Mapping** step are: 
    * **Name** - Deployment step name. For example, Map Route or Unmap Route.
    * **Timeout** - How long you want the Harness delegate to wait for the TAS cloud to respond to API requests before timing out and initiating the failure strategy.
    * **Mapping Type** - Select **Map Route** or **UnMap Route** to map or unmap routes respectively. 
    * **App Name** - Enter the application name.
    * **Routes** - Enter the routes you want to map or unmap to this deployment. 
     
  ![](static/route-mapping.png)

- You can now see what pipelines are using an Infrastructure Definition. (CDS-46777)
  
  The **Referenced By** tab in the **Environments** page now includes the pipelines that are using the infrastructure definitions in the environment. **Referenced By** now shows all pipelines that use the environment and each infrastructure definition individually.
  
  ![](static/referenced-by-tab.png)

## March 30, 2023

### Security Testing Orchestration, version 1.40.2

* The Snyk integration has been updated. Orchestrated Snyk scans now upload results to the external Snyk portal by default. (STO-5607)

* This release includes the following enhancements to the [Jira integration](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/use-sto/jira-integrations):
   * After you create a new ticket, **Issue Details** replaces the **Create Ticket** button with a link to the new ticket and the ticket status. (STO-5518)

     Before:

     ![](./static/sto-jira-ticket-create-BEFORE.png)

     After:

     ![](./static/sto-jira-ticket-create-AFTER.png)

   * The External Tickets page now automatically populates the **Default Project Name** and **Default Project Type** menus based on the selected ticket-provider connector. (STO-5492)


## March 24, 2023, version 78817

### Continuous Integration

* [Cache Intelligence](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/caching-ci-data/cache-intelligence/) is now generally available. With Cache Intelligence, Harness automatically caches and restores common dependencies. You don't need to bring your own storage because Harness stores the cache in the Harness-hosted environment, Harness Cloud. (CI-7127)
* [Harness Cloud](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/set-up-build-infrastructure/use-harness-cloud-build-infrastructure) build infrastructure now supports **Run as User** for [Plugin](/docs/continuous-integration/ci-technical-reference/plugin-step-settings-reference) and [Run](/docs/continuous-integration/ci-technical-reference/run-step-settings) steps that are running on containers. (CI-7320)

### Service Reliability Management

- When you try editing an existing SLO, you will see the **Tags (optional)** field autopopulated even if no value was entered while creating the SLO. Harness uses the selected SLI type as value to autopopulate the **Tags (optional)** field. (SRM-14121)
  
- There is a new user interface (UI) for Elasticsearch health source configuration. This update is designed to improve the overall user experience and make it easier to configure Elasticsearch health sources. (SRM-14180)

### Harness Platform

- You can now add specific service accounts to your resource group. (PL-31867)
  
  By doing this, you can prevent accidental or deliberate misuse of API keys by restricting who can generate them from which service accounts.

- You can now enter usernames as a comma separated string while adding users in **Users(name or email)**. (PL-29630)

### Continuous Delivery

- [Azure Repo](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/connectors/connect-to-a-azure-repo/) is now supported as a manifest repo for Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) and Serverless.com Framework Lambda deployments. (CDS-54961)

  When creating Amazon ECS or Serverless.com Framework Lambda deployment pipelines, you can now use Azure Repo as a manifest repo in the service definition.
  
- Harness now supports template input APIs. (CDS-55694)
  
  You can now use the `/templateInputs/[templateIdentifier]` API to get template inputs using the `getTemplateInputSetYaml` query parameter when creating a [pipeline template](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/Templates/create-pipeline-template).
  
  Here is a sample template: 
  
  ```yaml
  template:
  name: my_template
  identifier: eqweqw
  versionLabel: v1
  type: StepGroup
  projectIdentifier: projtest
  orgIdentifier: default
  tags: {}
  spec:
    stageType: Deployment
    steps:
      - step:
          name: my_template
          identifier: my_template
          template:
            templateRef: account.same_name
            versionLabel: v1
    delegateSelectors: <+input>

- Harness supports filtering Docker artifact tags based on regex. (CDS-53644)
  
  You can now filter Docker artifact tags based on regex when using runtime inputs during pipeline execution. 

  ![](static/tag-regex.png)

- You can now provide an already created task definition ARN during ECS service configuration in Harness. (CDS-50112)
  
  The task definition ARN points to an existing task created and available in the AWS cluster with the required definition. The task definition will be fetched using the task ARN provided and added to the ECS service configuration provided in the Harness ECS service **Service Definition**.
  
  During deployment, the required task is deployed with the desired count provided in the **Service Definition**. 

  Go to [ECS deployment tutorial](https://developer.harness.io/docs/continuous-delivery/onboard-cd/cd-quickstarts/ecs-deployment-tutorial) for more information.

- You can now view the ServiceNow Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) and Jira Personal Access Token (PAT) in the **Credentials** section of the **Connectors** page. (CDS-55670)
  
  ![](static/connector-credentials.png)
  
## March 21, 2023, version 78903

### Cloud Cost Management

Enabled audit trail for budget groups. (CCM-11387)

  With this enhancement, you can track all CRUD operations such as Create, Delete, and Update related to budget groups.

* Display the AWS account ID and name on the **Recommendations** page. (CCM-11666)

  The AWS Account ID has been added to the ECS Services on the Recommendations list page.

* Cost category enhancement (CCM-10580)

  Introduced support to allocate the cost of shared cost buckets by a fixed percentage among each cost bucket. A new user interface has been developed. 
  
    ![](./static/cost-category-builder-2.png)

  
  For more information, go to [Use Cost Categories](https://developer.harness.io/docs/cloud-cost-management/use-cloud-cost-management/ccm-cost-categories/use-ccm-cost-categories).

## March 15, 2023, version 78712

### Harness Delegate

- Integrated **Logs** API in the **Executed Details** page where the delegate task ID is available. (DEL-6035)

  You can now view logs for delegate tasks for pipeline steps that are running or finished. This can help with debugging issues. 

- Set an expiry for delegate tokens. (DEL-5652)

  When you create a delegate token through APIs, you can provide an optional parameter `revokeAfter`. This is the epoch time in milliseconds after which the token is marked as revoked. There can be a delay of up to one hour from when the epoch value is provided to when the token is revoked. 

### Continuous Integration

* The [Base Image Connector setting](/docs/continuous-integration/ci-technical-reference/build-and-push-to-ecr-step-settings#base-image-connector) for the **Build and Push to ECR** step now supports all Docker-compliant registries. Previously, this setting only supported DockerHub registries. (CI-7153, CI-7091, ZD-40319)
* You can now call pipeline-level variables in steps as environment variables. This is an extension of existing functionality that allows you to call stage-level variables in steps as environment variables. (CI-6709, ZD-39203)
* When configuring [SCM connectors](/docs/category/code-repo-connectors):
  * Failed connection tests now return more detailed error messages. (CI-7089)
  * The placeholder text in the **Repository URL** field shows a complete repo URL example. (CI-5750)

### Continuous Delivery

- The [Jira Update](https://developer.harness.io/docs/continuous-delivery/cd-advanced/ticketing-systems-category/update-jira-issues-in-cd-stages) step now supports updating the issue type. (CDS-53876)

  When you update a Jira issue using the Jira Update step, you can now update the issue type. For example, if the issue you are updating is a Story, you can update it to a Task.

  To update an issue type, add a new field named `Issue Type` and mention the new type in its **Value**.

```mdx-code-block
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
```
```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="YAML" label="YAML" default>
```

```yaml
              - step:
                type: JiraUpdate
                name: Jira Update_1
                identifier: JiraUpdate_1
                spec:
                  connectorRef: fcdx
                  issueKey: <+execution.steps.JiraCreate_1.issue.key>
                  transitionTo:
                    transitionName: ""
                    status: Done
                  fields:
                    - name: Description
                      value: Improve feature X.
                    - name: Issue Type
                      value: Task
```


```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Pipeline Studio" label="Pipeline Studio">
```

  ![update issue type](static/e7593d80236125833f145babe470114b8fa5edb75633c507c20e176dd3c40ed2.png)


```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

- The **Resize Strategy** field in the **Canary App Setup** step of a [Tanzu Application Services (TAS, formerly PCF) deployment](https://developer.harness.io/docs/continuous-delivery/onboard-cd/cd-quickstarts/tanzu-app-services-quickstart) can be added as runtime input when using the canary deployment strategy. (CDS-53201)
  
  ![](static/canary-app-set-up-resize.png)

### Harness Platform

- The Harness UI now supports editing the email domain when creating a Service Account. Previously, the email domain was auto-generated and there was no option to edit it. (PL-31769)
  
- You can now migrate only the admin users of FirstGen to NextGen by enabling the feature flag `PL_DO_NOT_MIGRATE_NON_ADMIN_CG_USERS_TO_NG`. Previously, all FirstGen users were migrated to NextGen along with the admins. (PL-31648)
  
- The [List Role Assignments by scope filter](https://apidocs.harness.io/tag/Role-Assignments/#operation/getFilteredRoleAssignmentByScopeList) API now supports the following filters:

  - Principal Type Filter: Filters role assignments based on principal type.

  - Harness Managed Filter: Filters role assignments based on roles managed by Harness. For example, an Account Administrator. 

  - Disabled Filter: Filters disabled role assignments. (PL-31352)

- Filters for audit trails are now listed alphabetically. (PL-31204)

- Template expressions now support `when` conditions. (PIE-8762)

### Service Reliability Management

- Metrics graphs are now added to the **Create SLO** screen. (SRM-14025)  
    
  When configuring Service Level Indicators (SLIs) in the **Create SLO** screen, you will now see a metric graph based on the last 24 hours of data received from your health monitoring tool. Additionally, the recommended minimum, maximum, and average values specific to the SLI parameter that you are configuring will be displayed.  
  
  This feature eliminates the need for switching between the Harness **Create SLO** screen and your health monitoring tool dashboard to determine the most appropriate value for the SLI parameter you are configuring. For instance, if you opt for the ratio-based evaluation method while configuring your SLI, you can refer to the metric graphs and accompanying suggested values to determine the ideal percentage of valid requests to be considered for your SLI.

## March 14, 2023

### Security Testing Orchestration

This release includes a set of new scanner-specific steps (step palettes) for Aqua Trivy, Bandit, SonarQube, and other popular scanners. These steps greatly simplify the process of setting up scans in your pipelines. Previously, the workflow for all scanners was to enter a set of hard-coded key and value strings in a Security step. These new steps have simplified user-friendly UIs that include only the options relevant to the specific scanner, mode, and target.

The following security steps are now generally available:

* [Aqua Trivy](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/sto-techref-category/aqua-trivy-scanner-reference) (STO-5393)
* [Bandit](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/sto-techref-category/bandit-scanner-reference) (STO-5050)
* [Black Duck Hub](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/sto-techref-category/black-duck-hub-scanner-reference) (STO-5052)
* [Checkmarx](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/sto-techref-category/checkmarx-scanner-reference) (STO-5073)
* [Grype](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/sto-techref-category/grype-scanner-reference) (STO-5394)
* [Mend (formerly Whitesource)](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/sto-techref-category/mend-scanner-reference) (STO-5392)
* [Prisma Cloud (formerly Twistlock)](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/sto-techref-category/prisma-cloud-scanner-reference) (STO-5055)
* [Snyk](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/sto-techref-category/snyk-scanner-reference) (STO-5053)
* [SonarQube](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/sto-techref-category/sonarqube-sonar-scanner-reference) (STO-5051)
* [Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/sto-techref-category/zap-scanner-reference) (STO-5058)


## March 13, 2023

### Cloud Cost Management

  Cost Category enhancements (CCM-10280)
  
  - When calculating the cost for `Unattributed`, the rules present in the shared cost bucket are not considered to eliminate duplicate costs.
  - If **Cost Category** is `NOT NULL` in a perspective, it means all cost buckets are considered. `Unattributed` is not taken into account.
  - If the **Cost Category** is `NULL`, it indicates that the cost buckets are not considered in the perspective. `Unattributed` is taken into account.
  - Previously, all shared cost buckets were displayed as `No Groupby`. Now, when you apply a GroupBy option other than the cost category, the cost of the rules present in the shared cost bucket are displayed in a separate entity based on the GroupBy selection you have made. However, it is important to note that this change will be effective only if you have incorporated cost category with shared buckets in perspective rules.

## March 9, 2023

### Security Testing Orchestration

* The new [Jira integration](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/use-sto/jira-integrations) has been enhanced. If an issue has an associated Jira ticket, the Issue Details pane now shows the ticket status along with the number. (STO-5491)

## March 8, 2023, version 78619

### Continuous Delivery

- The YAML schema for the Jira connector has been migrated to a new version that encapsulates the authentication details in a new `auth` object with type `UsernamePassword`. This migration enables Harness to support different authentication types in the Jira connector. 

The first of the following two YAML snippets shows the new `auth` object and the new `username` and `passwordRef` fields nested within it. The second YAML snippet shows you the previous YAML specification for purposes of comparison.
```
connector:
  name: jira
  identifier: jira
  description: ""
  orgIdentifier: default
  projectIdentifier: <pid>
  type: Jira
  spec:
    serviceNowUrl: https://jiraUrl.atlassian.net/
    username: harnessqa
    passwordRef: HarnessQA
    auth:
      type: UsernamePassword
      spec:
        username: harnessqa
        passwordRef: HarnessQA
    delegateSelectors:
      - harnessci-platform-ng-prod
```
```
connector:
  name: jira
  identifier: jira
  description: ""
  orgIdentifier: default
  projectIdentifier: <pid>
  type: Jira
  spec:
    serviceNowUrl: https://jiraUrl.atlassian.net/
    username: harnessqa
    passwordRef: HarnessQA
    delegateSelectors:
      - harnessci-platform-ng-prod
```

Any new Jira connectors that you create must include the new `auth` object, and you must use its nested `username` and `passwordRef` fields for authentication. 

The new fields override the previously used `username` and `passwordRef` authentication fields. The older fields are now deprecated.
 
These changes are backward incompatible. Therefore, you must also update the Terraform provider for creating a Jira connector to the latest version (version 0.14.12) so that these new fields are provided. You also need to provide these new fields in API calls that create or update a Jira connector.

### Harness Platform

- Sorting functionality is available on the triggers listing page. (PL-31530)

  You can sort triggers according to the following: 
  - Name
  - Creation date
  
- The [List User Groups API](https://apidocs.harness.io/tag/User-Group/#operation/getUserGroupList) now supports `INCLUDE_CHILD_SCOPE_GROUPS` as an additional filter type value. (PL-31353)
  
  This filter allows API responses to include child-scoped user groups. 
  
- You can now access your account immediately after resetting your password. (PL-30878)

- You can configure the HashiCorp Vault connector to use AWS Auth authentication without providing `X-Vault-AWS-IAM-Server-ID`. (PL-30628, ZD-36826,39745)
  
  It is now an optional field. 
  
- In the execution view, failed stages are now sorted before success stages when parallel stages are used. (PIE-2518)
  
  This makes it easier to choose failed stages.
  
- The feature flag `FF_ALLOW_OPTIONAL_VARIABLE` now lets you make runtime variables optional in pipelines and stages. (PIE-8209)

### Harness Delegate

- The delegate installation UI experience is now updated with a new installation method: the Terraform Helm provider. Also, the installation experience has been enhanced for the existing methods (Helm chart, Kubernetes manifest, and Docker). This new experience is more developer friendly. For example, it enables cutting and pasting of relevant commands. You can also automate the commands and use new values when necessary. 

  Additionally, the following new features are available:
    - The **Terraform Helm Provider** method is based on the open source [Terraform Harness Delegate module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/harness/harness-delegate/kubernetes/latest) and the open source [Harness Delegate Helm chart](https://github.com/harness/delegate-helm-chart). Auto upgrade is set to `OFF` with an option to enable it in the command.
    - The updated method for **Helm Chart** is also based on the same open source [Harness Delegate Helm chart](https://github.com/harness/delegate-helm-chart) as the Terraform Helm provider. Auto upgrade is set to OFF with an option to enable it in the command. You can also download the [default values.yaml](https://github.com/harness/delegate-helm-chart/blob/main/harness-delegate-ng/values.yaml) for the Helm option and edit that to set your own long-lived configuration values.
    - The updated flow for **Kubernetes Manifest** has the following options for creating a manifest YAML file specific to your Harness account.          
      - **Basic**: Provides a **Download YAML** option. The downloaded YAML has all the configuration variables set to values that are specific to your Harness account. 
      - **Custom** - Create your own YAML from a [Kubernetes manifest template](https://github.com/harness/delegate-kubernetes-manifest/blob/main/harness-delegate.yaml) by replacing the placeholders with the values provided in the method.
      Given the need to have a fully qualified YAML, the auto upgrade configuration is set to ON in both the above options. Consequently, the delegate version that is installed always remains in sync with the version available on Harness Manager.
    - The **Docker** delegate installation method has now been simplified to a copy-and-paste action on the `docker run` command, with the option to modify the preset values. The auto upgrade is set to OFF for this method, with an option to enable it in the command. (DEL-6037)

- The secrets manager cache was moved from Redis to the Harness Manager's local pod. (DEL-5884)

 This move further enhances security because the secrets manager configuration no longer goes outside of the Harness Manager's pod.
 
## March 2, 2023

### Security Testing Orchestration

- The Twistlock integration has been upgraded to use version 22.12.582. (STO-5575)
- The Brakeman, Nikto, and Nmap scanner integrations now enable you to customize scans by passing CLI arguments to the scanner via the `tool_args` setting. (STO-5465)
- The Bandit scanner integration now enables you to customize scans by passing CLI arguments to the scanner via the `tool_args` setting. (STO-5415)
- The Mend integration now supports SCA scans. (STO-5242)
- Bandit scan results have been enhanced. When you open the Details pane for a detected issue, the Raw Details JSON now includes links to further information under `_rawIssueCwe : link` and `_rawMoreInfo`. (STO-5422)
- The Security Testing Dashboard includes a new set of filters for drilling down into specific issues by project, creation date, scanner, target, pipeline, severity, and so on. You can drill down to a set of relevant issues and then click on a pie slice, chart element, or other UI element to view details on the relevant issues. (STO-5329)
  
  Note the following:

  - The Security Testing Dashboard requires an Enterprise account.
  - You must click the **Refresh** button (top right) to apply the filter after you configure it.
  - The **Created Date** menu has several non-working options: `is null`, `is not null`, and `matches a user attribute`. This is a known issue that Harness is working to address.

## March 1, 2023

### Cloud Cost Management

* AutoStopping Proxy for HTTPS and TCP connections.

 Harness CCM introduces **AutoStopping Proxy** to support AutoStopping for HTTPS and TCP connections. For more information, go to [Add load balancers](https://developer.harness.io/docs/category/add-load-balancer-for-autostopping-rules) and [Create AutoStopping rules](https://developer.harness.io/docs/category/create-autostopping-rules).

* Introducing support for adding more than one CCM GCP connector when you have two or more billing export tables with different billing account IDs in the same dataset. (CCM-11244)
* Introducing support for assigning a custom static port as the source port in the port configuration of the TCP traffic-based AutoStopping rule. (CCM-11264)

## February 23, 2023, version 78507

### Harness Platform

- The new delegate installation wizard is now generally available. (PL-31305)
  
  You also have the option to revert to the previous installation method if desired.


-  A warning message now appears in the UI when you delete a project or organization. Deletions require confirmation from the user. (PL-31292)
  
  ```mdx-code-block
  <img src={delete_project} alt="delete-project" height="150" width="400"></img>
  ```

  This enhancement prevents the accidental deletion of important projects or organizations and provides an extra layer of caution for users.

- The reference page for entities is improved to provide detailed information about each reference. (PL-31247)

  The following details are added to the existing reference pages:

  - Date or timestamp 
  - Name and type of entity
  - Scope of reference

  These enhancements provide comprehensive information about each reference.

- Sorting functionality is available on the project listing page and the project selector dropdown. (PL-27493)
  With this enhancement, you can easily sort and find projects you need and organize them according to your preferences.

- You can now change stages without losing the values you enter in the **Run Pipeline** form. (PIE-4663)

### Continuous Integration

In addition to fixed values and runtime inputs, you can now use [expressions](/docs/platform/References/runtime-inputs#expressions) for the **Repository Name** in your pipelines' input sets, triggers, and codebase configuration settings. This is useful for pipelines that you use with multiple repositories. (CI-6657, ZD-38657)

![The CI pipeline codebase configuration settings window.](static/ci-pipeline-codebase-reponame-exp.png)

## February 15, 2023, version 78421

### Continuous Integration

* Microsoft Windows (amd64) is now a supported [Harness Cloud](/docs/continuous-integration/ci-quickstarts/hosted-builds-on-virtual-machines-quickstart) build infrastructure option. (CI-5455)
* **Python** is now available as a built-in **Shell** option for [Run steps](/docs/continuous-integration/ci-technical-reference/run-step-settings). (CI-6692)
* [Run steps](/docs/continuous-integration/ci-technical-reference/run-step-settings) can now reference images in GCR through [GCP connectors](/docs/platform/Connectors/connect-to-google-cloud-platform-gcp) that use inherited credentials. (CI-5758, ZD-38986)
  * GCP connectors are authenticated through either a GCP service account key or by inheriting credentials from the Harness delegate running in GCP. This change improves how you can use GCP connectors with inherited credentials in your pipelines.
  * Previously, if you wanted a Run step to call an image in GRC, the GCP connector attached to your Run step had to use service account key authentication. Now, the GCP connector can use either authentication method.
* Use [Background steps](/docs/continuous-integration/ci-technical-reference/background-step-settings) to configure service dependencies. (CI-5580)
  * The Background step allows for better control and configuration of services than the now-deprecated Configure Service Dependency step.
  * Pipelines with Configure Service Dependency steps remain backwards compatible, but this step is not available for new pipelines.
  * Replace Configure Service Dependency steps with Background steps to take advantage of the more robust control and configuration option.
* [Pipeline execution status links](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/view-your-builds/viewing-builds) in Git pull requests now direct you to the associated stage within the pipeline, rather than the pipeline as a whole. (CI-6813)
* Improved handling of Azure repo URLs in [Git webhook pipeline triggers](/docs/platform/triggers/triggering-pipelines). (CI-5720)

### Delegate version 78306

This release introduces the following new features and enhancements:

- Added the `helm repo update` command to the delegate installer. The command is included in the instructions that apply the delegate manifest. This change reduces the chance of retrieving the wrong file from the repository. (DEL-5540)

### Harness Platform

- The Redisson client library has been upgraded to version 3.17.7 across all services for enhanced performance and bug resolution. (PL-31136)
  This update will not affect any business operations.

- The [Role Assignment](https://apidocs.harness.io/tag/Role-Assignments/#operation/getFilteredRoleAssignmentByScopeList) API now includes the principal's name and email address in the response.(PL-31064, ZD-36050)

- Harness now supports the integration of GCP Secrets Manager for all users. (PL-31051)
  
  For more information, see [Add a Google Cloud Secret Manager](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/Security/add-a-google-cloud-secret-manager)

- There is a limit on the number of entities that can be created for **FREE** and **COMMUNITY** users in Harness. (PL-30838)
  
  Following are the entity creation limits: 

  - Project - 100
  - Secrets - 100
  - Variables - 100
  - User groups -100
  - Service accounts - 100

- You can now add policy sets under the **Advanced** section of each step. (PIE-7794)

  In this way, you can validate step outputs generated during pipeline execution without explicitly requesting a payload. Policy sets receive the steps and their outputs as payloads, with a pre-defined schema for every step.

- Accessing the CD module redirects you to one of the following: 

  - Get Started: If you don't have any pipelines in your project.

  - Deployment list page: This is the default selection page. (PIE-7625)

## February 6, 2023, version 78321

### Continuous Delivery

- Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) is now supported for ServiceNow authentication. (CDS-49406, CDS-49229)
  
  Any API call Harness makes to ServiceNow requires an authentication token. Previously, Harness supported username and password authentication only. Now we support ADFS authentication.

  ![ADFS](static/9460e1a9c71864311b8a7d0ef1e1508bb6616649161bcf2cf932c9f4442a51d6.png)

### Continuous Integration

- Linux ARM is now supported in [Harness Cloud](/docs/continuous-integration/ci-quickstarts/hosted-builds-on-virtual-machines-quickstart) build infrastructures. (CI-5787)
- The Harness UI now shows a detailed warning when a CI build uses unsupported versions of any CI build images. (CI-6721)

### Harness Platform

- The pages in app.harness.io autofocus the search input box by default. (PL-30656)
  
  This results in a seamless search experience.

- Entity names can now include the `/` character. (PL-29929)
- [Looping strategies](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/pipelines/looping-strategies-matrix-repeat-and-parallelism/), including matrix and parallelism strategies, are no longer behind a feature flag. (PIE-5010)

### Security Testing Orchestration

* You can now ingest results from a specific Checkmarx scan. This option is useful for ensuring that a pipeline ingests the scan triggered by a specific event. Add the setting `product_scan_id` = `MY_SCAN_ID` to the Checkmarx step. This overrides the default behavior, which is to ingest results for the most recent scan. (STO-5424)	

* You can now enable debug-level logging for Snyk and Aqua Trivy scans. To do this, add this setting to the scan step: `log_level` = `debug`. (STO-5405)

* Grype scans now support a `tool_args` field. You can use this field to run the plugin with specific command-line arguments. To scan all layers in an image, for example, add this setting to the Grype scan step: `tool_args` = `--scope all-layers`. (STO-5400)

* To make the Issue Details pane easier to navigate, Raw Details JSON data is now collapsed by default. (STO-5398)	

## February 3, 2023

### Security Testing Orchestration

* The Issue Details pane now shows the message “No recommendations are available at this time” when the scan tool doesn't return remediation steps for a specific issue. (STO-5380)

## January 29, 2023

### Continuous Integration

- CI pipelines now support workflows that can run with some runtime inputs undefined. Previously a pipeline would fail if any runtime input was undefined for any field such as an environment variable, label, build argument, or port binding. (CI-5116 , ZD-33893, ZD-34255)


## January 17, 2023

### Continuous Delivery

- YAML schema validation for environments. (CDS-48947)
  
  We have added YAML schema validation to environment entities. Similar validation already exists for our pipeline YAML, but environments are separate entities.
  If you try to save invalid YAML you will get an error like this:
  ```bash
  Invalid yaml: $.environment.overrides.manifests[0].manifest.spec: is missing but it is required.
  ```
- Improved error message when API calls fail while listing Helm **Chart Version** in **Run Pipeline**. (CDS-48436)
  
  If **Chart Version** is a runtime input, when you run the pipeline you are required to select a version from the **Chart Version** dropdown. If the Harness API is unable to fetch any versions, an improved error message is displayed.

  ![picture 21](static/8ca12a2c84cf95499024fd11b11c055bc13ec9de4e0e767ae6f8422aeb596d91.png)  
  
  Hover over the error message to see the full message.

### Continuous Integration

* This release includes two new CI steps for integrating your Harness CI pipelines with GitHub Actions and Bitrise. The following steps are available in Harness Cloud build infrastructures only. 
   - An Actions step to run GitHub Actions.
   - A Bitrise step to run Bitrise steps and workflows. (CI-6479)
* Harness CI now supports remote debugging of remote builds in Harness Cloud, Kubernetes, and VMs in AWS, Azure, and other cloud platforms. If a build fails at a Run step, you can rerun the build in debug mode. This option is available in the **Builds**, **Execution**, and **Execution History** pages of the Harness UI. (CI-6350) 
   
  ![](./static/ci-rerun-build-in-debug-mode.png) 

* You can now specify hostnames instead of IPs in Kubernetes build infrastructures. This enables your pipelines to communicate with external services using hostnames. The following Harness YAML snippet shows how to set up aliases for your cluster in the CI stage **Infrastructure** section. (CI-5996, ZD-36578)

``` yaml 
infrastructure:
    type: KubernetesDirect
    spec:
      connectorRef: account.test
      namespace: harness-delegate
    hostNames:
      - abc.com
      - xyz.com
```
  
### Harness Platform

- A dedicated release notes page was introduced for Harness Delegate. You can find the delegate release notes at [Delegate](/release-notes/delegate).

## January 15, 2023		

### Security Testing Orchestration

* Aqua Trivy scans now support a `tool_args` field. You can use this field to run the plugin with specific command-line arguments. To run an offline scan, for example, `specify tool_args` = `---offline-scan`. (STO-5388)	


## January 10, 2023, version 78105

### Continuous Delivery

- A [failure strategy](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/pipelines/w_pipeline-steps-reference/step-failure-strategy-settings/) is now mandatory for all Deploy stages. (CDS-48951)  
  
  ![failure strategy](static/3c690f9ba44e7cac1e6ccb605068b676ddd02f247f37c2d9b2524f30437c97ff.png)

  A failure strategy is now a mandatory setting in the **Deploy** stage. Previously, a failure strategy was mandatory, but the check happened when the pipeline ran. 
  
  A failure strategy is also required for the **Deploy** stage in [stage templates](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/templates/add-a-stage-template/). With this release, all Deploy stages, including in stage templates, without failure strategies are considered invalid.

  No action required by users.
- UI enhancements for remote templates created in non-default or feature branches. (CDS-48308)
  
  If a remote template is created in a non-default or feature branch, Harness fetches the template details from the created branch and displays them on the template studio/listing page. You no longer need to manually select the correct branch.

  No action required by users.
- Absolute paths for Native Helm charts [Custom Remote Manifest](/docs/continuous-delivery/cd-advanced/cd-kubernetes-category/add-a-custom-remote-script-and-manifests) are now supported. (CDS-47647, RN-37501)
  
  Previously, Harness CD looked for a path relative to the Harness working directory, which is a temporary directory that Harness creates. Now, you can specify an absolute path in **Extracted Manifest File Location** by starting with a forward slash `/`. For example: `/tmp/myChart1/custom-remote-test-repo/helm/todolist/`.

  ![Custom Remote Manifest](static/b401a79386824c0b00a74ad4d9ec4576db712982f9371c8e80e0913d5e4aa14a.png)

  No action required by users.

### Harness Platform

- Secrets and connectors now have a character limit of 128 for the **Name** and **ID** fields. (PL-29887)
  
- The [Role-Assignments](https://apidocs.harness.io/tag/Role-Assignments/#operation/getFilteredRoleAssignmentByScopeList) API now fetches role assignments by scope. (PL-29496, ZD-36050)

  This helps you keep a track of the role assignments within a specific scope.
  
- The repository location of the Helm chart for the NextGen delegate is changing. (DEL-5576) 

  The repository is being deprecated. Updates to the chart will not be made to [https://app.harness.io/storage/harness-download/delegate-helm-chart/](https://app.harness.io/storage/harness-download/delegate-helm-chart/) and will not be available from that location. To ensure retrieval of the most recent Helm chart, update your repository references to [https://app.harness.io/storage/harness-download/harness-helm-charts/](https://app.harness.io/storage/harness-download/harness-helm-charts/).
  
## January 8, 2023		

### Security Testing Orchestration

* Checkmarx scans now support a `tool_args` field. You can use this field to run the Checkmarx plugin with specific command-line arguments. To run an incremental scan, for example, `specify tool_args` = `-incremental`. (STO-5041)	

* STO now supports orchestrated scans using [Grype](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/sto-techref-category/grype-scanner-reference). (STO-5161)	

## January 1, 2023	

### Security Testing Orchestration

* The Issues Details pane has been revised to make it easier to navigate. Raw JSON data now appears at the bottom of each occurrence and is collapsed by default. (STO-4839)	


## December 22, 2022, version 77908

### Harness Platform

-   You can now get the service provider configuration, schema, and a list of all the supported resource types corresponding to SCIM applications through API. (PL-29069)

    To facilitate the discovery of SCIM service provider features and schema, SCIM defines the following three HTTP GET endpoints:

    -   ServiceProviderConfig

    -   ResourceType

    -   Schemas

    Harness now supports these three API endpoints.

### Continuous Delivery

- [Deployment Templates](/docs/continuous-delivery/onboard-cd/cd-quickstarts/custom-deployment-tutorial) **Execution** tab now supports all steps in Command category (CDS-48030)
  - Earlier, only the Utilities steps were supported.
  - Now you can add any CD step.
+ Support for absolute paths in [Custom Remote Manifest](/docs/continuous-delivery/cd-advanced/cd-kubernetes-category/add-a-custom-remote-script-and-manifests/) for Helm Charts (CDS-47647, ZD-37501) 
  - Previously, we were only looking for a path relative to Harness working directory (a temporary directory created by Harness).
  - Now, you can specify an absolute path in **Extracted Manifest File Location** by starting with a forward slash `/`.
  - Example: `/tmp/myChart1/custom-remote-test-repo/helm/todolist/`.
- **Referenced By** tab added to [Environments](/docs/continuous-delivery/onboard-cd/cd-concepts/services-and-environments-overview) (CDS-39989)
  - You can see which pipeline use any Environment in the Environment's **Referenced By** tab.

- The [Deployment Templates](/docs/continuous-delivery/onboard-cd/cd-quickstarts/custom-deployment-tutorial) **Execution** tab now supports all steps in the Command category. (CDS-48030)

  Earlier, only the Utilities steps were supported. Now you can add any CD step.

- Support for absolute paths in a [Custom Remote Manifest](/docs/continuous-delivery/cd-advanced/cd-kubernetes-category/add-a-custom-remote-script-and-manifests/) for Helm Charts. (CDS-47647, ZD-37501) 

  Previously, we were only looking for a path relative to the Harness working directory (a temporary directory created by Harness). Now, you can specify an absolute path in **Extracted Manifest File Location** by starting with a forward slash `/`.

  Example: `/tmp/myChart1/custom-remote-test-repo/helm/todolist/`.

- The **Referenced By** tab was added to [Environments](/docs/continuous-delivery/onboard-cd/cd-concepts/services-and-environments-overview). (CDS-39989)

  You can see which pipeline uses any Environment in the Environment's **Referenced By** tab.

### Continuous Integration

* Customers on the free plan can now run 5 stages per day on the CI hosted infrastructure. Contact Harness Sales to upgrade your plan. (CI-6430)

* The onboarding workflow now caters to customers who do not have a codebase with which to connect. (CI-6348)

## December 18, 2022			

### Security Testing Orchestration

* Remediated issues are no longer included in the issue counts logged near the end of a Security Step run and provided as output variables. (STO-5304)	

*  With this release, you can run a SonarQube scan and specify a collection of SSL certificates rather than a single certificate. This option is useful when you don't know which specific certificate in a collection is required by the server. (STO-5243)	

## December 13, 2022, version 77808

### Continuous Delivery

- ServiceNow Connector YAML has changed to include authentication details. (CDS-46672, CDS-45969)

  **The update is minor and requires no changes by users.**

- Harness Serverless Lambda and ECS support now supports AWS S3 (CDS-46204, CDS-45642)

  You can now use AWS S3 for your Serverless YAML and ECS configuration files (Task Definition, Service Definition, Scaling Policy, and Scalable Target JSON/YAML files).

- The <+rollbackArtifact...> expression is now available (CDS-46321)

  For example, if you used a publicly available Docker Hub NGINX image as the Artifact Source for a Service, then when the Service is rolled back, the <+rollbackArtifact.meta.image> expression output would be something like this: registry.hub.docker.com/library/nginx:stable-perl.

  The variables available in rollbackArtifact depends on the artifact and infrastructure type used in the deployment. They can be seen in Output tab of Infrastructure section of a CD stage.

  There are many different available, demonstrated in this script:

        echo <+rollbackArtifact.bucketName>

        echo <+rollbackArtifact.buildNo>

        echo <+rollbackArtifact.buildFullDisplayName>

        echo <+rollbackArtifact.ArtifactPath>

        echo <+rollbackArtifact.description>

        echo <+rollbackArtifact.displayName>

        echo <+rollbackArtifact.fileName>

        echo <+rollbackArtifact.key>

        echo <+rollbackArtifact.metadata.image>

        echo <+rollbackArtifact.metadata.tag>

        echo <+rollbackArtifact.source.registryUrl>

        echo <+rollbackArtifact.url>

### Harness Platform

- You can now refer to existing secrets of Azure Key Vault, AWS secret manager, and GCP secret manager. (PL-29915)

  With this enhancement, you need not create secrets in Harness. You can use expressions to reference the secrets already existing in the mentioned secrets managers. For more information, see [Reference Existing Secret Managers Secrets](https://developer.harness.iohttps://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/security/reference-existing-secret-manager-secrets/).

- You can now use the Git client to commit changes while creating or updating pipelines using Bitbucket on-prem as the Git provider. (PIE-6423)

  To do this, enable Use Git client for commits in the default settings at the account scope. Harness checks out the code on the delegate and uses the Git client to make the commits to your Git repository.

## December 11, 2023			

### Security Testing Orchestration
	
* STO is now supported on Linux (amd64 and arm64 platforms) in Harness Cloud. (STO-5314)	

* Instead of using Service Dependencies for Docker-in-Docker configuration, users should use new Background steps. (STO-5268)


## December 7, 2022, version 77716

### Continuous Delivery

Helm steady state checks with Kubernetes version >= 1.16 (CDS-40269)

Harness will automatically perform steady state checks with Helm deployments using Kubernetes version >= 1.16.
This feature was previously behind the HELM_STEADY_STATE_CHECK_1_16 feature flag and is now GA.

### Harness Platform

Securing data through JSON Web Token (JWT) masking. (PL-29019, ZD-32004)

Harness now masks all JWTs in pipelines and delegate logs. This change prevents data leakage risks for the applications running in Harness.

## December 2, 2022, version 0.4.2

### Chaos Engineering

- Update feature for chaos hub enables users to update details such as `Git Connector`, `Repository Name`, `Branch Name` and `Name` for an already connected chaos hub.

- Adds CDN Support for Chaos module static artifacts thereby loading the UI with reduced latency on client devices.

- Adds version information in the ChaosDriver and ChaosManager. Hence, the versions are available over endpoints `/chaos/driver/api/version` and `/chaos/manager/api/version` for ChaosDriver and ChaosManager, respectively.

- Adds a range filter dropdown in the `Experiment Runs` bar graph under `Experiment overview` allowing you to set the range on the last runs shown in the graph.

- Adds support for all fault statuses in the `Experiment Runs` graph. Apart from `Failed` and `Passed` states being shown, faults in `Awaited`, `Stopped` and `N/A` states are also available under the `Experiment Runs` graph.

- Adds manifest download button in the UI for Chaos Infrastructures that enables you to have a seamless upgrade.

- Adds consistent loaders for all components and screens in the UI.

## November 29, 2022

### Harness Platform

- Fix to help you identify Harness in your two-factor authentication app. (PL-29563)

  The default name of the entry for Harness in two-factor authentication (2FA) apps such as Google Authenticator now begins with Harness\_. This change enables you to identify the correct entry, and to therefore use the correct code, for authenticating to Harness. If you configured 2FA for Harness before this change, remove the existing entry and reconfigure 2FA to see the new name.

- Direct use of email addresses in v2 APIs for creating and updating user groups. (PL-29018)

  You can now use email addresses in v2 APIs for creating or updating a user group. It is no longer required to first fetch the email addresses by using user IDs

- You can now create user groups inline when setting up the Approval stage in a pipeline. (PL-28022)

  This is helpful when the user group that needs to be sent notifications does not already exist. The scope of the user group is within the project corresponding to the pipeline.

  The Harness UI now lists the versions of services in your account settings. To see the versions, go to Account Settings > Overview, and then expand Platform Service Versions. (PL-26581)

- Approval messages in Harness approvals can now have expressions in multiple lines. (PIE-6238, ZD-36667,37069)

- Harness service variables now support dots (.). (PIE-4613)

  This is helpful when you have JSON/YAML files where you want to update the keys with some values. You can define variables for those keys in harness with (.) to access the keys. The expression to access a key would be:

  <+variables.get("example.key")>

- You can now drag the step details section and move it to the desired location. (PIE-3890)

- You need not enter the Tags or Description while importing an entity from Git. (PIE-6171)

  The corresponding information for these fields are fetched from Git.

### Continuous Integration

- New Subscription ID field. (CI-6032)
  An Azure subscription ID is now required in the Build and Push ACR step to enable the display of artifacts uploaded by the steps on the Artifacts tab.

- New background step to define the service dependency. (CI-5580)
  A new background step has been added to define the service dependency in CI. The previous stage settings of service dependency are now deprecated. The new background step allows for better control and configuration of services.

## November 21, 2022

### Continuous Delivery

- Fetch Helm Chart Versions from Source on Run Pipeline UI (CDS-40390)

  Now you can set Helm Chart version using a runtime input (when using HTTP Helm, S3, and GCS stores), view the list of chart versions available at runtime, and select the required one.

  For Helm deployment information, go to [Helm Chart deployment tutorial](https://developer.harness.io/docs/continuous-delivery/onboard-cd/cd-quickstarts/helm-cd-quickstart/).

- Copy of Service and Environment variables (CDS-38870, ZD-37291)

  You can now copy the FQNs for Service and Environment variables. The Service variables use the format <+serviceVariables.[variable name]> and Environment variables use the format `<env.variables.[variable name]>`.

### Feature Flags

A new React Client SDK has been released for Feature Flags as version 1.0.0. For more information about this SDK and how to integrate with it, go to the [React Client Reference Guide](https://developer.harness.io/docs/category/client-sdk-guides/) and the [React Client GitHub repository](https://github.com/harness/ff-react-client-sdk).

## November 11, 2022

### Continuous Delivery

- Helm steady state checks with Kubernetes version >= 1.16 (CDS-40269)

  Harness will automatically perform steady state checks with Helm deployments using Kubernetes version >= 1.16.

  This feature was previously behind the HELM_STEADY_STATE_CHECK_1_16 feature flag and is now GA.

- Support for the Command step is added Deployment Template deployment types (CDS-45189)

  Now you can use the Command step in a Deployment Template pipeline. Using this step you can download/copy the artifact, copy the config files, or run scripts on the instances output by the Fetch Instances step.

  The Command step will always run on the Delegate, hence you need to enable the Run On Delegate option.

  The Command step should always be run after the the Fetch Instances step.

  See [Use the Command step to download, copy, or run scripts](https://developer.harness.io/docs/continuous-delivery/cd-execution/cd-general-steps/download-and-copy-artifacts-using-the-command-step).

### Harness Platform

- You can now send email notifications to all the members of a user group by selecting the Send email to all users part of the user group option.(PL-29434, ZD-32444)

  For existing user groups, this is the default option.

- The organization filter selection on the project listing page will now persist across user sessions and page navigations.(PL-29292)

  You can now see the versions of the services in Account Overview in Platform Service Versions.(PL-26581)

## November 6, 2022

### Harness Platform

The option to disable Harness Secret Manager is now a part of the core settings in Account Default Settings. (PL-27160)

### Continuous Integration

The Custom Git Connector now supports connection via the Harness Platform, in addition to the ability to connect through the Harness Delegate. Connecting through Harness Secrets Manager is required to use the generic git connector on the Harness Cloud build infrastructure hosted by Harness. (CI-5666)

### Security Testing Orchestration

* You can now include Run steps in Security Test stages. You can also include Security Tests stages in STO pipelines without a CI license. (STO-5208)

* You can now configure a pipeline to ingest Snyk data from multiple files and paths. For an example of how to set this up, go to [Ingest Scan Results from Snyk](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/use-sto/snyk-scans). (STO-4958)	


## October 31, 2022

### Security Testing Orchestration

- New output variables – This release includes a new set of output variables you can use to determine the next stage of your pipeline. These variables show the number of new issues detected in the current scan compared to the last scan. If this is the first scan for the target, these variables reflect new issues compared to the baseline. You can use these variables to determine the next stage of your pipeline:

  - NEW_CRITICAL
  - NEW_HIGH
  - NEW_MEDIUM

### Continuous Integration

The Infrastructure tab in Build steps has been updated to show only supported options when a Hosted build infrastructure is selected. (CI-5737)

## Harness Platform

- The functionality of the delegate auto-upgrade components was enhanced. On installation, the AutoUpgrade feature displays a status message of Synchronizing. If the component does not receive an API call from the upgrader within 90 minutes, the status message changes to OFF. This affects delegates that are installed with upgrader components.

  For more information about delegate auto-upgrade, see [Delegate Auto-Update](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/delegates/delegate-guide/delegate-auto-update/).

- A loader is now displayed on click of Run Pipeline to indicate that the Pipeline is running. (PIE-5396)

### Feature Flags

You can now add a default pipeline to your Feature Flags that will be applied when you add targeting rules, or when you enable or disable a Flag. This means that you can ensure your Flag changes go through the process you want them to, allowing for better security and more consistent operations. For example, you can add an approval step so all your production Flag changes must be approved before they are executed, or you can send a Slack notification every time a Flag changes.

For more information about how to use a default pipeline for your Flags, go to [Add a Default Pipeline for Flag Changes](https://developer.harness.io/docs/feature-flags/ff-using-flags/ff-build-pipeline/default-pipeline-ff/).

  For more information, go to: [ECS deployment tutorial](https://developer.harness.io/docs/continuous-delivery/onboard-cd/cd-quickstarts/ecs-deployment-tutorial/).

- Traditional deployments using SSH or WinRM: deploy your artifacts to hosts located in Microsoft Azure, AWS, or any platform-agnostic Physical Data Center (PDC).

  These deployments are called Traditional because they use Secure Shell and PowerShell scripts and a traditional runtime environment as opposed to containers and orchestration mechanisms, like Kubernetes.

  For more information, go to:

  [Secure Shell (SSH) deployment tutorial](https://developer.harness.io/docs/continuous-delivery/onboard-cd/cd-quickstarts/ssh-ng/)

  [WinRM deployment tutorial](https://developer.harness.io/docs/continuous-delivery/onboard-cd/cd-quickstarts/win-rm-tutorial)

- Custom deployments using Deployment templates: In some cases, you might be using a platform that does not have first class support in Harness, such as OpenStack, WebLogic, WebSphere, Google Cloud functions, etc. We call these non-native deployments. For non-native deployments, Harness provides a custom deployment option using Deployment Templates.

  For more information, go to: [Custom deployments using Deployment Templates tutorial](https://developer.harness.io/docs/continuous-delivery/onboard-cd/cd-quickstarts/custom-deployment-tutorial).

  - At Account Scope, Account Basic/Account Viewer - All Account Resources​.​
  - At Organization scope, Organization Viewer - All Organization Resources.​​
  - At Project Scope, Project Viewer - All Project Resources.​​

- Harness now has a default User Group at each scope. ​These groups have all the users at the respective scope as their members. As a part of this change, Harness will stop assigning any roles to the User Groups by default.​ Users can assign roles to the default User Group at a specific scope, which becomes the default role for all the users in that group. (PL-26145)

  See [Harness Default User Groups](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/role-based-access-control/harness-default-user-groups/).

## September 14, 2022
