#### Feature Experimentation
##### Sequential Testing Update
Sequential Testing will now be the default statistical method for all net-new organizations using monitoring and experimentation.Â 
The minimum sample size for [Sequential Testing](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360020640752-Monitor-and-experiment-settings#minimum-sample-size) has been reduced from 200 to 100. This allows users to get statistically significant results, faster.
##### Dimensional Analysis Update
Users can now create up to [20 dimensions with 20 values per dimension](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/14824241665421-Using-dimensional-analysis#configuring-dimensions-and-values). This gives users even more flexibility when doing a deeper analysis of their feature experiments or releases.
