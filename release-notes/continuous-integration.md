## March 31, 2023, version 78914

### What's new

* When you [use a GitHub App in a GitHub connector](/docs/platform/connectors/git-hub-app-support/#step-5-use-github-app-and-secret-in-harness-github-connector), you can now use encrypted text secrets for the **Installation ID** and **Application ID**. (CI-7380)
* Added a [codebase expression](/docs/continuous-integration/ci-technical-reference/built-in-cie-codebase-variables-reference) for commit messages: `<+codebase.commitMessage>`. (CI-7222)

### Early access

This release does not include early access features.

### Fixed issues

Fixed an issue related to secrets resolution in the [GitHub Action plugin step](/docs/continuous-integration/ci-technical-reference/ci-github-action-step). (CI-6969, CI-7300)

## March 24, 2023, version 78817

### What's new

* [Cache Intelligence](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/caching-ci-data/cache-intelligence/) is now generally available. With Cache Intelligence, Harness automatically caches and restores common dependencies. You don't need to bring your own storage because Harness stores the cache in the Harness-hosted environment, Harness Cloud. (CI-7127)
* [Harness Cloud](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/set-up-build-infrastructure/use-harness-cloud-build-infrastructure) build infrastructure now supports **Run as User** for [Plugin](/docs/continuous-integration/ci-technical-reference/plugin-step-settings-reference) and [Run](/docs/continuous-integration/ci-technical-reference/run-step-settings) steps that are running on containers. (CI-7320)

### Early access

This release does not include early access features.

### Fixed issues

* You can now use [variable expressions](/docs/platform/references/runtime-inputs/#expressions) for the **Shell** and **Image Pull Policy** settings. Previously, selecting the **Expression** input type for **Shell** caused a UI-breaking error, and providing an expression for **Image Pull Policy** caused a field validation error. (CI-7071, ZD-40277)
* If a CI pipeline fails at the **Initialize** step due to an [Azure Repos connector](/docs/platform/connectors/connect-to-a-azure-repo/) having an on-premises **Azure Repos Project URL**, the error message clearly describes the root cause. This failure occurs because CI doesn't support Azure DevOps Server Repositories (also known as _on-premises Azure Repos_). (CI-6322)
* If you configure a [code repo connector](/docs/category/code-repo-connectors) where the **URL Type** is **Account**, the **Connection Test** now shows the full test repo URL, which is the URL used to test the connection, rather than the account URL. (CI-4398)
* Attempting to manually clone a PR through a Git connector that doesn't have API access enabled now returns an error message indicating that the connector doesn't have the required API access. (CI-7192)
* The deprecated Harness images warning banner no longer appears when there are no deprecated images in use. (CI-7335)

## March 15, 2023, version 78712

### What's new

* The [Base Image Connector setting](/docs/continuous-integration/ci-technical-reference/build-and-push-to-ecr-step-settings#base-image-connector) for the **Build and Push to ECR** step now supports all Docker-compliant registries. Previously, this setting only supported DockerHub registries. (CI-7153, CI-7091, ZD-40319)
* You can now call pipeline-level variables in steps as environment variables. This is an extension of existing functionality that allows you to call stage-level variables in steps as environment variables. (CI-6709, ZD-39203)
* When configuring [SCM connectors](/docs/category/code-repo-connectors):
  * Failed connection tests now return more detailed error messages. (CI-7089)
  * The placeholder text in the **Repository URL** field shows a complete repo URL example. (CI-5750)

### Early access

This release does not include early access features.

### Fixed issues

* When configuring [local build infrastructure](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/set-up-build-infrastructure/define-a-docker-build-infrastructure), it was not possible to select the Windows operating system. This issue has been resolved and the Windows OS is available again. (CI-7111, ZD-40311)
* Builds no longer fail if steps in different step groups have the same `identifier`. Additionally, to prevent steps in step groups from producing artifacts with identical artifact IDs, when steps in step groups produce artifacts, the resulting artifact IDs now use a unique identifier that reflects the step's presence in a step group. (CI-7115)
* If a pipeline's [codebase clone depth](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/codebase-configuration/create-and-configure-a-codebase#edit-codebase-configuration) was set to `0`, manually triggered builds would override this setting and clone at a depth of 50 instead. This issue did not occur for depth settings other than `0`, and it did not occur for non-manual triggers. Now, manually triggered builds won't override the depth setting when it is set to `0`. (CI-7083, ZD-40306)
* When manually triggering a build, the default repository is populated for on-prem Git connectors. (CI-6814)
* If you change a stage's build infrastructure after adding steps to the stage, field validations for step settings are now triggered as expected when building and saving pipelines. This is important for settings that are unavailable or optional with some build infrastructures but required for others. (CI-6209)
* Fixed an issue where builds triggered by issue comments had the incorrect PR status or link for some SCM providers. (CI-6978)
* Fixed several issues related to error messages on the [Build details page](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/view-your-builds/viewing-builds#build-details):
  * If the Docker runner was down for a build using local build infrastructure, the error message now contains the correct wording corresponding with the local build infrastructure, rather than wording relevant to a Kubernetes build infrastructure. (CI-6854)
  * An `unsupported image` warning banner incorrectly appeared for builds that did not use Kubernetes build infrastructure. (CI-7098, ZD-40428)
  * The `unsupported image` warning banner no longer pushes the bottom of the log region outside the scrollable area. (CI-7098, ZD-40428)
* Unresolved stage-level and pipeline-level environment variables generated exception errors in cases where those variables were expected to receive a value at a later point in the pipeline. These variables now supplement a default (`null`) value if no initial value is available. (CI-7125)

## February 23, 2023, version 78507

### What's new

In addition to fixed values and runtime inputs, you can now use [expressions](/docs/platform/References/runtime-inputs#expressions) for the **Repository Name** in your pipelines' input sets, triggers, and codebase configuration settings. This is useful for pipelines that you use with multiple repositories. (CI-6657, ZD-38657)

![The CI pipeline codebase configuration settings window.](static/ci-pipeline-codebase-reponame-exp.png)

### Early access

This release does not include early access features.

### Fixed issues

Modifying a step template's **Step Parameters** no longer removes failure strategies from the template's **Advanced** settings. (CI-6801, ZD-39108)
<!-- Alternate longer version: When you edit a step template that includes a failure strategy, modifying the template's **Step Parameters** no longer removes the **Failure Strategy** configuration from the template's **Advanced** settings. -->

## February 15, 2023, version 78421

### What's new

* Microsoft Windows (amd64) is now a supported [Harness Cloud](/docs/continuous-integration/ci-quickstarts/hosted-builds-on-virtual-machines-quickstart) build infrastructure option. (CI-5455)
* **Python** is now available as a built-in **Shell** option for [Run steps](/docs/continuous-integration/ci-technical-reference/run-step-settings). (CI-6692)
* [Run steps](/docs/continuous-integration/ci-technical-reference/run-step-settings) can now reference images in GCR through [GCP connectors](/docs/platform/Connectors/connect-to-google-cloud-platform-gcp) that use inherited credentials. (CI-5758, ZD-38986)
  * GCP connectors are authenticated through either a GCP service account key or by inheriting credentials from the Harness delegate running in GCP. This change improves how you can use GCP connectors with inherited credentials in your pipelines.
  * Previously, if you wanted a Run step to call an image in GRC, the GCP connector attached to your Run step had to use service account key authentication. Now, the GCP connector can use either authentication method.
* Use [Background steps](/docs/continuous-integration/ci-technical-reference/background-step-settings) to configure service dependencies. (CI-5580)
  * The Background step allows for better control and configuration of services than the now-deprecated Configure Service Dependency step.
  * Pipelines with Configure Service Dependency steps remain backwards compatible, but this step is not available for new pipelines.
  * Replace Configure Service Dependency steps with Background steps to take advantage of the more robust control and configuration option.
* [Pipeline execution status links](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/view-your-builds/viewing-builds) in Git pull requests now direct you to the associated stage within the pipeline, rather than the pipeline as a whole. (CI-6813)
* Improved handling of Azure repo URLs in [Git webhook pipeline triggers](/docs/platform/Triggers/triggering-pipelines). (CI-5720)

### Early access

This release does not include early access features.

### Deprecations

The Configure Service Dependency step is deprecated in favor of the [Background step](/docs/continuous-integration/ci-technical-reference/background-step-settings), which allows for better control and configuration of services. Pipelines with Configure Service Dependency steps remain backwards compatible, but this step is not available for new pipelines. Replace Configure Service Dependency steps with Background steps to take advantage of the more robust control and configuration options. (CI-5580)

### Fixed issues

* With the feature flag `NEW_LEFT_NAV_BAR` enabled, you can view build details at the project level without drilling down into individual modules. When viewing build details from the project level, the **Commits** tab produced a `404` error. This is fixed. (CI-6817)
* Expressions used in pipeline codebase properties unexpectedly resolved to `null`, which caused builds to fail due to missing variable input. These expressions now resolve to their expected values. (CI-6679, ZD-38122, ZD-38241, ZD-38698, ZD-39088)

   ![The CI Codebase Configuration window with the fields set to accept variable expression input.](static/ci-codebase-config-exp-values.png)

* The CI Getting Started workflow leads you through creating an SCM connector and a pipeline. Previously, exiting the Getting Started workflow before creating a pipeline resulted in incomplete connector configuration, and attempting to use the incomplete connector in a pipeline produced the following error: `Invalid argument(s): Both plain text and secret value cannot be null for the field`. If you encounter this error, replace the pipeline's SCM connector with a new one. (CI-6443)

## February 6, 2023, version 78321

### What's new

* Linux ARM is now supported in [Harness Cloud](/docs/continuous-integration/ci-quickstarts/hosted-builds-on-virtual-machines-quickstart) build infrastructures. (CI-5787)
* The Harness UI now shows a detailed warning when a CI build uses unsupported versions of any CI build images. (CI-6721)

### Early access features

This release does not include early access features.

### Fixed issues

* Improved the error message that appears in the UI when a Git test connection fails. (CI-6889)
* Fixed an issue where feature flags would sometimes not work with CI due to a backwards-compatibility issue. (CI-6687)
* Fixed an issue where the Commits tab would show a 404 error in the CD build UI. (CI-6632)

## January 17, 2023, version 78215

### What's new

* This release includes two new CI steps for integrating your Harness CI pipelines with GitHub Actions and Bitrise. The following steps are available in Harness Cloud build infrastructures only.
   - An Actions step to run GitHub Actions.
   - A Bitrise step to run Bitrise steps and workflows. (CI-6479)
* You can now specify hostnames instead of IPs in Kubernetes build infrastructures. This enables your pipelines to communicate with external services using hostnames. The following Harness YAML snippet shows how to set up aliases for your cluster in the CI stage **Infrastructure** section. (CI-5996, ZD-36578)

##### Defining hostnames to use in a Kubernetes build infrastructure

``` yaml
infrastructure:
    type: KubernetesDirect
    spec:
      connectorRef: account.test
      namespace: harness-delegate
    hostNames:
      - abc.com
      - xyz.com
```

## January 10, 2023, version 78105

### What's new

This release does not include new features.

### Early access features

This release does not include early access features.

### Fixed issues

* Fixed an issue in the onboarding UI. In some cases, the web UI did not connect with the specified git account immediately after OAuth setup. (CI-6518)
* You can now use codebase fields as expressions. Previously, when the codebase repository name was defined by `<+pipeline.name>`, the built-in variables `<+codebase.branch>` and `<+codebase.commitSha>` returned null. (CI-6478, ZD-38122, ZD-38241)
* Fixed an issue that prevented Azure connectors from connecting to repos with URLs that contained spaces or `%20`. (CI-6465)
* Fixed an issue where CI reported an upload to an S3 as successful even if the upload failed. (CI-6420, ZD-37931)
* Fixed an issue in the onboarding UI where the **Select Your Repository** progress bar was incorrect. (CI-6335)
* Fixed an issue where a build did not run when a user selected **Run** in the **Pipeline Editor** UI. To run the build, the user needed to go to the YAML editor, save, and then run. (CI-6239)
* Added a log entry when a CI step skips a directory when uploading to an S3 bucket. (CI-6205)

## December 22, 2022, version 77908

### What's new

* Customers on the free plan can now run 5 stages per day on the CI hosted infrastructure. Contact Harness Sales to upgrade your plan. (CI-6430)
* The onboarding experience for new users has been enhanced. You can now create a sample "Hello-world" pipeline even without a repository selected/created.  (CI-6348)

## December 13, 2022, version 77808

### What's new

This release does not include new features.

### Early access features

This release does not include early access features.

### Fixed issues

- Recently, Harness added a new background step to allow CI users to easily set service dependencies instead of using the stage setting for service dependencies. However, since the feature flag stage still relies on the stage service dependencies, this capability was added back to the UI with this fix. (CI-6308)
- An unnecessary view appeared momentarily in the new CI Get Started flow. This issue has been fixed. (CI-6103)
- Previously, users were unable to apply changes after updating the Language field in the Configure Run Tests Step because the Build Tool and Arguments fields were required. The Build Tool and Arguments can now be set dynamically using inputs, allowing users to add and edit the Configure Run Tests Step and save it as a template. (CI-4868)

  An Azure subscription ID is now required in the Build and Push ACR step to enable the display of artifacts uploaded by the steps on the Artifacts tab.

- New background step to define the service dependency. (CI-5580)
  A new background step has been added to define the service dependency in CI. The previous stage settings of service dependency are now deprecated. The new background step allows for better control and configuration of services.

### Early access features

This release does not include early access features.

### Deprecated features

- AWS Code Commit (CI-5665)
  The AWS Code Commit Git connector has been deprecated. Going forward, use the generic Git connector to integrate with AWS Code Commit.

- Service dependency stage settings. (CI-5580)

- A file artifact URL does not show for artifact type File. (CI-5872)
  A colon (:) appears instead of the file artifact URL.
  This issue has been fixed.

- Unable to run the Google Cloud Function Drone plugin (CI-5869)
  The issue occurs because unexpected \_uuid elements were being added to the settings.
  To resolve this issue, the \_uuid attribute was removed from the nested setting attribute in the CI plugin step type.

- Intermittent issue in which a hosted build cannot fetch a code repo due to an internal exception. (CI-5622)
  This issue has been fixed.

- You can now select Kotlin and Scala as languages in the Run Tests step when setting up Test Intelligence. You can also select sbt as a build tool for Scala. (CI-5653, CI-3333)

### Early access features

This release includes a new Docker delegate that you can install and run directly on a host. This feature is behind a Feature Flag CI_DOCKER_INFRASTRUCTURE. (CI-5680)

### Fixed issues

- UI fix: Improved alignment of the Repository Name field in the Build Stage setup wizard. (CI-5509)
  Fixed a back-end issue to ensure that a Bitbucket Connector with API enabled updates the status in Bitbucket as intended. (CI-5625)

- UI fix: When configuring a Service Dependency in an AWS or other cloud infrastructure, the UI should not show Kubernetes-only settings (Run as user, Privileged, and Resource Limits). CI-5628
  Previously added the Actor UUID in Sender for PR Comment webhook event for Bitbucket. Including this information in the other webhooks events as well. Now that the UUID is added, CI Manager can use this. (CI-5657)

- Fixed an issue that could cause CI builds to stall if the build process could not access the binary /usr/local/bin/split_tests. (CI-5664)
  Reverted a previous code change to ensure that a build on a VM infrastructures deletes the VM if the build gets aborted. (CI-5691)

## September 29, 2023, version 76921

### What's New

- CI pipelines now support workflows that can run with some runtime inputs undefined. Previously a pipeline would fail if any runtime input was undefined for any field such as an environment variable, label, build argument, or port binding. (CI-5116 , ZD-33893, ZD-34255)

### Early access features

This release does not include early access features.

### Fixed issues

- Fixed a UI issue when adding a new build stage to a new pipeline: when the user enters a name in the Repository Name field, the UI should show the repo URL getting generated under the field. (CI-5579)

- Added back-end validation to ensure that a user cannot create a Bitbucket connector with different usernames for standard and API Authentication access. (CI-5504, ZD-34241)
- Improved handling of GitHub registration requests and responses, which prevents trigger webhook creation failures in hosted build infrastructures. (CI-5251)
- Added logic to prevent a Null Pointer Exception if a user adds a AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID variable with no value to a pipeline. (CI-4884)
- Fixed an issue in the Run Tests step that could cause a manual build to fail if a Git branch was not specified. (CI-4581, ZD-34734)

## September 14, 2022, version 76708

### What's new

This release does not include new features.

### Early access features

This release does not include early access features.

### Fixed issues

- Added UI validation to ensure the Limit Memory and Limit CPU fields have the required formats. Previously, incorrect values for these fields were flagged during a build, which would cause the build to fail. (CI-5463)
- Added a force-kill flag to ensure that CI pods are deleted during a build cleanup. This ensures that pods get cleaned up even if they are in an Unknown or Not-Ready state. (CI-5377)
- Changed the "exit x" button that appears when creating a connector to make it more visible. (CI-5323)
- Added a validation to ensure that a user provides a repo name when setting up a trigger with an account-level Git connector. Without this validation, the UI would allow users to click Save without a repo name but the trigger would not get created. (CI-5315)
- Improved the error message that appears when a connection test fails because an account-level resource is trying to use a project-level secret. (CI-4705)
- Fixed an issue in the Run Tests step that could cause a manual build to fail if a Git branch was not specified. (CI-4581)

- Fixed issue: Git provider url placeholders were incorrect. (CI-3991)
- Fixed Issue: Active Committers should not count cron and manual execution. (CI-4881)
- You will now see the "CI Codebase" input form only if the selected stage has "cloneCodebase" set as true (in case of a selective stage execution) or at least one stage in the pipeline has "cloneCodebase" set as true (in case of complete pipeline execution). (CI-4894)
- Steps inside Step Groups are now being renamed to <step*group_id>*<step_id>. (CI-5002)
- Fixed JFrog Artifactory Artifact publishing so that build/ and libs/ folders are not included in the artifactory path target. (CI-5023, ZD-32723)
- Parallelism fix: For classnames, testsuites, and testcases, you need to provide a file that includes these values. The test splitter will use these values rather than the glob result. (CI-5049)
- Fixed an intermittent issue where an OAuth error message would appear when new users tried to set up a hosted build. (CI-5060)
- Fixed Issue: Active Committers should not count cron and manual execution. (CI-4841)
- This release introduces validations for Custom Webhook events. The event handler now provides appropriate error messages if an event has incorrect values. (CI-4300)
- Logs were creating issues with multiple stages (CI, CD) and stage names which are prefixes of one another. (CI-5038, ZD-32651)

## August 2, 2022, version 76030
