## Latest: Version 6100

<!-- Oct 9 2023 -->

### New features and enhancements

When you [enable Test Intelligence](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/run-tests/set-up-test-intelligence) for Scala or Kotlin, the **Packages** and **Test Annotations** fields are now available in the Visual editor. (CI-9589)

### Early access features

This release does not include early access features.

### Fixed issues

* Fixed an issue with identifiers assigned to steps in [matrix looping strategies](/docs/platform/pipelines/looping-strategies/looping-strategies-matrix-repeat-and-parallelism) that occurred if your account was configured to use **Matrix Labels by Name** *and* the pipeline contained nested matrix strategies. This issue produced a Null Pointer Exception error. (CI-9680)
* In Kubernetes cluster build infrastructures, non-existent or unresolvable secrets are now handled in the same way as they are in VM and Harness Cloud build infrastructures. (CI-9677, ZD-50868, ZD-50901)
<!-- CI-9747: Not for RN. CI-9688: In Hotfix 5802. -->

## Previous releases

<details>
<summary>2023 releases</summary>

#### Version 5902

<!-- sept 29 2023 -->

##### New features and enhancements

[Test Intelligence](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/run-tests/set-up-test-intelligence) now supports manual branch builds (the **Git Branch** build type). This is in addition to existing support for manual PR builds, as well as PR and push webhook triggers. When you [enable Test Intelligence](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/run-tests/set-up-test-intelligence#enable-test-intelligence), you can use a manual branch build to [Generate the initial call graph](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/run-tests/set-up-test-intelligence#generate-the-initial-call-graph), and for subsequent pipeline runs. (CI-8932)

<!-- ![](./static/ci-8932.png) -->

<docimage path={require('./static/ci-8932.png')} />


##### Early access features

When [Troubleshooting with AIDA](/docs/continuous-integration/troubleshoot-ci/aida), stage-level error analysis is available for failed stages without steps. If a stage has steps, step-level error analysis occurs instead. The Harness AI Development Assistant (AIDA:tm:) for CI is a beta feature that is behind the feature flag `CI_AI_ENHANCED_REMEDIATIONS`. (CI-9102)

##### Fixed issues

* To avoid conflicts with user-provided loggers for .NET builds, Harness installs and injects the default logger only if a logger is not specified in the [Run Tests step's Build Arguments](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/run-tests/set-up-test-intelligence#build-arguments). (CI-9240)
* Fixed an issue with UI rendering of error messages related to Test Intelligence call graph visualizations. (CI-9198)
* Fixed two issues related to [runtime input](/docs/platform/variables-and-expressions/runtime-inputs#runtime-inputs) (`<+input>`) with [Cache Intelligence](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/caching-ci-data/cache-intelligence). (CI-9177)
   * Previously, if you used runtime input for [custom cache paths](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/caching-ci-data/cache-intelligence#customize-cache-paths), Harness wouldn't prompt for your input and, instead, ran the pipeline with an empty path. Now, Harness correctly prompts you for this input when you run the pipeline.
   * Previously, if you used runtime input for [custom cache keys](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/caching-ci-data/cache-intelligence#customize-cache-keys), you couldn't save the pipeline due to an improper schema validation error. This is fixed.
* If a step used [runtime input for conditional execution settings](/docs/platform/pipelines/w_pipeline-steps-reference/step-skip-condition-settings/#conditional-execution-as-a-runtime-input), but no runtime input was provided at pipeline runtime, then the pipeline passed the literal string `<+input>` instead of an empty object. This is fixed. <!-- not delegate dependent --> (CI-9428, ZD-50027)
* Fixed an issue where build pods weren't cleaned up if Harness selected an invalid delegate for the cleanup task. This could happen if you used [delegate selectors](/docs/platform/Delegates/manage-delegates/select-delegates-with-selectors) based on [delegate tags](/docs/platform/Delegates/manage-delegates/select-delegates-with-selectors#delegate-tags), and multiple delegates had the same tags, but some of those delegates didn't have access to the cluster. Now Harness checks the selected delegate's connectivity to the cluster before assigning a task to that delegate. This item requires Harness Delegate version 23.09.80804. For information about features that require a specific delegate version, go to the [Delegate release notes](/release-notes/delegate). <!-- The CI change was in 5801 but required delegate 807xx, which there was none, so the delegate portion is in 808xx --> (CI-8831, ZD-47647)

##### Hotfixes

This release does not include hotfixes.

#### Version 5801

<!-- sept 19 2023 -->
##### New features and enhancements

* You can now use the [Upload Artifacts to S3 step](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/build-and-upload-artifacts/upload-artifacts-to-s-3-step-settings) with buckets with [disabled ACLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html). (CI-8371, ZD-45677)

##### Early access features

This release does not include early access features.

##### Fixed issues

* Fixed an issue where step-level [matrix looping strategies](/docs/platform/pipelines/looping-strategies/looping-strategies-matrix-repeat-and-parallelism) failed due to a mismatch in step identifiers. (CI-9325, ZD-49594, ZD-50209)
* When adding [Environment Variables for Run steps](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/run-ci-scripts/run-step-settings#environment-variables), the Visual Editor now allows empty values. This matches existing functionality in the YAML editor where you can use empty quotes to specify an empty value, such as `VAR_NAME: ''`. (CI-9148)
* Fixed two issues in the Get Started workflow: (CI-9147)
   * Removed a redundant field validation for **Branch**, which is not required if you deselect **Store in Git**.
   * **Pipeline Name** is no longer ignored. Previously, pipelines were named `Build REPO_NAME`, regardless of what you entered in **Pipeline Name**.

##### Hotfixes

* **Version 5802:** Fixed an issue where build pods weren't cleaned up after the build finished. This was due to the cleanup task targeting pods to cleanup by pod IP address. In scenarios where a pod creation request fails, there is no pod IP available for the cleanup task to target. Now, the cleanup task can use pod names or IP addresses. (CI-9699, CI-9688, ZD-51016, ZD-51035, ZD-51064) <!-- sept 22 2023 -->
* **Version 5803:** Addressed an issue related to [Cache Intelligence in parallel stages](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/caching-ci-data/cache-intelligence#cache-intelligence-in-parallel-stages). <!-- sept 28 2023 -->

#### Version 5602

<!-- sept 12 2023 -->
##### New features and enhancements

This release does not include new features or enhancements.

##### Early access features

This release does not include early access features.

##### Fixed issues

* Pipelines failed due to a 409 error that occurs if multiple [BuildKit](https://docs.docker.com/build/buildkit) instances attempt to create the same file in a GCP bucket, such as with the [Save Cache to GCS step](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/caching-ci-data/save-cache-in-gcs). Now, such errors are ignored when exporting a cache. At the point in a pipeline when a cache is saved, the image is already built and pushed, and errors, such as this 409 error, should not prevent saving the cache. (CI-9323, ZD-49698)
* Removed the `DRONE_WORKSPACE` environment variable from the local runner build infrastructure because it overwrote the working directory. This variable is equivalent to [`HARNESS_WORKSPACE`](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/optimize-and-more/ci-env-var/#harness_workspace), which doesn't incorrectly overwrite the working directory. (CI-9303)
* Upgraded `io.netty:netty*` to version `4.1.94.final` to address vulnerabilities. This item requires Harness Delegate version 23.09.80505. For information about features that require a specific delegate version, go to the [Delegate release notes](/release-notes/delegate). (CI-8971, ZD-48488)

##### Hotfixes

This release does not include hotfixes.

#### Version 5504

<!-- sept 7 2023 -->
##### New features and enhancements

This release does not include new features or enhancements.

##### Early access features

This release does not include early access features.

##### Fixed issues

* [Git event webhook triggers](/docs/platform/Triggers/triggering-pipelines) based on GitHub Issue comments failed if the [GitHub connector](/docs/platform/connectors/code-repositories/ref-source-repo-provider/git-hub-connector-settings-reference) connected through the Harness Platform and the account had no delegates. Despite the connector not requiring a delegate, the trigger still failed. This has been fixed. (CI-9150)

##### Hotfixes

This release does not include hotfixes.

#### August 26, 2023, version 5408

##### New features and enhancements

* You can use GitHub connectors with [GitHub App authentication](/docs/platform/connectors/code-repositories/ref-source-repo-provider/git-hub-connector-settings-reference#credentials-settings) in the [Git Clone step](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/codebase-configuration/clone-and-process-multiple-codebases-in-the-same-pipeline). (CI-8367)
* Improved support for `DRONE_` environment variables in CI pipelines. This improves compatibility for [plugins](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/use-drone-plugins/explore-ci-plugins) and makes it easier to migrate from standalone Drone to Harness CI. (CI-7600)

<!-- /docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/optimize-and-more/ci-env-var-->

##### Early access features

**GitHub App authentication for GitHub connectors (CI-8577)**

This feature is behind the feature flag `CDS_GITHUB_APP_AUTHENTICATION` and it requires Harness Delegate version 23.08.80308 or later. Contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io) to enable the feature flag. For information about features and fixes requiring a specific delegate version, go to the [delegate release notes](/release-notes/delegate).

With this feature flag enabled, you can use a GitHub App as the [primary authentication method for a GitHub connector](/docs/platform/connectors/code-repositories/ref-source-repo-provider/git-hub-connector-settings-reference#credentials-settings).

##### Fixed issues

* Improved the way [Test Intelligence](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/run-tests/set-up-test-intelligence) handles tests that call more tests. Previously, this rarely caused inaccurate renderings in the call graph visualization for Java-based tests. (CI-9053)
* Fixed an issue where, if you selected runtime input for the codebase connector and repository name in a pipeline template, these settings reverted to fixed values after saving any other change to the template. (CI-8885, ZD-47680, ZD-47744)
* You can now use [expressions](/docs/platform/Variables-and-Expressions/harness-variables), such as those for [matrix strategies](/docs/platform/pipelines/looping-strategies/looping-strategies-matrix-repeat-and-parallelism#matrix-strategies), in [build infrastructure `platform` settings](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/set-up-build-infrastructure/ci-stage-settings#infrastructure) when working in the YAML editor. (CI-6830)
* Removed unnecessary wait time at the end of the initialize step, saving approximately 30 seconds. This fix requires Harness Delegate version 803xx or later. For information about features and fixes requiring a specific delegate version, go to the [delegate release notes](/release-notes/delegate). (CI-9122)
* Fixed an issue where some secrets were not masked as expected in logs. (CI-8134)
* [Webhook triggers](/docs/platform/triggers/triggering-pipelines/) now reattempt calls to SCM APIs if the connection was reset or there was a server-side error. This fixes an issue where intermittent outages in connections to SCM APIs failed to trigger builds. (CI-8904, ZD-47605)
* Filtering the [build list](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/viewing-builds) by **Build Type: Branch** now correctly excludes PR builds. (CI-9322, ZD-48837, ZD-49619)

##### Hotfixes

This release does not include hotfixes.

#### August 10, 2023, version 5301

##### What's new

* Improved the consistency of [built-in codebase expression](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/codebase-configuration/built-in-cie-codebase-variables-reference) values across build types. You can now expect similar values for these expressions regardless of build type. For example, `<+codebase.commitRef>` now provides a consistent reference for the build, such as `refs/heads/BRANCH_NAME` for a branch build or `refs/tags/TAG_NAME` for a tag build. (CI-7689)

##### Early access

* Enable and configure Cache Intelligence in the Visual editor. (CI-8917)
   * The Cache Intelligence visual editor fields are behind the feature flag `CI_CACHE_INTELLIGENCE`. Contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io) to enable the feature.
   * You can enable and configure [Cache Intelligence](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/caching-ci-data/cache-intelligence) in the Pipeline Studio's Visual editor. Previously, you could only enable Cache Intelligence through the YAML editor. For more information, go to the [Cache Intelligence](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/caching-ci-data/cache-intelligence) documentation. This enhancement only applies to Harness Cloud build infrastructure.

<!-- this change added the key and paths fields to the UI -->

##### Fixed issues

* The **Copy** button is now available when editing input sets in the YAML editor. (CI-8199)

#### August 7, 2023, version 5200

##### What's new

This release does not include new features.

##### Early access

This release does not include early access features.

##### Fixed issues

* Fixed an issue that caused [Cache Intelligence](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/caching-ci-data/cache-intelligence) to be incompatible with Maven 3.9. (CI-8891)
* Fixed pagination for [license usage](/docs/continuous-integration/get-started/ci-subscription-mgmt#license-usage) tables. (CI-8857)
* If a build started by a [PR webhook](/docs/platform/Triggers/triggering-pipelines) fails, you can manually rerun the build. However, previously, the manual rerun could also fail due to a missing `DRONE_COMMIT_REF` environment variable. Now, this has been fixed, and the expected variable is included in case of manual reruns. (CI-8794, ZD-47417)
* Fixed an issue with handling of new line characters in [GitHub App private key files](/docs/platform/connectors/code-repositories/git-hub-app-support) generated on Windows machines. This fix requires Harness Delegate version 23.08.80104 or later. For information about features and fixes requiring a specific delegate version, go to the [delegate release notes](/release-notes/delegate). (CI-8708)

#### July 28, 2023, version 5106

##### What's new

* **Eliminate unnecessary connection tests for GitHub connectors. (CI-7902, ZD-43391)**
   * Harness regularly runs automatic connection tests for your GitHub connectors. Previously, Harness would continue to run these tests even if the tests were failing repeatedly. Now, if the connection test fails due to an authorization issues with GitHub credentials, Harness stops checking the connector until you update the connectors's credentials. This eliminates unnecessary testing that could cause LDAP user accounts in AD to become locked, due to excessive failed access attempts, if a connector's personal access token was associated with a specific user's account.
   * To restart the connection tests, you must edit the [GitHub connector settings](/docs/platform/connectors/code-repositories/ref-source-repo-provider/git-hub-connector-settings-reference) to add new credentials or trigger a connection test with existing, reinstated credentials. Updating the connector settings triggers a connection test, and, if this connection test succeeds, Harness resumes regular testing.
* **Build status links on Azure Repos PRs. (CI-8356, ZD-45085)**
   * Builds triggered by PRs in Azure Repos now include a **Details** link in the PR that you can follow to the [Build details page](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/viewing-builds#source-code-repository-links) in Harness.
* **Upload artifacts to Sonatype Nexus.**
   * You can use the **Nexus Publish** Drone plugin to [upload artifacts to Sonatype Nexus](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/build-and-upload-artifacts/upload-artifacts-to-sonatype-nexus).

##### Early access

* Enable Cache Intelligence in the Visual editor. (CI-8571)
   * The **Enable Cache Intelligence** UI field is behind the feature flag `CI_CACHE_INTELLIGENCE`. Contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io) to enable the feature.
   * You can enable [Cache Intelligence](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/caching-ci-data/cache-intelligence) in the Pipeline Studio's Visual editor. Previously, you could only enable Cache Intelligence through the YAML editor. For more information, go to the [Cache Intelligence](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/caching-ci-data/cache-intelligence) documentation. This enhancement only applies to Harness Cloud build infrastructure.

##### Fixed issues

* Fixed an issue where the active developer count was not reported for builds triggered by cron jobs, custom webhooks, and other triggers. (CI-8502, ZD-46409)
* Fixed an issue where step details for other steps were shown when using [AIDA](/docs/continuous-integration/troubleshoot-ci/aida) to troubleshoot a pipeline with multiple failed steps. (CI-8735)

#### July 18, 2023, version 5003

##### What's new

This release does not include new features.

##### Early access

The `CI_LE_STATUS_REST_ENABLED` feature has been rolled back to early access and disabled by default due to a discovered instability that caused the [CD Container step](/docs/continuous-delivery/x-platform-cd-features/cd-steps/utilities/container-step) to fail. This feature causes CI steps to send status updates to the [Harness Manager](/docs/get-started/harness-platform-architecture#harness-platform-components) directly by HTTP, rather than through a delegate.

This feature flag is now disabled by default and must be re-enabled if your CI-to-Harness-Manager communications need to support client connections with additional certificates. (CI-8338)

##### Fixed issues

* [Test Intelligence](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/run-tests/set-up-test-intelligence) now reads packages from files for all changed files, instead of relying on the file path to determine the package. This fixes an issue where tests were missed due to the test package not following the order of folders, because Test Intelligence previously determined the package from the class path. (CI-8692)

* The `CI_LE_STATUS_REST_ENABLED` feature has been rolled back to early access due to a discovered instability that caused the [CD Container step](/docs/continuous-delivery/x-platform-cd-features/cd-steps/utilities/container-step) to fail. This feature causes CI steps to send status updates to the [Harness Manager](/docs/get-started/harness-platform-architecture#harness-platform-components) directly by HTTP, rather than through a delegate. This feature flag is now disabled by default and must be re-enabled if your CI-to-Harness-Manager communications need to support client connections with additional certificates. (CI-8338)


#### July 06, 2023, version 4901

##### What's new

This release does not include new features.

##### Early access

This release does not include early access features.

##### Fixed issues

* Applied scrolling to long remediation messages when [troubleshooting with AIDA](/docs/continuous-integration/troubleshoot-ci/aida). (CI-8599)
* The [Builds page](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/viewing-builds) now shows the correct user's avatar for manual builds. For scheduled builds, it now shows the schedule trigger name, instead of the latest commit author's name. (CI-8531, ZD-46409)
* If you chose to [run a specific stage](/docs/platform/pipelines/run-specific-stage-in-pipeline/) in a pipeline that had multiple stage types (such as UAT, Build/CI, CD, and so on), and you bypassed a Build stage, then the pipeline could fail due to a backend value being set to an empty string, rather than an object. This is fixed so that this backend value is always an object, even when empty. (CI-8418, ZD-45768)

#### June 28, 2023, version 4301

##### What's new

This release does not include new features.

##### Early access

This release does not include early access features.

##### Fixed issues

* Fixed an issue where Artifactory connector credentials weren't correctly passed to [Upload Artifacts to JFrog Artifactory steps](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/build-and-upload-artifacts/upload-artifacts-to-jfrog) in nested [step groups](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/optimize-and-more/group-ci-steps-using-step-groups). (CI-8351, ZD-45611)
* BitBucket Cloud limits the key size for sending status updates to PRs, and this can cause incorrect status updates in PRs due to some statuses failing to send. If you encounter this issue with BitBucket Cloud, contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io) to troubleshoot this issue by enabling a feature flag, `CI_BITBUCKET_STATUS_KEY_HASH`. (CI-8302, ZD-45441)
* Artifacts produced by **Build and push** steps inside a [matrix looping strategy](/docs/platform/pipelines/looping-strategies/looping-strategies-matrix-repeat-and-parallelism) now appear on the **Artifacts** tab on the [Build details page](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/viewing-builds). (CI-7970)
* When configuring a [Background step](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/manage-dependencies/background-step-settings), the **Entry Point** field is now located under **Additional Configuration** if the stage uses the Harness Cloud, local runner, or self-hosted VM build infrastructure. (CI-6993)
* When creating a step template, the labels for **Configure Run Tests step** and **Configure Run step** have been shorted to **Run Tests** and **Run** respectively. This change follows labeling conventions used elsewhere in Harness CI. (CI-4771)

#### June 19, 2023, version 4204

##### What's new

The Harness Cloud Linux amd64 image has new major and minor versions for multiple components. Major version upgrades are described below. For a complete list of component versions, go to the [Harness Cloud image specifications](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/set-up-build-infrastructure/use-harness-cloud-build-infrastructure/#platforms-and-image-specifications). (CI-7537)

:::caution

If you have pipelines running on Harness Cloud that rely on specific component versions, you might need to [lock versions or install additional tools](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/set-up-build-infrastructure/use-harness-cloud-build-infrastructure/#lock-versions-or-install-additional-tools) to prevent your pipeline from failing due to image changes.

</details>

##### Early access

* **Output variables automatically become environment variables (CI-7817, ZD-39203)**
  * Output variables from steps can be available as environment variables for other steps in the same Build (`CI`) stage. This functionality is behind a feature flag, `CI_OUTPUT_VARIABLES_AS_ENV`.
  * This means that, if you have a Build stage with three steps, an output variable produced from step one is automatically available as an environment variable for steps two and three. In other steps in the same stage, you can refer to the output variable by its key without additional identification. For example, an output variable called `MY_VAR` can be referenced later as simply `$MY_VAR`. Without this feature flag enabled, you must use an [expression](/docs/platform/variables-and-expressions/runtime-inputs/#expressions) to reference where the variable originated, such as `<+steps.stepID.output.outputVariables.MY_VAR>`.
  * For more information on this feature, go to the documentation on [Output variables](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/run-ci-scripts/run-step-settings#output-variables).
* **Remote debugging enhancements (CI-8135, CI-8048)**
  * **Re-run in Debug Mode** now supports Python and PowerShell Core (`pwsh`). You can also now use debug mode for local runner build infrastructures. The remote debugging functionality is behind a feature flag, `CI_REMOTE_DEBUG`. For more information, go to [Debug with SSH](/docs/continuous-integration/troubleshoot-ci/debug-mode).

##### Fixed issues

* Improved error messages for [Run steps](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/run-ci-scripts/run-step-settings) using [AWS connectors](/docs/platform/connectors/cloud-providers/add-aws-connector) with invalid credentials in [VM build infrastructures](/docs/category/set-up-vm-build-infrastructures). (CI-7942, ZD-44039)
* Fixed an issue where the active developer count was not reported for builds triggered manually. (CI-8025)
* Fixed an issue related to logs for Background steps. (CI-7615, ZD-44501)

##### Hotfix versions 4205, 4206

Released June 22, 2023 - These hotfixes addressed regressions that caused existing pipelines to fail.

#### June 12, 2023, version 4006

##### What's new

This release does not include new features.

##### Early access

This release does not include early access features.

##### Fixed issues

Fixed an issue where Git status updates failed if the Azure repository/project name had white space. Harness now decodes white spaces in URLs so the Git status update request can succeed. The [Harness Delegate version 23.06.79503 or later](/release-notes/delegate) is required for this fix. (CI-8105, ZD-44679)

#### June 01, 2023, version 3903

##### What's new

This release does not include new features.

##### Early access

This release does not include early access features.

##### Fixed issues

* Previously, in situations where a build pod wasn't created, an error occurred when the cleanup event couldn't find details of a pod to cleanup. Now, handling has been added to avoid this error. (CI-8065)
* Fixed an issue where running multiple [Build and Push to Docker steps](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/build-and-upload-artifacts/build-and-push-to-docker-hub-step-settings) in [parallel](/docs/platform/pipelines/looping-strategies/looping-strategies-matrix-repeat-and-parallelism) could result in multiple copies of the same image being pushed to the Docker repository. While the image names were different, the underlying image was the same. (CI-8039)
* Fixed an issue where passing an empty runtime input value for the **Dockerfile** setting in a [Build and Push to Docker step](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/build-and-upload-artifacts/build-and-push-to-docker-hub-step-settings) didn't resolve properly. (CI-7912, ZD-43490)

##### Hotfix version 3904

This hotfix was released on June 5, 2023. This hotfix does not include customer-facing changes.

#### May 23, 2023, version 3805

Starting with the May 04, 2023 release, CI release notes use the CI Manager version number rather than the Harness Delegate version number.

##### What's new

Added support for showing artifacts on the **Artifacts** tab in Harness Cloud and VMs. (CI-7218)

Previously, this was supported only for Kubernetes builds. The artifacts are visible on the execution **Artifact** tab and the artifact details are visible on the step output window.

##### Early access

Harness CI now supports remote debugging. This feature was initially released in January 2023 and subsequently reverted for further development. Debug mode is available if all of the following conditions are met:

* You have the feature flag `CI_REMOTE_DEBUG` enabled. Contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io) to enable this feature.
* The build infrastructure uses a Linux-based OS.
* The build fails at a **Run** step with a Bash or Shell script in a **Build** (`CI`) stage.
* The build runs in Harness Cloud, on a virtual machine, or in Kubernetes.

You can re-run builds in debug mode through the **Builds**, **Execution**, and **Execution History** pages of the Harness UI. For more information, go to the [debug mode](/docs/continuous-integration/troubleshoot-ci/debug-mode) documentation.

##### Fixed issues

* Fixed the [license usage](/docs/continuous-integration/get-started/ci-subscription-mgmt) sort function. (CI-7945)
* [Cache Intelligence](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/caching-ci-data/cache-intelligence) now supports caching subdirectory builds. (CI-7853)
* In step templates for **Run**, **Run Tests**, and **Background** steps, the `connectorRef` and `image` settings are now optional because these settings are not required for all build infrastructures. Validations are triggered when you use these templates in a pipeline that requires these settings. (CI-7845)
* Previously, test splitting wouldn't work with step-level parallelism on a Kubernetes cluster build infrastructure due to the way certain environment variables were read. This is fixed. (CI-7800, CI-7803, ZD-43259, ZD-43272)
* If you run a pipeline that uses a Kubernetes cluster build infrastructure and step templates with empty `connectorRef` and `image` values, the resulting error message is more accurate and informative. (CI-7785)
* When manually running a pipeline, you can chose to run specific stages, rather than the entire pipeline. Previously, if you chose to run only stages with **Clone Codebase** disabled, you were blocked by a field validation error requiring you to populate the **Git Branch** and **Repository** fields, which weren't visible. This has been fixed so that you are only asked to provide codebase information if **Clone Codebase** is enabled for at least one of the selected stages. (CI-7559, CI-7934 ZD-41974, ZD-43980, ZD-44041)
* If the GitLab SCM URL is of the form of anything other than `https://<domain>/project/repo.git`, then the API access fails for the connector. To fix this, a new field called `apiUrl` was added to the connector YAML. You can specify the new field to be used for all API requests. (CI-7838)

#### May 04, 2023, version 3506

Starting with this release, CI release notes use the CI Manager version number rather than the Harness Delegate version number.

##### What's new

* The CI Getting Started workflow now saves the pipeline remotely (in your Git repository) by default. Previously, the pipeline was stored inline (in Harness) unless you manually selected remote storage. The Getting Started workflow also automatically creates two [input sets](/docs/platform/pipelines/input-sets/) for [Git event triggers](/docs/platform/Triggers/triggering-pipelines): one for a PR trigger and one for a Push trigger. (CI-7602)
* You can now reference [output variables produced by Plugin steps](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/use-drone-plugins/plugin-step-settings-reference#output-variables) in pipelines that use Kubernetes cluster build infrastructures. This is an addition to previously-existing support for Harness Cloud and self-hosted Cloud provider VM build infrastructures. (CI-7491)
* [Local runner](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/set-up-build-infrastructure/define-a-docker-build-infrastructure) and [Kubernetes cluster](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/set-up-build-infrastructure/k8s-build-infrastructure/set-up-a-kubernetes-cluster-build-infrastructure) build infrastructures now support pipeline- and stage-level [delegate selectors](/docs/platform/Delegates/manage-delegates/select-delegates-with-selectors). You can use pipeline and stage-level delegate selectors to override the platform or connector delegate. This level of delegate selection isn't supported for Harness Cloud or self-hosted Cloud provider VM build infrastructures. (CI-6237)

##### Early access

This release does not include early access features.

##### Fixed issues

* Fixed an issue where the [SSL Verify setting](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/codebase-configuration/clone-and-process-multiple-codebases-in-the-same-pipeline#ssl-verify) in the **Git Clone** step always treated the value as false. (CI-7721, ZD-42483)

#### April 22, 2023, version 79111

##### What's new

* The CI Getting Started workflow leads you through creating an SCM connector and a pipeline. This workflow has been improved to generate a pipeline based on the repository you select. (CI-7603)
* The **Run as User** setting is now available for [Run steps](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/run-ci-scripts/run-step-settings), [Run Tests steps](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/run-tests/set-up-test-intelligence#add-the-run-tests-step), and [Plugin steps](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/use-drone-plugins/plugin-step-settings-reference) in stages that use [Harness Cloud build infrastructure](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/set-up-build-infrastructure/use-harness-cloud-build-infrastructure). This setting allows you to specify a user ID to use for processes running in containerized steps. (CI-7493)
* Added validations for pipelines that use the [Harness Cloud](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/set-up-build-infrastructure/use-harness-cloud-build-infrastructure) macOS build infrastructure, which doesn't support containerized steps. The new validations produce an error message if any applicable steps, such as [Run steps](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/run-ci-scripts/run-step-settings), have the **Image** and either **Container Registry** or **Connector** fields populated. (CI-7221)

##### Early access

This release does not include early access features.

##### Fixed issues

* Build statuses are now updated as expected in BitBucket if the [BitBucket connector's Authentication settings](/docs/platform/connectors/code-repositories/ref-source-repo-provider/bitbucket-connector-settings-reference/#authentication) use a text secret for the **Username**. (CI-7576, ZD-41969)
* Fixed an issue where looping strategies were not working for some steps. (CI-7499, ZD-41659)
* When you [create a step template](/docs/continuous-delivery/x-platform-cd-features/templates/create-a-remote-step-template) for a [Run step](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/run-ci-scripts/run-step-settings), the **Container Registry** and **Image** fields are now optional because these fields are not required for all build infrastructures. (CI-7594, ZD-42131, ZD-43027)
* Fixed an issue where [GCP connectors](/docs/platform/connectors/cloud-providers/connect-to-google-cloud-platform-gcp/) that inherit credentials from a Delegate were erroneously reporting failed connection tests. (CI-7538)

#### April 10, 2023, version 79015

##### What's new

* Your CI pipelines can automatically update Jira issues when builds and deployments occur. For more information, go to [Explore plugins](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/use-drone-plugins/explore-ci-plugins). (CI-7222)
* The following features are now generally available. These were enabled by default for all users, but they were behind features flags until they were deemed stable. (CI-6537)
  * `CI_LE_STATUS_REST_ENABLED`: All CI steps send status updates to the [Harness Manager](/docs/get-started/harness-platform-architecture#harness-platform-components) directly by HTTP rather than through a Delegate.
  * `CI_DISABLE_GIT_SAFEDIR`: To facilitate `git config` operations, [Run](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/run-ci-scripts/run-step-settings) and [Run Tests](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/run-tests/set-up-test-intelligence#add-the-run-tests-step) steps automatically run a [Git safe.directory](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-safedirectory) script.

##### Early access

This release does not include early access features.

##### Fixed issues

* You can now successfully use [references to secrets in non-Harness Secret Managers](/docs/platform/secrets/secrets-management/reference-existing-secret-manager-secrets) in CI pipelines. Previously, these references failed because CI handles secrets as environment variables and some characters in these types of secret references aren't supported for environment variables. Now, CI automatically replaces unsupported characters with supported ones so it can process these references as environment variables. (CI-7443, ZD-41124)
* In the Get Started wizard, selecting **Learn more about Harness CI** now only scrolls the body of the screen, rather than the entire UI. (CI-7522)
* When creating a [stage template](/docs/platform/templates/add-a-stage-template), the UI no longer crashes if you select the [expression input type](/docs/platform/variables-and-expressions/runtime-inputs) for the **Shell** field in a **Run** step. (CI-7510)
* Fixed a minor UI issue where selecting the **Commits** tab on the [Build details page](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/viewing-builds) caused the navigation menu to expand. (CI-6274)

#### March 31, 2023, version 78914

##### What's new

* When you [use a GitHub App in a GitHub connector](/docs/platform/connectors/code-repositories/git-hub-app-support), you can now use encrypted text secrets for the **Installation ID** and **Application ID**. (CI-7380)
* Added a [codebase expression](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/codebase-configuration/built-in-cie-codebase-variables-reference) for commit messages: `<+codebase.commitMessage>`. (CI-7222)

##### Early access

This release does not include early access features.

##### Fixed issues

Fixed an issue related to secrets resolution in the [GitHub Action plugin step](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/use-drone-plugins/ci-github-action-step). (CI-6969, CI-7300)

#### March 24, 2023, version 78817

##### What's new

* [Cache Intelligence](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/caching-ci-data/cache-intelligence) is now generally available. With Cache Intelligence, Harness automatically caches and restores common dependencies. You don't need to bring your own storage because Harness stores the cache in the Harness-hosted environment, Harness Cloud. (CI-7127)
* [Harness Cloud](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/set-up-build-infrastructure/use-harness-cloud-build-infrastructure) build infrastructure now supports **Run as User** for [Plugin](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/use-drone-plugins/plugin-step-settings-reference) and [Run](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/run-ci-scripts/run-step-settings) steps that are running on containers. (CI-7320)

##### Early access

This release does not include early access features.

##### Fixed issues

* You can now use [variable expressions](/docs/platform/variables-and-expressions/runtime-inputs) for the **Shell** and **Image Pull Policy** settings. Previously, selecting the **Expression** input type for **Shell** caused a UI-breaking error, and providing an expression for **Image Pull Policy** caused a field validation error. (CI-7071, ZD-40277)
* If a CI pipeline fails at the **Initialize** step due to an [Azure Repos connector](/docs/platform/connectors/code-repositories/connect-to-a-azure-repo) having an on-premises **Azure Repos Project URL**, the error message clearly describes the root cause. This failure occurs because CI doesn't support Azure DevOps Server Repositories (also known as _on-premises Azure Repos_). (CI-6322)
* If you configure a [code repo connector](/docs/category/code-repo-connectors) where the **URL Type** is **Account**, the **Connection Test** now shows the full test repo URL, which is the URL used to test the connection, rather than the account URL. (CI-4398)
* Attempting to manually clone a PR through a Git connector that doesn't have API access enabled now returns an error message indicating that the connector doesn't have the required API access. (CI-7192)
* The deprecated Harness images warning banner no longer appears when there are no deprecated images in use. (CI-7335)

#### March 15, 2023, version 78712

##### What's new

* The [Base Image Connector setting](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/build-and-upload-artifacts/build-and-push-to-ecr-step-settings#base-image-connector) for the **Build and Push to ECR** step now supports all Docker-compliant registries. Previously, this setting only supported Docker Hub registries. (CI-7153, CI-7091, ZD-40319)
* You can now call pipeline-level variables in steps as environment variables. This is an extension of existing functionality that allows you to call stage-level variables in steps as environment variables. (CI-6709, ZD-39203)
* When configuring [SCM connectors](/docs/category/code-repo-connectors):
  * Failed connection tests now return more detailed error messages. (CI-7089)
  * The placeholder text in the **Repository URL** field shows a complete repo URL example. (CI-5750)

##### Early access

This release does not include early access features.

##### Fixed issues

* When configuring [local build infrastructure](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/set-up-build-infrastructure/define-a-docker-build-infrastructure), it was not possible to select the Windows operating system. This issue has been resolved and the Windows OS is available again. (CI-7111, ZD-40311)
* Builds no longer fail if steps in different step groups have the same `identifier`. Additionally, to prevent steps in step groups from producing artifacts with identical artifact IDs, when steps in step groups produce artifacts, the resulting artifact IDs now use a unique identifier that reflects the step's presence in a step group. (CI-7115)
* If a pipeline's [codebase clone depth](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/codebase-configuration/create-and-configure-a-codebase) was set to `0`, manually triggered builds would override this setting and clone at a depth of 50 instead. This issue did not occur for depth settings other than `0`, and it did not occur for non-manual triggers. Now, manually triggered builds won't override the depth setting when it is set to `0`. (CI-7083, ZD-40306)
* When manually triggering a build, the default repository is populated for on-prem Git connectors. (CI-6814)
* If you change a stage's build infrastructure after adding steps to the stage, field validations for step settings are now triggered as expected when building and saving pipelines. This is important for settings that are unavailable or optional with some build infrastructures but required for others. (CI-6209)
* Fixed an issue where builds triggered by issue comments had the incorrect PR status or link for some SCM providers. (CI-6978)
* Fixed several issues related to error messages on the [Build details page](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/viewing-builds#build-details):
  * If the Docker runner was down for a build using local build infrastructure, the error message now contains the correct wording corresponding with the local build infrastructure, rather than wording relevant to a Kubernetes build infrastructure. (CI-6854)
  * An `unsupported image` warning banner incorrectly appeared for builds that did not use Kubernetes build infrastructure. (CI-7098, ZD-40428)
  * The `unsupported image` warning banner no longer pushes the bottom of the log region outside the scrollable area. (CI-7098, ZD-40428)
* Unresolved stage-level and pipeline-level environment variables generated exception errors in cases where those variables were expected to receive a value at a later point in the pipeline. These variables now supplement a default (`null`) value if no initial value is available. (CI-7125)

#### February 23, 2023, version 78507

##### What's new

In addition to fixed values and runtime inputs, you can now use [expressions](/docs/platform/variables-and-expressions/runtime-inputs#expressions) for the **Repository Name** in your pipelines' input sets, triggers, and codebase configuration settings. This is useful for pipelines that you use with multiple repositories. (CI-6657, ZD-38657)

![The CI pipeline codebase configuration settings window.](static/ci-pipeline-codebase-reponame-exp.png)

##### Early access

This release does not include early access features.

##### Fixed issues

Modifying a step template's **Step Parameters** no longer removes failure strategies from the template's **Advanced** settings. (CI-6801, ZD-39108)
<!-- Alternate longer version: When you edit a step template that includes a failure strategy, modifying the template's **Step Parameters** no longer removes the **Failure Strategy** configuration from the template's **Advanced** settings. -->

#### February 15, 2023, version 78421

##### What's new

* Microsoft Windows (amd64) is now a supported [Harness Cloud](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/set-up-build-infrastructure/use-harness-cloud-build-infrastructure) build infrastructure option. (CI-5455)
* **Python** is now available as a built-in **Shell** option for [Run steps](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/run-ci-scripts/run-step-settings). (CI-6692)
* [Run steps](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/run-ci-scripts/run-step-settings) can now reference images in GCR through [GCP connectors](/docs/platform/connectors/cloud-providers/connect-to-google-cloud-platform-gcp) that use inherited credentials. (CI-5758, ZD-38986)
  * GCP connectors are authenticated through either a GCP service account key or by inheriting credentials from the Harness delegate running in GCP. This change improves how you can use GCP connectors with inherited credentials in your pipelines.
  * Previously, if you wanted a Run step to call an image in GRC, the GCP connector attached to your Run step had to use service account key authentication. Now, the GCP connector can use either authentication method.
* Use [Background steps](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/manage-dependencies/background-step-settings) to configure service dependencies. (CI-5580)
  * The Background step allows for better control and configuration of services than the now-deprecated Configure Service Dependency step.
  * Pipelines with Configure Service Dependency steps remain backwards compatible, but this step is not available for new pipelines.
  * Replace Configure Service Dependency steps with Background steps to take advantage of the more robust control and configuration option.
* [Pipeline execution status links](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/viewing-builds) in Git pull requests now direct you to the associated stage within the pipeline, rather than the pipeline as a whole. (CI-6813)
* Improved handling of Azure repo URLs in [Git webhook pipeline triggers](/docs/platform/triggers/triggering-pipelines). (CI-5720)

##### Early access

This release does not include early access features.

##### Deprecations

The Configure Service Dependency step is deprecated in favor of the [Background step](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/manage-dependencies/background-step-settings), which allows for better control and configuration of services. Pipelines with Configure Service Dependency steps remain backwards compatible, but this step is not available for new pipelines. Replace Configure Service Dependency steps with Background steps to take advantage of the more robust control and configuration options. (CI-5580)

##### Fixed issues

* With the feature flag `NEW_LEFT_NAV_BAR` enabled, you can view build details at the project level without drilling down into individual modules. When viewing build details from the project level, the **Commits** tab produced a `404` error. This is fixed. (CI-6817)
* Expressions used in pipeline codebase properties unexpectedly resolved to `null`, which caused builds to fail due to missing variable input. These expressions now resolve to their expected values. (CI-6679, ZD-38122, ZD-38241, ZD-38698, ZD-39088)

   ![The CI Codebase Configuration window with the fields set to accept variable expression input.](static/ci-codebase-config-exp-values.png)

* The CI Getting Started workflow leads you through creating an SCM connector and a pipeline. Previously, exiting the Getting Started workflow before creating a pipeline resulted in incomplete connector configuration, and attempting to use the incomplete connector in a pipeline produced the following error: `Invalid argument(s): Both plain text and secret value cannot be null for the field`. If you encounter this error, replace the pipeline's SCM connector with a new one. (CI-6443)

#### February 6, 2023, version 78321

##### What's new

* Linux ARM is now supported in [Harness Cloud](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/set-up-build-infrastructure/use-harness-cloud-build-infrastructure) build infrastructures. (CI-5787)
* The Harness UI now shows a detailed warning when a CI build uses unsupported versions of any CI build images. (CI-6721)

##### Early access features

This release does not include early access features.

##### Fixed issues

* Improved the error message that appears in the UI when a Git test connection fails. (CI-6889)
* Fixed an issue where feature flags would sometimes not work with CI due to a backwards-compatibility issue. (CI-6687)
* Fixed an issue where the Commits tab would show a 404 error in the CD build UI. (CI-6632)

#### January 17, 2023, version 78215

##### What's new

* This release includes two new CI steps for integrating your Harness CI pipelines with GitHub Actions and Bitrise. The following steps are available in Harness Cloud build infrastructures only.
   - An Actions step to run GitHub Actions.
   - A Bitrise step to run Bitrise steps and workflows. (CI-6479)
* *The remote debugging feature announced in this release was reverted due to a security concern.* (CI-6350)
* You can now specify hostnames instead of IPs in Kubernetes build infrastructures. This enables your pipelines to communicate with external services using hostnames. The following Harness YAML snippet shows how to set up aliases for your cluster in the CI stage **Infrastructure** section. (CI-5996, ZD-36578)

##### Defining hostnames to use in a Kubernetes build infrastructure

``` yaml
infrastructure:
    type: KubernetesDirect
    spec:
      connectorRef: account.test
      namespace: harness-delegate
    hostNames:
      - abc.com
      - xyz.com
```

#### January 10, 2023, version 78105

##### What's new

This release does not include new features.

##### Early access features

This release does not include early access features.

##### Fixed issues

* Fixed an issue in the onboarding UI. In some cases, the web UI did not connect with the specified git account immediately after OAuth setup. (CI-6518)
* You can now use codebase fields as expressions. Previously, when the codebase repository name was defined by `<+pipeline.name>`, the built-in variables `<+codebase.branch>` and `<+codebase.commitSha>` returned null. (CI-6478, ZD-38122, ZD-38241)
* Fixed an issue that prevented Azure connectors from connecting to repos with URLs that contained spaces or `%20`. (CI-6465)
* Fixed an issue where CI reported an upload to an S3 as successful even if the upload failed. (CI-6420, ZD-37931)
* Fixed an issue in the onboarding UI where the **Select Your Repository** progress bar was incorrect. (CI-6335)
* Fixed an issue where a build did not run when a user selected **Run** in the **Pipeline Editor** UI. To run the build, the user needed to go to the YAML editor, save, and then run. (CI-6239)
* Added a log entry when a CI step skips a directory when uploading to an S3 bucket. (CI-6205)

#### December 13, 2022, version 77808

##### What's new

This release does not include new features.

##### Early access features

This release does not include early access features.

##### Fixed issues

- Recently, Harness added a new background step to allow CI users to easily set service dependencies instead of using the stage setting for service dependencies. However, since the feature flag stage still relies on the stage service dependencies, this capability was added back to the UI with this fix. (CI-6308)
- An unnecessary view appeared momentarily in the new CI Get Started flow. This issue has been fixed. (CI-6103)
- Previously, users were unable to apply changes after updating the Language field in the Configure Run Tests Step because the Build Tool and Arguments fields were required. The Build Tool and Arguments can now be set dynamically using inputs, allowing users to add and edit the Configure Run Tests Step and save it as a template. (CI-4868)

This issue has been fixed. The artifact now appears on the Artifacts tab.

##### Miscellaneous updates

The number of parallel step executions with matrix are now limited on the free plan. (CI-6061)

#### November 6, 2022, version 77317

##### What's new

The Custom Git Connector now supports connection via the Harness Platform, in addition to the ability to connect through the Harness Delegate. Connecting through Harness Secrets Manager is required to use the generic git connector on the Harness Cloud build infrastructure hosted by Harness. (CI-5666)

- Empty trigger data for non-CI pipelines does not show a message. (CI-5879)
  A static message now appears for CD manual executions.

- A file artifact URL does not show for artifact type File. (CI-5872)
  A colon (:) appears instead of the file artifact URL.
  This issue has been fixed.

- Unable to run the Google Cloud Function Drone plugin (CI-5869)
  The issue occurs because unexpected \_uuid elements were being added to the settings.
  To resolve this issue, the \_uuid attribute was removed from the nested setting attribute in the CI plugin step type.

- Intermittent issue in which a hosted build cannot fetch a code repo due to an internal exception. (CI-5622)
  This issue has been fixed.
