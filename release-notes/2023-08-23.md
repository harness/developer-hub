#### Feature Management Console 
##### Feature Flag Editor Enhancements 
The feature flag definitions tab has added two minor UX updates to the editor flow. The treatment section will now automatically collapse once a flag definition has been created/updated. Also, users will be able to view treatment information via the environment cards on the left. These enhancements help the user understand which treatments are available in their environment and guide them to the targeting section.
