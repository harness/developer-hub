##### Semantic Versioning (SemVer) Attribute Dictionary Support
Split FME now supports SemVer type attributes and suggested values in the attribute dictionary:
- Admins can create SemVer typed attribute names and suggested values.
- Users can see the SemVer attribute names and suggested values when editing targeting rules.
Attribute dictionary support reduces guesswork and manual errors when editing targeting rules.
###### **What you need to know in a nutshell:**
- The [semver](https://semver.org/) standard calls for versions to be formatted as major.minor.patch
- Split FME added [SemVer support on June 6th, 2024](https://www.split.io/releases/2024-06-06/) , eliminating the need to write regular expressions (i.e. regex) to target version ranges or "is a version less than or equal to x.y.z"
- This update adds the benefits of standardized attribute names and suggested values delivered by our Attribute Dictionary.
###### **What SemVer attribute support looks like to an admin**:
Admins can create a custom attribute of type "Semver" and optionally enter suggested values.
