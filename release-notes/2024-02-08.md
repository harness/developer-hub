#### Usability Enhancements 
##### Filtering Improvements 
To help teams quickly find the information they are looking for, Split has improved the filtering experience in these lists: feature flags, segments, and metrics. Users’ most recent search filters will be preserved as users continue to navigate the product. 
#### Feature Experimentation
##### Sequential Testing Update
Users can now reduce the [minimum sample size to 100](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360020640752-Monitor-and-experiment-settings#minimum-sample-size) at the organizational level via the admin setting. This allows users to get statistically significant results, faster.
