### What’s new

1. Update feature for ChaosHub enabling users to update details like Git Connector, Repository Name, Branch name & Name for an already connected ChaosHub.
2. Adds CDN Support for Chaos module static artifacts, making UI load faster on client's devices.
3. Added version info in ChaosDriver & ChaosManager. Now, the versions will be available over provided endpoints `/chaos/driver/api/version` & `/chaos/manager/api/version` for ChaosDriver & ChaosManager respectively.
4. Adds a range filter dropdown in the Experiment Runs bar graph under Experiment overview allowing users to set the range on the last runs to be shown in the graph.
5. Adds support for all faults statuses in the Experiment Runs graph. Previously only `Failed` & `Passed` faults were getting shown, now faults in `Awaited`, `Stopped` & `N/A` states will also be available under the Experiment Runs graph.
6. Adds manifest download button in UI for Chaos Infrastructures enabling users to have seamless upgrade.
7. Adds consistent loaders for all components & screens in UI.

### Early access features

No early access features are available in this release.

### Fixed Issues

1. Fixes Enterprise ChaosHub shown irrespective of searched terms by the users.
2. Fixes httpProbe schema in UI to add support for new response timeout changes for HTTP probe. Now, probeTimeout for HTTP probes will be treated as response timeout & should be provided in seconds.
3. Fixes the issue when the details of previously connected chaos infrastructure were getting pre-filled while connecting new chaos infrastructure.
4. Fixes the Run button returning an error even when the Experiment run is already completed.
5. Fixes calendar on the Experiments & Experiment Runs page having a default selection of one week. Now, all experiments & runs will be shown by default.
6. Fixes panic error for k8sObjects and k8sLogs go-routines resulting in closed channel error.
7. Fixes cancel(X) button & back button missing in Enable Chaos Infrastructure screen
8. Fixes repeated error logs for ChaosHub in Chaos-Manager when it was not available to find some of the icons.
9. Fixes the Expected Resilience Score changing to NaN when trying to override the same completely.
10. Fixes resource-type not coming for aborting a Chaos Experiment in audit-trail.
11. Fixes Minor UI/UX Issues making the UI more user-friendly & more accessible.

### Early access features

The Harness Chaos Engineering (HCE) module, which you can use to perform chaos experiments on your applications and infrastructure, is now available for testing. To be part of this testing, contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io). HCE documentation, which includes user guides and [tutorials](https://developer.harness.io/tutorials/run-chaos-experiments), is available on the Harness Developer Hub. Harness recommends that you gain familiarity with the chaos experimentation workflow in HCE by following the instructions in [Your First Chaos Experiment Run](https://developer.harness.io/tutorials/run-chaos-experiments/first-chaos-engineering).
