:::info About Harness Release Notes

* **Progressive deployment:** Harness deploys changes to Harness SaaS clusters on a progressive basis. This means the features described in these release notes may not be immediately available in your cluster. To identify the cluster that hosts your account, go to your **Account Overview** page in Harness.  In the new UI, go to **Account Settings**, **Account Details**, **General**, **Account Details**, and then **Platform Service Versions**.
* **Security advisories:** Harness publishes security advisories for every release. Go to the [Harness Trust Center](https://trust.harness.io/?itemUid=c41ff7d5-98e7-4d79-9594-fd8ef93a2838&source=documents_card) to request access to the security advisories.
* **More release notes:** Go to [Harness Release Notes](/release-notes) to explore all Harness release notes, including module, delegate, Self-Managed Enterprise Edition, and FirstGen release notes.
