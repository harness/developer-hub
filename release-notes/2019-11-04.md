#### Feature Monitoring
##### Configurable monitor windows
Configurable monitor windows allow you to select the length of time that Split will check your alert policies. You can select a timeframe between 30 minutes to 90 days after a split version change. The default monitor window will be set to 24 hours.
#### SDK Enhancements
##### JavaScript SDK utilizing Beacon API
Split's JavaScript SDK now utilizes the browser Beacon API to reliably send impressions and events back to Split when your customers move across your application or navigate away, removing the need to explicitly destroy in those scenarios. Upgrade your SDK to take advantage. Nothing else required!
