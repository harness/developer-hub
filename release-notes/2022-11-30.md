##### Dimensional Analysis
[Dimensional Analysis](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360020640752-Monitor-and-experiment-settings#dimensional-analysis) allows users to leverage event property data across all their sources to develop a set of dimensions. These can then be used to dissect experimentation results at a deeper level, giving you the insights needed to make better-informed future hypotheses and experimentation iterations.
