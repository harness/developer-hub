##### Traffic Insights and Alerts
The **Alerts** tab has been renamed **Monitoring** and expanded to show real-time traffic insights over time and any alerts fired for the flag on a single page.

By default, traffic over the **Last 48 hours** is shown, but you may also select the **Last 7 days**, another **Time range**, or a specific **Feature flag version**:
