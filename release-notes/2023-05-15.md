#### Usability Enhancements
##### Simplified Feature Flag Configurations
The [feature flag configuration flow](./static/fme/Simplified-Feature-Flag-Configurations-1.pdf) on the definition tab has been reimagined with updated terminology and new visual cues. This will enable users to configure flags with a higher degree of confidence for any use case (percentage-based rollout, on/off, etc.).
##### Visual Refresh to the Split User Interface
The entire Split application has gone through a [visual refresh](./static/fme/Simplified-Feature-Flag-Configurations-1.pdf). Users will see a modern, forward-looking aesthetic with refined colors tuned for accessibility, visual cues, and more.
##### Terminology Change
To reduce the confusion between "Split", our product, and "split", the feature flag, we are [changing the term "split" to "feature flag"](./static/fme/Simplified-Feature-Flag-Configurations-1.pdf) across our application and documentation.
