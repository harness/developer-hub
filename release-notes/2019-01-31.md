##### Service Limits
Split maintains service limits for each account to help guarantee the availability of the Split service, as well as to minimize billing risks to customers. Split service limits require that you request limit increases manually. In most cases, you aren't charged if your service limits are increased. You're only charged if the limit you are requesting an increase to is a billing limit.  You can review and request increases in the admin settings.

The value of a particular metric can now be capped.  This enables teams to minimize the impact of outliers in their data and remove the impact of bots, allowing for more meaningful experiment results, faster.
