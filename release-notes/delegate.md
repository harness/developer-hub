### New features and enhancements

This release introduces the following new features and enhancements:

- A REST-based operation to fetch a delegate token value was introduced. The operation requires the Harness user role permission `Delegate: Create/Edit`. For information about other delegate token operations, see [Delegate Token Resource](https://apidocs.harness.io/tag/Delegate-Token-Resource). (DEL-5634)

- The delegate installation UI was changed to include the `helm repo update harness` command as an option on the **Apply YAML and verify connection** page. Use this option to obtain the latest version information on the charts in the Harness Helm repository. For more information about the `update` command, see [Helm Repo Update](https://v3-1-0.helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_repo_update/) in the Helm Docs. (DEL-5540)
