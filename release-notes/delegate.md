:::danger Kubernetes Manifest impact on Delegate
Delegate version 24.08.83702 is affected due to rendering logic of Kubernetes Manifest in certain cases only. If you are using this version, please upgrade to version 24.08.83704 to resolve the issue
:::

:::danger ARM64 Architecture Impact on Delegate Versions

Certain delegate versions (`24.07.83608`, `24.07.83607`, `24.07.83606`, `24.07.83605`) are affected due to baked-in AMD64 client binaries on ARM64 architecture, despite building a multiarch image. If you are using any of these versions on ARM64 architecture, please upgrade to version `24.07.83609` or `24.07.83609.minimal` to resolve the issue.

:::danger Breaking change: Updated Delegate Expiration Policy

Harness has updated the delegate expiration policy to 6 months with a 2-month EOL upgrade period.

Six months after a delegate image is released, the delegate reaches End of Support (EOS). Eight months after a delegate image is released, the delegate is End of Life (EOL). Delegates expire if not upgraded 6 months after the image is released. If delegates are past their EOS date, Harness does not support them. Expired delegates might not work as intended. For issues with expired delegates, Harness Support will request that you upgrade your delegate(s).

For more information, go to [Delegate expiration support policy](/docs/platform/delegates/install-delegates/delegate-upgrades-and-expiration#delegate-expiration-support-policy).

:::
## October 2024

### Version 24.09.84100 <!--  October 7, 2024 -->

#### New features and enhancements

- Implemented a limit on the number of delegates and delegate tokens per account and per scope. The maximum number of delegate tokens is now set to 10,000 to ensure better management and scalability. (PL-56296)

#### Fixed issues

- Improved error messaging for the `<+secrets.getValue(secretlocation)>` expression to provide clearer feedback when a secret is not found. The updated message now states, "The secret has not been found," and includes the full computed path for better troubleshooting. (PL-51900, ZD-65130, ZD-69181)

- Resolved an issue in the `UpdateVersionInfoTask` by adding the missing PLATFORM enum, which eliminated the IllegalArgumentException. (PL-51100) 

### Version 24.09.83909 <!--  October 11, 2024 -->

#### Hotfixes

- Improved logging, error handling and force shutdown for stuck cases in winrm script for collecting output variables. These changes are behind a delegate environment variable `ENV_VARS_COLLECTOR_EXPLICIT_EXIT`. Also delegate environment variable `WINRM4J_LOG_LEVEL` for `io.cloudsoft.winrm4j` logging level has been added. (CDS-101843)

### Version 24.09.83908 <!--  October 11, 2024 -->

#### Hotfixes

- With this change entire k8s dry manifest output yaml won't be sanitized. Only config map and secrets kind blocks would be sanitised unless `CDS_K8S_SANITIZE_COMPLETE_DRY_RUN_STEP_OUTPUT`` feature flag is switched on. (CDS-101686)

### Version 24.09.83907 <!--  October 10, 2024 -->

#### Hotfixes

- Jira steps will now ignore unsupported fields which reading a jira ticket. (CDS-101162)

### Version 24.09.83906 <!--  October 1, 2024 -->

#### Hotfixes

- ASG step will not delete all tags and create tags but instead only remove those tags which are not present while running pipleine. (CDS-101285)

## September 2024
### Version 24.08.83805 <!--  September 26, 2024 -->

#### Hotfixes

- WinRM shell script steps now support logs more than 5 hours till maximum of step timeout or 1 day (CDS-101408).

### Version 24.09.83905 <!--  September 20, 2024 -->

#### Hotfixes

- Updated the identifier so that the output obtained from the PowerShell command is parsed correctly (CDS-100036).

### Version 24.08.83803 <!--  September 20, 2024 -->

#### Hotfixes

- Fixed an issue where the secrets will no longer get exposed in Kubernetes Dry Run Step even if they are placed in ConfigMap.

### Version 24.09.83900 <!-- September 9, 2024 -->

#### Fixed issues

- Enhanced webhook notification handling to support secrets in headers, enabling proper decryption of Authorization and other header values stored in the Harness Secret Manager. This ensures seamless webhook triggering without requiring hardcoded values. (PL-55319, ZD-65913)

- Fixed an issue where the AWS Secret Manager validation was failing due to regions being passed instead of full URLs, causing connectivity errors in delegate logs. The region is now correctly converted to a URL, preventing perpetual task failures. (PL-55740, ZD-67142, ZD-67150)

## August 2024

### Version 24.08.83802 <!-- August 26, 2024 -->

#### New features and enhancements

- Upgraded the `dnsjava` library to version `3.6.0` to address CVE-2024-25638, which involved potential security vulnerabilities in DNS query responses. (PL-55721, ZD-63383, ZD-68810)

### Version 24.07.83611, 24.08.83705 <!--  August 30, 2024 -->

#### Hotfix

- Removed unnecessary env expansion and added url_encoding to encode special characters from proxy when curl connectivity pre-check is enabled (PL-56623).
  
### Version 24.08.83704 <!--  August 29, 2024 -->

#### Hotfixes

- Ensure kubernetes secrets are typecasted to Java strings internally before log sanitization. Earlier this was causing ClassCastException for some kubernetes manifests (CDS-100389).
- Updated sensitive log in WinRM deployment to DEBUG level to ensure sensitive data is not leaked (CDS-100046).

### Version 24.07.83609 <!--  August 20, 2024 -->

#### Hotfix

- Modified the default value handling for built-in Docker environment variables for `TARGETPLATFORM`

### Version 24.08.83701 <!--  August 14, 2024 -->

#### New features and enhancements

- Enhanced AppRole token cache for HashiCorp Vault: Updated the cache key calculation to include secretId and approleId. This change fixes a problem where tokens were not being refreshed correctly. Now, the cache accurately reflects the latest credentials, ensuring secure and reliable token management. (PL-55567, ZD-65493)

- Added proxy configuration support for external notification channels in SMP. To address issues faced by customers who operate in air-gapped environments, we've introduced proxy settings for the platform service. By updating the override file with proxy details, notifications via MS Teams and Slack will now function correctly even when behind a proxy. This feature is available in SMP version 0.19.0. (PL-48415, ZD-59707, ZD-62139)

#### Fixed issues

- The delegate initialization process has been moved from a background thread to the start of application. This change addresses issues with health check failures during startup by ensuring that delegate registration, websocket establishment, and heartbeat scheduling are completed before health checks are performed. (PL-55905, ZD-67667)

- Resolved issue with Rollout deployment logs where logs were not available or expandable. This problem, caused by a race condition between stream closure and log dispatching, has been fixed. Logs will now display correctly even under heavy load. (PL-55512, ZD-66330)

### Version 24.07.83608 <!--  August 14, 2024 -->

- Separated the LDAP settings between CG and NG. With this feature, the CG LDAP upgrade to NG LDAP, and CG and NG LDAP settings now operate independently. This feature is behind the feature flag `PL_ENABLE_NG_LDAP_SETTINGS`. To enable this feature, please contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io). (PL-56167)

### Version 24.08.83306 <!--  August 13, 2024 -->

#### Hotfix

- Sensitive secrets were logged in plain text in `delegate.log` due to the use of `secrets.getValue` in environment variables. The logging level for these events has been changed from `error` to `debug` to prevent exposure of secrets. (CI-13785, ZD-68120)

### Version 24.07.83607 <!--  August 13, 2024 -->

#### Hotfix

- Sensitive secrets were logged in plain text in `delegate.log` due to the use of `secrets.getValue` in environment variables. The logging level for these events has been changed from `error` to `debug` to prevent exposure of secrets. (CI-13785, ZD-68120)

### Version 24.07.83406 <!--  August 13, 2024 -->

#### Hotfix

- Sensitive secrets were logged in plain text in `delegate.log` due to the use of `secrets.getValue` in environment variables. The logging level for these events has been changed from `error` to `debug` to prevent exposure of secrets. (CI-13785, ZD-68120)

## July 2024

### Version 24.07.82906 <!--  July 17, 2024 -->

#### Hotfix

- Rollout deployment logs were not available and could not be expanded. Although the deployment was working, the logs were not displaying. The issue has been addressed by ensuring that logs will be shown even on a heavily loaded delegate. (PL-55512, ZD-66330)

### Version 24.07.83404 <!--  July 10, 2024 -->

#### New features and enhancements

- Modified the unique index for delegate token names. The default token name in each scope will now be `default_token` instead of `default_token_org/project`. This change applies only to new projects and organizations; existing projects and organizations will retain their current token names. (PL-51151)

### Version 24.07.83205 <!--  July 9, 2024 -->

#### Hotfix

- When the feature flag `CDS_PERFORM_SHELL_SCRIPT_HOST_CAPABILITY` is enabled, Shell script steps will perform host capability checks. (CDS-97512, ZD-66326, ZD-66349)

- Script executions failed during the Command step for WinRM deployments with a Kerberos auth type when environment variables contained the characters `\v`, `\b`, or `\f`. Now, when the feature flag `CDS_ESCAPE_ENV_VARS_FOR_WINRM_KERBEROS` is enabled, the environment variables will be escaped and script execution will pass. (CDS-97690)

## June 2024

### Version 24.07.82905 <!--  July 1, 2024 -->

#### Hotfix

- Reduced the time for missing heartbeats for delegates before the liveness probe fails from 15 mins to 5 mins. (PL-52037)

### Version 24.06.83304 <!--  June 24, 2024 -->

#### Fixed issues

- Kubernetes services were created during the startup of the delegate, causing the IP pool to be exhausted for NAB. The delegate has been updated to prevent the creation of Kubernetes services upon startup, resolving the issue with IP pool exhaustion. (PL-51550)

- Delegates were running out of memory due to frequent connectivity checks. Optimized the connectivity check process to reduce memory usage, preventing the delegate from running out of memory. (PL-51418, ZD-63705)

- When trying to resolve the expressions in the File Store scripts, Harness encountered a self referencing expression. Due to this condition, the resources associated with two Harness services were exhausted. A code change fixed this issue by preventing such pipeline executions. (PIPE-19585, ZD-64579, ZD-64580)

### Version 24.06.83203 <!--  June 11, 2024 -->

#### Fixed issues

- Delegate logs were displaying entire bearer tokens when using the IDP Kubernetes connector. Added log sanitization to delegate logs to mask commonly used secret patterns. These patterns can be extended per-use-case by adding them to the `/opt/harness-delegate/sanitize-patterns.txt` file inside the delegate. (PL-50889, ZD-64069)

### Version 24.06.83004 <!--  June 7, 2024 -->

#### Hotfix

- Secrets were being printed in plain text when using a custom secret manager, exposing sensitive information. Implemented masking of the `script` field in the custom secret manager to prevent logging of secrets used within the script. (PL-51535, ZD-64069)

### Version 24.06.83003 <!--  June 3, 2024 -->

#### Hotfix

- Resolved an issue with missing labels for Karpenter-managed nodes. (CCM-18139)

## May 2024

### Version 24.05.82711 <!--  May 30, 2024 -->

#### Hotfix

- Resolved an issue where delegates created Kubernetes services when starting up. (PL-51548, PL-51550, ZD-64345)

### Version 24.05.83001 <!--  May 21, 2024 -->

#### New features and enhancements

- Added support for proxies via Secure Connect for GitHub App connectors. (CI-12130, ZD-61883)

### Version 24.05.82904 <!--  May 21, 2024 -->

#### Hotfix

- Tanzu steps will resolve the PCF CLI plugins path by checking the `HOME` environment variable. (CDS-95794, ZD-61882)

### Version 24.05.82205 <!--  May 20, 2024 -->

#### Hotfix

- Delegates will now include memory resource statistics in their logs, providing valuable additional insight for troubleshooting memory-related issues. (PL-51027)

### Version 24.05.82903 <!--  May 16, 2024 -->

#### Hotfix

- Resolved an issue with the Google artifact registry trigger of a pipeline when using a GCP connector with OIDC authentication. (CDS-96627, ZD-62986)

### Version 24.05.82902 <!--  May 10, 2024 -->

#### Hotfix

- Resolved an issue with the delegate health endpoint, enabling the delegate to perform several websocket reconnection attempts before Kubernetes evicts the pod. (PL-50540, ZD-59551, ZD-62207)

### Version 24.04.82901 <!--  May 8, 2024 -->

#### Fixed issues

- Delegates with mTLS enabled were able to send a heartbeat to Harness Manager despite being configured with a non-agent endpoint. Resolved this by ensuring the `isNg` flag is correctly propagated when delegates send heartbeats to Harness Manager. (PL-48891, ZD-60974)

- Intermittent socket timeout exceptions occurred in running pipelines due to secret decryption failures, triggering unnecessary re-broadcasts on the delegate side. Resolved the issue of intermittent secret decryption failures within pipelines, ensuring stable and uninterrupted pipeline execution. (PL-47940, ZD-58006)

- Local login was failing for users assigned admin permissions via a user group. The method to verify if a user is an account admin only considered direct user assignments and did not account for user group roles. Revised the validation process to include both user and user group assignments when checking for admin status. Now, to be recognized as an admin, users must have the specific role assignments outlined below; assigning the `_account_admin` role alone is no longer sufficient for admin rights. (PL-47632)
   - Role: `_account_admin`.
   - Resource-group: `_all_resources_including_child_scopes`, `_all_account_level_resources`.

## April 2024

### Version 24.04.82804 <!--  April 24, 2024 -->

#### Fixed issues

- The delegate task rejection metric was designed to reflect tasks rejected by a delegate due to system-related reasons (such as lack of resources or exceeding the limit of parallel tasks) but did not include specific details like `taskType` or `task ID`. We have enhanced the task rejection metrics by adding `taskType` and `taskId` labels. (PL-48488)

- Users were being logged out when testing a Git connector with invalid credentials due to the Git client's 401 response being propagated to the UI. We have implemented error handling to convert a 401 response from the test connection step to a 400, while preserving the original error message, preventing unintended user logouts. (PL-47753, ZD-58629)

- 2FA reset emails failed to display the QR code properly due to the recent deprecation of Google APIs. The method for generating QR codes has been updated, resolving the issue and ensuring QR codes are now correctly included in 2FA reset emails. (PL-48980, ZD-61314, ZD-61420, ZD-61486)

### Version 24.04.82707 <!--  April 16, 2024 -->

#### New features and enhancements

- Docker delegate images are no longer pushed to `app.harness.io/registry`. To pull images, use `gcr.io/gcr-prod/harness/delegate:<IMAGE_TAG>`. (PL-46947)

- We've added an optional registry mirror configuration for delegate `upgrader`. If you use Docker pull through registry cache (`https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/mirror/`), you can configure `upgrader` to use an optional registry mirror for your delegate images. For more information, go to [Configure an optional registry mirror for delegate images](/docs/platform/delegates/install-delegates/delegate-upgrades-and-expiration#configure-an-optional-registry-mirror-for-delegate-images). (PL-47920, ZD-59005)

#### Fixed issues

- Slack channel notifications failed due to an error related to explicitly setting the Host header as `hooks.slack.com`. We have removed the explicit Host header setting to support both Slack-specific webhook URLs and regular URLs, resolving the issue. (PL-47914)

- In SCIM, creating a new user with special characters in their name failed, preventing the user from being added to Harness and resulting in discrepancies in user group membership between the Identity Provider and Harness. The name of a user will be sanitized if it does not follow Harness naming conventions during user addition flows. (PL-47614)

- Builds triggered by Bitbucket Server push events had incorrect date information in the build history. This issue occurred due to missing date information in the `commits` object returned by the Bitbucket Server API. (CI-11556, ZD-58798)

- Delegate utilization metrics failed to decrease below a set threshold, even when rejecting all tasks. To solve this, memory-based threshold checks have been removed from the delegate due to functional discrepancies. (PL-48781, ZD-60713)

### Version 24.04.82705 <!--  April 12, 2024 -->

#### Hotfix

- Added support for network load balancers in ASG Blue Green deployments. (CDS-95510, ZD-60182)

### Version 24.04.82603 <!--  April 4, 2024 -->

#### Hotfix

- Added additional retries on failures when verifying Docker images during CD deployments. (CDS-93180, ZD-58933, ZD-59370, ZD-60138)

## March 2024

### Version 24.03.82601 <!--  March 28, 2024 -->

#### Hotfix

- Added multiple log lines for debugging an issue. (CDS-93910)

### Version 24.03.82600 <!--  March 26, 2024 -->

#### New features and enhancements

- In the recent update to `ng-manager` version 1.28.0, we have implemented enhancements to the validation mechanism for secret identifiers. We now provide more flexibility and precision in validating secret identifiers, particularly regarding hyphen usage. While previously disallowed, secret identifiers can now contain hyphens. However, there are specific rules governing their usage. Hyphens are now permitted anywhere in the secret identifier, including at the end of the string. The updated validation allows for multiple occurrences of hyphens within the secret identifier. Secret identifiers cannot start with a hyphen, following best practices. (PL-46959)

#### Fixed issues

- The delegate metrics endpoint `/api/metrics` had its content type set as `application/json`, causing scraping issues with certain versions of Prometheus due to content type incompatibility. Attempts to switch to text/plain resulted in a 406 response code. We have revised the endpoint to deliver metrics in `plainText`. You can now specify the desired content format `plainText` or `JSON` by setting the "Accept" header in your request, ensuring broader compatibility with different Prometheus versions. (PL-46976, ZD-57489)

- Fixed an issue where [Bitbucket connectors with API access enabled](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/connectors/code-repositories/ref-source-repo-provider/bitbucket-connector-settings-reference/#enable-api-access) sometimes became unresponsive. (CDS-93298, ZD-56619, ZD-58844, ZD-59381)

- Setting up a monitored service using cloud metrics from the Google Cloud Operations health source was unable to list dashboards to build query. (CDS-92355)

### Version 24.03.82505 <!--  March 18, 2024 -->

#### Hotfix

- The `ap-south-2` region is now supported for use with AWS Secrets Manager. (CDS-92541, ZD-58686)

### Version 24.03.82502 <!--  March 13, 2024 -->

#### New features and enhancements

- Introduced separate environment variables to manage delegate resource thresholds for CPU and Memory when dynamic handling is enabled. Use `CPU_USAGE_THRESHOLD` for CPU control (default: no limit). Use `MEMORY_USAGE_THRESHOLD` for memory control (default: 80%). If you are using `RESOURCE_USAGE_THRESHOLD` (deprecated), it exclusively controls the memory threshold. (PL-47746)

- OPA policy enforcement has been introduced to three new entities: Service Accounts, API Keys, and Tokens. For Service Accounts and API Keys, naming convention policies are enforced, while for Tokens, Time-To-Live (TTL) policies are enforced. These enforcement mechanisms are seamlessly integrated into both create and update operations, ensuring adherence to predefined standards during the `onSave` action. (PL-46778)

- Support added to enable OPA policy for naming convention enforcement while creating or updating a service account. (PL-46777)

#### Fixed issues

- Attempts to use the `harness_platform_user` resource to create or delete users resulted in an error. The message "Request failed as you have an older version of an entity, please reload the page and try again" was displayed and the Terraform state went out of sync with Harness. This issue has been fixed. (PL-39870, ZD-47107)

- Continuous Verification for Google Cloud Operations logged error for the `resourceName` field. This issue is fixed by changing the identifier in the request body from `projectId` to `resourceName` for data collection tasks as mentioned in the Google API [documentation](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/reference/v2/rest/v2/entries/list). (CDS-89441)

### Version 24.03.82408 <!--  March 8, 2024 -->

#### Hotfix

- Fixed an infinite loop issue in the delegate SCM service. (PL-48043)

- Added support for GitOps pipeline steps with Harness Code and bumped the SCM version to `d78720584`. (CODE-1572)

### Version 24.02.82406 <!--  March 1, 2024 -->

#### Hotfix

- Previously, during the creation of rollback data, AWS Lambda would use string values for function versions. However, it now considers the integer values of function versions. This means that if you have deployed function versions `{8,9,10}` and you are currently deploying version `{11}`, the previous rollback version will be `{10}`, instead of `{9}`. (CDS-92300)

## February 2024

### Version 24.02.82404 <!--  February 29, 2024 -->

#### Hotfix

- Updated the behavior of the Scale step. After the Scale step is executed, all workload pods are published as new pods, as the scale step can be used to scale pods and change traffic on the pods. (CDS-91534, ZD-54319)

### Version 24.02.82402 <!--  February 27, 2024 -->

#### Fixed issues

- The retry interval for attempting to create or read secrets from HashiCorp Vault was fixed at 1 second after each failure. (PL-46595, ZD-57053)

  The retry interval has now been modified to increase by a factor of 2 times the number of failures. Consequently, after the first failure, the second attempt will occur after a 2-second delay, and the third attempt will be made after a 4-second delay, enhancing the robustness of secret management operations.

- When linking an SSO group with over 1,000 users, only 1,000 users were syncing in Harness due to a limitation with LDAP groups syncing. (PL-46492, ZD-56741)

   Implemented LDAP to perform paginated queries by default for large groups, with a fallback to non-paginated calls, ensuring complete user synchronization.

- Pipelines were failing due to errors related to the inability to acquire delegate tasks. (PL-42600, ZD-54025, ZD-54324)

   The logic for calculating CPU and Memory usage has been improved, specifically for scenarios utilizing the dynamic task request handling feature in delegates, enhancing the reliability of task allocation and pipeline execution.

- A null pointer exception was occurring for enforcement limit accounts, triggered by the introduction of the startup plan. (GTM-3247)

   This issue has been resolved by implementing an appropriate error message code for enforcement limit accounts when customers reach their enforcement limits, eliminating the null pointer exception.

- Users were unable to create custom queries as a heath source for monitored services. (CDS-91181, ZD-57562)

   This issue is fixed by making the service instance field configurable for users.

### Version 24.02.82309 <!--  February 28, 2024 -->

#### Hotfix

- We identified and resolved a high memory and CPU utilization issue in our delegate pods, traced back to improper handling of Chronicle libraries. The fix involved ensuring the StoreTailer objects are closed after each use, significantly improving system performance and stability. (CCM-16052)

### Version 24.02.82308 <!--  February 21, 2024 -->

#### Hotfix

- Upgraded the SDK for the ASG swimlane. (CDS-91937)

### Version 24.02.82306 <!--  February 16, 2024 -->

#### Hotfix

- Added default values for minimum healthy percentage as 90 and maximum healthy percentage as 110 for the instance refresh operation that is performed during ASG Rolling deployments to prevent service downtime. (CDS-91335, ZD-57686)

### Version 24.02.82304 <!--  February 12, 2024 -->

#### Hotfix

- Fixed an issue in ECS Blue Green deployments where the ECS service was deleted after the first or second deployment. (CDS-91499, ZD-57892)

### Version 24.02.82303 <!--  February 2, 2024 -->

#### Hotfix

- Fixed an issue for GitHub connectors when Fetch Files failed because of an NPE error. (CDS-91176, ZD-57550)

### Version 24.02.82302 <!--  February 12, 2024 -->

#### Behavior changes

- In the blue/green stage scale down step, we used to scale down deployments, statefulsets, daemonsets, deploymentConfig and delete HPA, and PDB resources. During scale down, we updated the field `replicas` to 0. In Kubernetes, if HPA is configured it is not mandatory to define replicas. So when another deployment happens and we apply the same old deployments manifest it does not update the replicas field and it remains set to 0. This results in no deployment even though the pipeline is successful. This issue has not been resolved. Instead, we scale down only DaemonSets and delete deployment, deploymentConfig, HPA, PDB, and statefulset resources. (CDS-88999, ZD-56645)

#### Fixed issues

- Addressed an issue where pod deletion didn't trim excess whitespace in namespace names, which could prevent pod cleanup. (CI-10636, ZD-54688)

- Fixed an issue where pipelines could fail when triggered by BitBucket PRs with more than 25 commits. This error was due to an infinite loop situation that could occur when there was pagination in the BitBucket List PR Commits API payload. (CI-11220, ZD-57421)

- Harness CI no longer stores clone tokens for public GitHub repositories as environment variables, because a token isn't needed to clone public repos. (CI-10938)

- The error message text for the `no eligible delegates present` error now includes additional potential causes. (CI-10933, ZD-55977)

## January 2024

### Version 24.01.82202 <!--  January 29, 2024 -->

#### Fixed issues

- The Azure endpoints were not being set according to the Azure environment selected, which caused the Azure connectors to function properly only for the Azure public cloud but not for other Azure cloud variations such as Azure Gov, Azure China, and so on. (PL-43333, ZD-54717)

   Now, the correct Azure resource manager endpoint will be chosen based on the environment selected in the connector.

- [PR status updates](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/codebase-configuration/scm-status-checks) now send correctly when using a [GitHub App in a GitHub connector](/docs/platform/connectors/code-repositories/git-hub-app-support) with a secret (instead of plain text) for the **Application ID**. (CI-11025, ZD-56177)

### Version 24.01.82110 <!--  January 29, 2024 -->

#### Hotfix

- You can now hide sensitive log information in the Harness UI based on regular expression patterns. (PL-46531, ZD-56849)

   For more information, go to [Hide log information using regex patterns](/docs/platform/delegates/manage-delegates/hide-logs-using-regex).

### Version 24.01.82109

#### Hotfix

- Application logs were printed in TAS deployment execution logs. (CDS-89172)

   Harness added a new environment variable `DISABLE_CF_APP_LOG_STREAMING` to enhance control over this behavior. Setting this variable to `true` will redact all application logs, providing users with more flexibility in managing log visibility.

### Version 24.01.82108 <!--  January 15, 2024 -->

#### Early access features

- Allowlist verification for delegate registration (PL-42471)

    :::info note
    Currently, allowlist verification for delegate registration is behind the feature flag `PL_ENFORCE_DELEGATE_REGISTRATION_ALLOWLIST`. Contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io) to enable the feature.
    :::

   Without this feature flag enabled, delegates with an immutable image type can register without allowlist verification. With this feature flag enabled, delegates with an immutable image type can register if their IP/CIDR address is included in the allowed list received by Harness Manager. The IP address/CIDR should be that of the delegate or the last proxy between the delegate and Harness Manager in the case of a proxy.

   Harness Manager verifies registration requests by matching the IP address against an approved list and allows or denies registration accordingly. For more information, go to [Add and manage IP allowlists](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/security/add-manage-ip-allowlist/).

#### Fixed issues

- Intermittent errors occurred when pulling secrets from a Custom Secret Manager. (PL-43193, ZD-54236, ZD-54555, ZD-55919)

   This issue has been resolved by adding a timeout (in seconds) to fetch secrets from a custom provider in the Custom Secret Manager settings. The process interrupts and fails when it takes longer than the configured timeout to fetch the secret. The default value is 20 seconds.

- Fixed an issue where pod creation failed in Kubernetes cluster build infrastructures if the pod volume mount key exceeded 63 characters. (CI-10789, ZD-55265)

### Version 23.12.82000 <!--  January 2, 2024 -->

#### Fixed issues

- For user groups provisioned from SCIM to Harness, for the corresponding user groups created in Harness, the user group `identifier` is derived from the display name of the user group in the SCIM provider. Harness replaces `.` (dots) and `-` (dashes) with an `_` (underscore). All other special characters (`#`, `?`, `%`, and so on) and spaces are removed. Leading digits`0` through `9` and `$` are also removed. (PL-42535, ZD-53830, ZD-55294)

   All special characters except `.`, `-`, and non-leading `$` and digits `0` through `9` are removed.

   **Example 1:** For a user group in SCIM with the name `Harness.Group?Next#Gen-First`, the user group created in Harness will have the `identifier`: `Harness_GroupNextGen_First`.

   **Example 2:** For a user group in SCIM with the name `123#One.$Two.$Three.123`, the user group created in Harness will have the `identifier`: `One_$Two_$Three_123`.

   The existing behavior of `.` and `-` changed to `_` has been retained.

   The name of the corresponding user group created in Harness will retain the special symbols as present in the user group of the SCIM provider. Example: For a user group in SCIM with the name `Harness.Group?Next#Gen-First`, the user group created in Harness will have the same `name`: `Harness.Group?Next#Gen-First`.

### Version 24.01.82005

#### Hotfix

- Added extra logs to capture CI pod cleanup issues for Windows. (CI-10636, ZD-54688)

### Version 24.01.82002

#### Hotfix

- In the HTTP step, when a MTLS server was used, the task was not assigned to a delegate. (CDS-87547, ZD-55531)

   This issue has been fixed.

### Version 23.12.81811

#### Hotfix

- Added support for the Tanzu application service Client ID and Secret ID via env variables in the delegate. (CDS-88086)

   You can now create a Tanzu connector by setting the `AS_REFRESH_TOKEN_CLIENT_ID`, `TAS_REFRESH_TOKEN_CLIENT_SECRET`, `ENABLE_TAS_REFRESH_TOKEN_CLIENT_ID` parameters, and providing the Refresh token. The connector will generate a Refresh token using the Client ID and Secret ID.

## Previous releases

### 2023 releases

<details>
<summary>2023 releases</summary>

#### December 2023

##### Versions 23.12.81411, 23.12.81604, 23.12.81806

###### Delegate security hotfix

- Added additional log sanitization for Git connector flows.

   If you are running delegate versions 23.11.814xx or 23.11.816xx, upgrade to delegate version 23.12.81604. If you are running version 23.12.818xx, upgrade to delegate version 23.12.81806 or later.

##### Harness version 81820, Harness Delegate version 23.12.81803

###### Early access features

- If green services exist in your Blue Green deployment, you can configure Harness to update those services instead of deleting them and then re-creating them with a new manifest and artifact. Updating existing green services is beneficial because new containers come up before old ones go down. For more information, go to [Update green services](/docs/continuous-delivery/deploy-srv-diff-platforms/aws/ecs/ecs-deployment-tutorial/#update-green-services). (CDS-82763)

   Additionally, before beginning the deployment, Harness validates the blue and green services based on the target group and tags them appropriately. If the validation fails, Harness aborts the deployment. For more information, go to [ECS blue/green service validations](/docs/continuous-delivery/deploy-srv-diff-platforms/aws/ecs/ecs-deployment-tutorial/#ecs-blue-green-service-validation).

###### Fixed issues

- For Rancher-based Kubernetes or Native Helm deployments and instance sync, Harness uses Rancher's `generateKubeconfig` API action. A new kubeconfig token is created on the Rancher cluster each time this API is hit. This led to an accumulation of kubeconfig tokens over time on the Rancher cluster. (CDS-83055, ZD-52924)

  This issue has been fixed. Harness now cleans up the kubeconfig token it creates during deployment or instance sync executions.

  To receive this fix, upgrade your delegate to the latest delegate version.

-  If instance refresh during an ASG deployment took too much time and timed out, a rollback was triggered. If the instance refresh was still in progress when the rollback was triggered, the rollback failed. (CDS-83821)

   This issue has been fixed.

- When streaming log messages from PowerShell scripts, Harness streamed only those console logs that had INFO and ERROR severity levels. (CDS-84570, ZD-53860)

  This issue has been fixed. Now, Harness forwards console logs that have INFO, WARNING, DEBUG, and ERROR severity levels.

- Harness printed logs from the Delete Stack step in the reverse order. (CDS-84744, ZD-53865)

  This issue has been fixed.

- The Jenkins step failed when attempting to resolve secrets in expressions used in its job parameters, and the following message was displayed: `Error occurred while starting Jenkins task java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Illegal character in query at index` (CDS-84747, ZD-53836)

  The issue has been resolved.

- If shell script execution fails with an exception such as a step timeout, the delegate logs include the message "Exception in script execution". This message does not help attempts to determine the root cause. (CDS-85024, ZD-54110)

  This issue has been fixed. The delegate logs now include a more meaningful message.

- There was an issue with the filtering of items that had tags on the delegate list page. This was resolved by adding an implicit tag before filtering the items in the UI. (PL-42743)

- When the feature flag `PL_NO_EMAIL_FOR_SAML_ACCOUNT_INVITES` is enabled and a new user was added on the Account Access Control: Users page, the following message was displayed: "Invitation sent successfully", even though the user was added to the list. (PL-42860)

   This issue has been resolved, and the UI now displays "User added successfully".

##### Version 23.12.81809

###### Hotfix

- Fixed an issue where GitHub Issue Comment event triggers were failing when used with GitHub Enterprise Server. (CDS-85419)

##### Version 23.12.81808

###### Hotfix

- Fixed an issue where Shell Script steps with SSH were failing with `Error while reading variables to process Script Output. Avoid exiting from script early: 2: No such file` for newer delegate versions. (CDS-87415, ZD-55629, ZD-55690)

##### Version 23.12.81804

###### Hotfix

- You can now use a Refresh token to authenticate with the Tanzu connector. This Refresh token is used by Harness to verify your Tanzu instance. However, you still need to provide a username and password to authenticate with Tanzu. If a Refresh token isn't provided, Harness will use the username and password for the API calls. (CDS-86689)

#### November 2023

##### Harness version 81612, Harness Delegate version 23.11.81601

###### New features and enhancements

- If you use Kubernetes version 1.16 or later, you can enable the steady state check for Native Helm jobs from Default Settings at any organizational scope (account, organization, or project) in Harness. (CDS-81574)

  To enable the setting, at the desired scope, go to **Default Settings** > **Continuous Delivery**, and then turn on the **Enable Native Helm steady state for jobs** toggle.

  This enhancement eliminates the need for you to contact Harness Support to enable the feature flag `CDS_HELM_STEADY_STATE_CHECK_1_16` and gives you direct control of the setting.

  Accounts for which Harness had enabled this feature flag will have this setting turned on by default.

###### Fixed issues

- When shutdown is initiated, delegates will continue sending heartbeats until all tasks are completed, ensuring all running tasks return a response before shutting down. (PL-42171)

- There was an issue with Harness not properly handling delegate reconnects, which affected delegate metrics. During a disconnect, Harness would mark `delegate_connected` as 0, but after a reconnect, it failed to increment the `delegate_connected` to 1. (PL-42431, ZD-52829, ZD-53399, ZD-53878)

   This issue has been resolved, and now Harness increments the `delegate_connected` to 1 during reconnection. As a result, the `io_harness_custom_metric_delegate_connected` and `io_harness_custom_metric_task_failed` metrics are now accurately reported.

- Fixed the following issues:

   - The delegate Stackdriver logger didn't work if the delegate token was base64-encoded format.
   - When the `DELEGATE_TYPE` was `KUBERNETES` and the delegate wasn't deployed in Kubernetes, the delegate failed to start. (PL-42452)

- Azure Key Vault's heartbeat check now creates a validation secret with a 30-minute expiration, addressing the issue of no expiration being set previously, which resulted in multiple secret versions without an expiry. (PL-42509, ZD-53700)

- User groups could be created via SCIM using identifiers with invalid characters. (PL-42535, ZD-53830)

   This issue is fixed. You can no longer create user groups with invalid characters.

- Harness used Datadog log indexes when running the Verify step but not when fetching sample data in the health source configuration dialog. (CDS-83934, ZD-53433)

  This issue has been fixed.

- If the default capacity for the ASG deployment is zero or Null and you choose to create the same number of ASG instances as those that were previously deployed by the pipeline (the **Same as already running Instances** setting), Harness created zero instances. The deployment timed out after waiting for health checks. (CDS-83818)

  This issue has been fixed. Now, if the default capacity is zero or Null, Harness sets the default capacity to match that in Harness FirstGen, which is as follows:
    * For the first deployment:
      - minimum = 0
      - desired = 6
      - maximum =10
    * For other deployments:
      - minimum = 0
      - desired = 1
      - maximum = 1

- Starting with Delegate version 23.08.79713, the custom script for fetching remote manifests did not support absolute paths as the folder path. (CDS-83443, ZD-52872)

  This issue has been fixed.

- The Helm connector's test to check connectivity to an OCI Helm repository in AWS ECR failed with an "Invalid request: Invalid oci url..." error even though the URL to the repository conformed with the formats described in [Connect to an Artifact repository](/docs/platform/connectors/artifact-repositories/connect-to-an-artifact-repo). The delegate was configured to use a proxy server and the Anonymous authentication type. However, manually fetching Helm charts from the delegate were successful. (CDS-82779, ZD-52343)

  This issue has now been resolved. The OCI Helm connector now works with the Anonymous authentication type when a proxy server is configured on the delegate.

- After fetching tags from Google Artifact Registry, Harness sorted them lexically and not on the timestamp. (CDS-82778)

  This issue has been fixed. Harness now sorts the tags on the timestamp.

- Pipeline executions for WinRM deployments failed intermittently when the deployment was performed by Harness Delegate with version 23.11.81015. Certain processes managed by the Windows Remote Management service (namely, `winrshost.exe` with its child process `conhost.exe`) were orphaned and continued to run on the target host. (CDS-82777, ZD-52759, ZD-53411, ZD-53460, ZD-53683)

  This issue has been fixed.

- Certain Docker registries fail authentication when using the `/v2` endpoint, which is used for health checks in Docker connectors. (CDS-82616, ZD-52513)

  This issue has been fixed. Harness now falls back to using the `/v2/` endpoint if the `/v2` endpoint fails.

- Harness did not stop Terraform tasks after you canceled pipeline execution, even if you cancelled execution before the task started to run actual Terraform commands. (CDS-82222, ZD-52603)

  This issue has been resolved.

- Currently, the on-premises version of Atlassian BitBucket does not fire push event webhooks when you first push to a new branch. This is inconsistent with other Git providers and also causes Harness's BitBucket triggers for on-premises repositories to behave inconsistently. (CDS-82110, ZD-52270)

  As a workaround for this inconsistency, Harness has made the trigger's workflow capture branch hook events for on-premises BitBucket and convert them, on a best-effort basis, to a push hook. This change has the effect of making Harness's triggers for on-premises BitBucket to fire on the first push to a new branch. This change is behind the feature flag `CDS_NG_CONVERT_BRANCH_TO_PUSH_WEBHOOK_BITBUCKET_ON_PREM`. To enable this change in behavior, contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io).

##### Version 23.11.81602

###### Hotfix

- New connectors failed with an `Internal Server Error. Please contact Harness Support Team.` message. (CI-10414, ZD-54032)

   This issue has been resolved by increasing the sleep time between retries.

##### Harness version 81401, Harness Delegate version 23.11.81405

###### New features and enhancements

- Harness has introduced stage-level timeouts for the following stage types: (CDS-81225)
  - Deploy
  - Build
  - Approval
  - Security Test
  - Pipeline
  - Custom Stage

- Harness updated the delegate metrics count names to include the suffix `_total`. (PL-42354, ZD-52167)

   The following delegate metrics names are updated.

   - `io_harness_custom_metric_task_timeout` is now `io_harness_custom_metric_task_timeout_total`
   - `io_harness_custom_metric_task_completed` is now `io_harness_custom_metric_task_completed_total`
   - `io_harness_custom_metric_task_failed` is now `io_harness_custom_metric_task_failed_total`
   - `io_harness_custom_metric_task_rejected` is now `io_harness_custom_metric_task_rejected_total`

- Harness has updated our account data deletion period from 90 days to 60 days. (PL-41444)

###### Fixed issues

- Fetching a repository and attempting to read a file that did not exist on the file system resulted in an exception, and Harness failed to handle that exception appropriately. The console logs displayed the following message: "Exception in processing GitFetchFilesTask. Reason: Unable to checkout file: `<file-path>`." (CDS-82631)

  This issue has been fixed.

- When using the Generic repository format to fetch artifacts from Artifactory, if you used an artifact filter and a non-Regex value for the artifact path, an issue occurred. The issue caused the metadata URL in the service outcome to be incorrect; the URL did not include the repository name. (CDS-82579)

  This issue is fixed.

- HorizontalPodAutoscaler (HPA) and PodDisruptionBudget (PDB) could not be used in Kubernetes deployments if they contained fields that are not supported by the Kubernetes schema. (CDS-82370)

  This issue has been fixed by the addition of support for such fields.

- Harness did not honor the working directories specified in script units in the Command steps used in WinRM deployments. Instead, Harness used the default directory configured for the user profile on the target VM. (CDS-82105)

  This issue has been fixed. Harness now uses the working directory that you specify in script units. However, the fix has been deployed behind the feature flag `CDS_PRESERVE_WINRM_WORKING_DIR_FOR_COMMAND_UNITS`. Contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io) to enable the fix.

- The services dashboard did not correctly show primary and canary instances in a Kubernetes deployment. (CDS-81869, ZD-52262, ZD-52930)

  The issue occurred because Harness treated the canary instances and primary instances as one set of instances. Consequently, during the canary deployment, Harness also updated the primary instances with current deployment details. This was not correct because primary deployment hadn't begun yet. This issue affected post-production rollbacks.

  This issue has been resolved. Now, Harness splits the canary instances and primary instances into two groups and updates each group with the deployment details that are relevant to them.

- If connectivity issues between Harness and the Git provider cause a file that existed in the repository to not be found on the file system after performing a fetch, the Update Release Repo step creates a new file. (CDS-80902, ZD-51818)

  This issue has been fixed. If Harness experiences a connectivity issue with a Git provider when executing a step, it fails the step after a few retries.

- Secrets that are referenced in a service variable are displayed on the secret's **References** tab but secrets that are referenced in an environment's service overrides are not. (CDS-80615)

  This issue has been fixed.

- When the Update Release Repo step failed on the delegate, the error message was not propagated to the Harness user interface, and you had to search the delegate logs to determine the cause of the issue.

  This issue has been fixed. The error message is now propagated from the delegate to the Harness user interface. (CDS-79094)

- The project admin role wasn't being assigned to a project created via an account or org scope service account. Now, when a project is created, the project admin role is automatically assigned to the service account. This is also reflected in the audit trails. (PL-41845, ZD-51918)

- Previously, if you had an SSH secret key with a **Text** reference pre-selected, you could only update it using YAML but not via the UI. The UI displayed only the **File** secret types. Harness has now added a dropdown menu in the **Create or Select an Existing Secret** dialog that allows you to select the **Secret type** as either **File** or **Text**. This simplifies the process of updating SSH secrets, making it easier for you to manage your secrets. (PL-41507, ZD-47600, ZD-51334)

##### Version 23.11.81406

###### Hotfix

- Fixed the orphaned `winrshost.exe` process and its child `conhost.exe` process that were bumping on host infrastructure after WinRM deployment. (CDS-82777, ZD-52759, ZD-53411, ZD-53460, ZD-53683)

##### Version 23.11.81408

###### Hotfix

- A default tag is now included in the Auto Scaling Group (ASG) for the Name key. The tag value is set to match the ASG name and is automatically propagated upon instance launch. This feature is especially useful if you rely on instance names for managing metrics. (CDS-84681)

#### October 2023

##### Harness version 81205, Harness Delegate version 23.10.81202

Harness NextGen release 81205 includes the following changes for the Harness Delegate.

###### New features and enhancements

- You can now configure the delegate logging level by setting the `LOGGING_LEVEL` environment variable. Valid values are `TRACE`, `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`, and `OFF`. If an invalid value is specified, the logging level defaults to `DEBUG`. If no value is specified, the logging level defaults to `INFO`. (PL-41644, ZD-51430)

- When you [configure a Kubernetes build farm to use self-signed certificates](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/set-up-build-infrastructure/k8s-build-infrastructure/configure-a-kubernetes-build-farm-to-use-self-signed-certificates), you can now use `DESTINATION_CA_PATH` instead of `CI_MOUNT_VOLUMES` and `ADDITIONAL_CERTS_PATH`. (CI-9707)
   * For `DESTINATION_CA_PATH`, provide a comma-separated list of paths in the build pod where you want the certs to be mounted, and mount your certificate files to `opt/harness-delegate/ca-bundle`.
   * Both CI build pods and the SCM client on the delegate support this method.
   * You can use either method (`DESTINATION_CA_PATH` or both `CI_MOUNT_VOLUMES` and `ADDITIONAL_CERTS_PATH`). If you specify both, `DESTINATION_CA_PATH` takes precedence. If Harness can't resolve `DESTINATION_CA_PATH`, it falls back to `CI_MOUNT_VOLUMES` and `ADDITIONAL_CERTS_PATH`.

- JGit library upgrade (CDS-80715, ZD-51149)

  Eclipse JGit libraries have been upgraded to version 6.6.1.202309021850-r.

- To improve security, Harness has introduced a feature that allows you to add domain allowlists for Email, Slack, Microsoft Teams, Webhook, and PagerDuty notification channels at the account level. Earlier, this was only supported for fixed URL domains. Now, support has been added for expression URLs. (PL-39481, ZD-43735)

###### Fixed issues

- Revised the error message that is shown when a pipeline fails due to lack of eligible delegates. (CI-9743)

- Optimized delegate logging related to the CI task handler to consume less space. (CI-9771)

- When saving secret files, Harness FirstGen and Harness NextGen encode the file content with the ISO_8859_1 character set. However, while Harness FirstGen correctly decodes the file content referenced by the `configFile.getAsBase64()` functor, Harness NextGen uses UTF-8. The issue caused additional padding bytes to be included in the P12 config file and authorization errors with GCP Pub/Sub in Harness NextGen. (CDS-81032, ZD-51928)

  This issue has been fixed. Now, Harness NextGen uses the ISO_8859_1 character set while decoding secrets from the secret store and subsequently uses Base64 encoding.

- Harness did not handle appropriately the failure status codes returned by the GitLab API for the Merge PR step. (CDS-80927)

  This issue has been fixed.

- The Tags field in the pipeline filter is now optional. This change allows you to filter either by tag name or a combination of tag name and value. (CDS-78992)

##### Version 23.12.81210

###### Hotfix

- GitHub status checks were not refreshing for pipeline executions. Harness added a retry to the GitHub status update API call to resolve the issue. (CI-10618, ZD-54673)

##### Version 23.10.81203

###### Hotfix

- Added IRSA support for downloading S3 artifacts using WinRm/SSH. (CDS-81276, ZD-51938)

##### Harness version 81008, Harness Delegate version 23.10.81010

Harness NextGen release 81008 includes the following changes for the Harness Delegate.

:::danger Breaking change

Harness implemented access checks to restrict unauthorized users from viewing delegate information on the delegate list page. Access checks are now enforced on the page for delegate view permissions. (PL-38958, ZD-50634)

:::

###### New features and enhancements

You can now reference secret values in JSON files by using XPATH. Support is available for AWS Secret Manager, Azure Key Vault, GCP Secret Manager, and HashiCorp Vault. For more information, go to [Reference existing secret manager secrets](/docs/platform/secrets/secrets-management/reference-existing-secret-manager-secrets/). (PL-41063, ZD-51651)

###### Fixed issues

- The Merge PR step fails with GitLab connectors. (CDS-79772)

  This issue has been fixed.

- Execution failure logs associated with an exception named `DuplicateKeyException` included the name of the Harness production server. (CDS-79514, ZD-50804)

  This issue has been fixed.

- Harness now supports the deployment of ECS services whose count is the same as the running instances in a blue-green strategy (CDS-79412)

- If a pipeline that includes the Terragrunt Apply step fails, the Terragrunt working directory is not removed from the file system. Consequently, the delegate container's disk usage gradually increases. The issue occurs when the working directory includes symbolic links. (CDS-79020, ZD-50532)

  This issue has been fixed.

- If a step in a WinRM deployment fails, Harness does not clean up temporary files created on the remote host. (CDS-78304, ZD-49543)

  This issue has been fixed.

- When a [code repo connector](/docs/platform/connectors/code-repositories/connect-to-code-repo) encounters a cert error, the error message shown in the Harness UI is now more informative. (CI-8509)

- Fixed an issue where some [code repo connectors](/docs/platform/connectors/code-repositories/connect-to-code-repo) didn't send the [build status](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/codebase-configuration/scm-status-checks) back to the SCM provider. This happened due to an issue in the Harness Delegate, and it occurred only for code repo connectors that [connected through a Harness Delegate](/docs/platform/connectors/code-repositories/ref-source-repo-provider/git-hub-connector-settings-reference#connectivity-mode-settings). Connectors connecting through the Harness Platform weren't impacted. (CI-9835, ZD-51754, ZD-51758, ZD-51763)

- Fixed an issue where the latest delegate version was not reflected in the latest supported delegate version API. (PL-41151)

   For more information on the latest supported delegate version API, go to [Use automatic upgrade with custom delegate images](/docs/platform/delegates/install-delegates/delegate-upgrades-and-expiration/#use-automatic-upgrade-with-custom-delegate-images).

##### Version 23.11.81015

###### Hotfix

- The service dashboard did not show the new active instance count that resulted from updates made to workload replicas. The issue occurred in a few Helm deployment scenarios, when the updates were made after deployment. (CDS-82385, ZD-52612)

  This issue has been fixed.

- When you [configure a Kubernetes build farm to use self-signed certificates](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/set-up-build-infrastructure/k8s-build-infrastructure/configure-a-kubernetes-build-farm-to-use-self-signed-certificates), you can now use `DESTINATION_CA_PATH` instead of `CI_MOUNT_VOLUMES` and `ADDITIONAL_CERTS_PATH`. (CI-9707)
   * For `DESTINATION_CA_PATH`, provide a comma-separated list of paths in the build pod where you want the certs to be mounted, and mount your certificate files to `opt/harness-delegate/ca-bundle`.
   * Both CI build pods and the SCM client on the delegate support this method.
   * You can use either method (`DESTINATION_CA_PATH` or both `CI_MOUNT_VOLUMES` and `ADDITIONAL_CERTS_PATH`). If you specify both, `DESTINATION_CA_PATH` takes precedence. If Harness can't resolve `DESTINATION_CA_PATH`, it falls back to `CI_MOUNT_VOLUMES` and `ADDITIONAL_CERTS_PATH`.

#### September 2023

##### Harness version 80811, Harness Delegate version 23.09.80804

Harness NextGen release 80811 includes the following changes for the Harness Delegate.

:::danger Breaking change

When using the Terragrunt **All Modules** **Module Configuration**, the Terragrunt Plan and Apply commands don't include the  `--terragrunt-include-external-dependencies` CLI options flag. (CDS-87234)

If your Terragrunt configuration has module dependencies and you want to target all dependencies, use CLI options from the corresponding Plan or Apply step to add the `--terragrunt-include-dependencies` flag.

:::

###### New features and enhancements

- Upgraded the Bouncy Castle library to address potential vulnerabilities. (PL-40729, ZD-48823)

   - `org.bouncycastle:bcpg-jdk15on:jar:1.70` to `org.bouncycastle:bcpg-jdk18on:jar:1.76`
   - `org.bouncycastle:bcpkix-jdk15on:jar:1.70` to `org.bouncycastle:bcpkix-jdk18on:jar:1.76`
   - `org.bouncycastle:bcprov-ext-jdk15on:jar:1.70` to `org.bouncycastle:bcprov-ext-jdk18on:jar:1.76`
   - `org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk15on:jar:1.70` to `org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk18on:jar:1.76`

<!-- Add to 809xx or future release when feature is complete
- You can now reference secret values in JSON files by using XPATH. Support is available for AWS Secret Manager, Azure Key Vault, GCP Secret Manager, and HashiCorp Vault. (PL-41063)
-->

- Harness CD now supports auto-scaling of green services in the ECS Blue Green Swap Target step. (CDS-79414)

- Terragrunt steps now support CLI options flags.

###### Fixed issues

- The Kustomize 3.5.4 binary is now removed from the immutable delegate, and all Kustomize tasks are routed via the Kubectl binary. (CDS-58893, ZD-48553)

- In certain scenarios for ECS Blue Green deployments, the Green application was not rolling back. We have added functionality to handle this scenario. We now consistently roll back the Green service in ECS Blue Green deployments. (CDS-76795, ZD-49005, ZD-49919)

- Fixed an issue where ShellScript WinRM deployments would not honor the configured timeout. For example, the step would time out by default in 30 minutes even when the configured timeout was 1 day. Now the WinRM session timeout will be set to 30 minutes or the timeout configured for the step (if more than 30 minutes). (CDS-78219, ZD-48180, ZD-49871)

- Fixed an issue with Artifactory artifact fetches in the pipeline, when the artifact path was in a nested directory and also a regex. (CDS-78278, ZD-50030)

- Resolved an issue when copying config files from BitBucket repositories if a folder path was specified instead of a file path. (CDS-78344, ZD-49489)

- The output of the Kubernetes Dry Run step did not generate a valid Kubernetes manifest due to the masking of the secrets values (CDS-78507).

  Harness was masking all the secrets values using the character set `***` for both stringData and data fields in Secrets Resources. Since the data field supports only Base64 encoded values, this resulted in an invalid manifest. With this fix, Harness uses a valid value to mask these data fields (`Kioq`, the Base64 value of `***`).

- Harness did not handle the `Unknown Host Exception` error appropriately and, consequently, showed the misleading "Delegates are not available for performing operation" message when you configured LDAP incorrectly (for example, you entered an incorrect host or port number). (PL-28077)

  This issue has been fixed.

- Harness showed JSON Web Token URLs in Delegate task logs associated with shell script task failures. (PL-39102)

  This issue has been fixed.

- Delegates failed to reauthenticate with the proxy after the initial proxy session expired. (PL-40630, ZD-48981, ZD-49626)

   The following updates to delegate communication with Harness Manager over proxy resolve this issue.

   - Removed `return null` when the delegate receives the required 407 proxy authentication.

   - Added the following variables for the `asyncHttpClient` to authenticate with the proxy.
      - `org.asynchttpclient.AsyncHttpClientConfig.proxy.user`
      - `org.asynchttpclient.AsyncHttpClientConfig.proxy.password`

- Harness Platform release 80504 did not allow you to create empty user groups. (PL-41005, ZD-50411, ZD-50475)

  This issue has been fixed.

- When steps timed out for aborted tasks that were previously assigned, the UI displayed an incorrect error message. (PL-41226, ZD-49908, ZD-50652)

  The UI now displays the correct error message.

- The UI allowed all users to select the **Copy token** option from the **More Options** (&vellip;) menu. (PL-41155)

   This issue has been resolved. Now, only users with the required permissions to copy tokens are able to select the **Copy token** option.

- Fixed an issue where build pods weren't cleaned up if Harness selected an invalid delegate for the cleanup task. This could happen if you used [delegate selectors](/docs/platform/delegates/manage-delegates/select-delegates-with-selectors) based on [delegate tags](/docs/platform/delegates/manage-delegates/select-delegates-with-selectors#delegate-tags), and multiple delegates had the same tags, but some of those delegates didn't have access to the cluster. Now Harness checks the selected delegate's connectivity to the cluster before assigning a task to that delegate. (CI-8831, ZD-47647)

- The execution logs from the Initialize step showed SSH keys used in the environment for the Command step. (CDS-79144, ZD-50623)

  This issue has been fixed.

##### Version 23.10.80808

###### Hotfix

- For generic (non-Docker) artifacts available in Artifactory, you can use an expression to specify the path to the artifact. This filter works in the same way as the artifact filter in Harness FirstGen, and it is useful when you want to fetch artifacts from multiple paths. (CDS-78181)

- Updated the internal Jenkins library to support long IDs for Jenkins builds. Previously, supported IDs were limited to integer bounds. (CDS-79499, ZD-50718, ZD-50888)

- Fixed an issue where Git statuses were not being sent for pull requests. (CES-1376)

- Added support for referencing JSON secret keys with dots at the top level. Nested keys with dots are not supported. (PL-41715)

##### Harness version 80504, Harness Delegate version 23.09.80505

Harness NextGen release 80504 includes the following changes for the Harness Delegate.

###### New features and enhancements

- Upgraded `io.netty:netty*` to version `4.1.94.final` to address vulnerabilities. (CI-8971, ZD-48488)

- API Call logs now include details such as response, size, duration, HTTP verb, and response code in the summary. (OIP-767)

- If the Email step failed to send a notification, the following message was displayed: "Failed to send the email. Check SMTP configuration." The message did not include any additional information to help you debug the issue. (PL-40007, ZD-47524)

   Now, the message has been enhanced to show the cause of failure. It also identifies the delegate that executed the task.

- The OWASP Java HTML Sanitizer version is upgraded to 20220608.1. (PL-40807)

- The Mozilla Rhino library has been upgraded from version 1.7R4 to 1.7.14. (PL-40808)

- The Spring Boot library is upgraded to version 2.7.14. (PL-40810)

- The delegate expiration policy has been extended from 3 months to 6 months. You now only have to update delegates once every 6 months. (PL-39452)

###### Fixed issues

- Fixed a Nexus artifact issue where a fetch timed out when a single group contained more than 50 artifacts. (CDS-73884, ZD-45052, ZD-47206)

- Fixed an intermittent issue where Helm deployment pipelines would report the Helm repository as not found. (CDS-76919)

- Fixed an issue that resulted in Null Pointer Exceptions when running a pipeline manually with a `<+trigger.connectorRef>` expression. This expression gets its data from the trigger payload. With this fix, the pipeline correctly handles the case where the trigger payload is null. (CDS-77736, ZD-49685, ZD-49720, ZD-49722)

- Fixed an issue where the `ACCOUNT_SECRET` environment variable was overriding the `DELEGATE_TOKEN` value in the delegate's Docker container for delegates with an immutable image type (image tag `yy.mm.xxxxx`). (PL-40728)

##### Version 23.09.80512

###### Hotfix

- ShellScript WinRM deployments didn't honor the configured timeout. For example, the step would time out by default in 30 minutes, even when the configured timeout was set to one day. (CDS-78219, ZD-48180, ZD-49871)

   The issue has been resolved. Now, the WinRM session timeout is set to the maximum of the step timeout configured plus 30 minutes.

##### Version 23.09.80511

###### Hotfix

- Previously, there was an issue with the task capacity limiter for delegates where the counter didn't decrement when a task was aborted. (PL-41408)

   This issue has been fixed. Now, when you deploy a delegate and set the `DELEGATE_TASK_CAPACITY` environment variable, the number of concurrent tasks for the delegate is limited to the specified capacity.

##### Version 23.09.80510

###### Hotfix

- Added support for the Artifactory **Artifact Path** filter. (CDS-77244, CDS-79760)

- The task count did not decrease when a task was aborted and the `DELEGATE_TASK_CAPACITY` environment variable was enabled. (PL-41367)

   Harness recommends that you upgrade to delegate version 23.09.80511 to resolve this issue.

##### Version 23.09.80507

###### Hotfix

- When escaping single quotes in environment variables, the same map was passed to subsequent command units which caused the escaped single quotes to escape again. (CDS-75775)

   This issue has been resolved. Subsequent command units do not escape single quotes again.

##### Version 23.09.80506

###### Hotfix

- API calls made to Git providers during deployments caused rate limit errors. (CDS-78950)

  The issue has been resolved. Harness reduced the number of API calls made to Git providers during deployment.

#### August 2023

##### Harness version 80307, Harness Delegate version 23.08.80308

Harness NextGen release 80307 includes the following changes for the Harness Delegate.

###### New features and enhancements

- If you use the App Role authentication method in the HashiCorp Vault connector, you can choose to cache the vault token. The token is cached on the Harness Delegate for a time duration equal to the TTL of the vault token, with 1% leeway.

  By default, caching is enabled for all existing connectors. To disable caching, go to the connector's YAML configuration and set the `enableCache` parameter to `false`. Harness UI support to enable and disable caching will be added in a subsequent release. (PL-39821)

- To safeguard your operations and protect against potential security vulnerabilities, Harness deprecated the Helm 2 binary from delegates with an immutable image type (image tag `23.08.80308`). For information on delegate types, go to [Delegate image types](/docs/platform/delegates/delegate-concepts/delegate-image-types). (PL-40409)

- In a monitored service, back end license checks and Terraform live monitoring are always on. (SRM-15255)

   Now, monitored services can be enabled only from the user interface (through toggle buttons) and the enable API. Monitored services will always be disabled when created and during subsequent updates to them.

###### Early access features

**GitHub App authentication for GitHub connectors (CI-8577, CI-8367)**

With this feature flag enabled, you can use a GitHub App as the [primary authentication method for a GitHub connector](/docs/platform/connectors/code-repositories/ref-source-repo-provider/git-hub-connector-settings-reference#credentials-settings), and you can use GitHub connectors with GitHub App authentication in the [Git Clone step](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/codebase-configuration/clone-and-process-multiple-codebases-in-the-same-pipeline).

###### Fixed issues

- Fixed an issue where Azure webhook triggers did not work as expected because the delegate could not parse repository URLs in the format `https://{ORG}@dev.azure.com/{ORG}/{PROJECT}/_git/{REPO}`. With this fix, the delegate can parse these URLs and Azure webhook triggers work as expected. (CDS-59023)

- Fixed the behavior of delegate selectors in Jira, ServiceNow and Bamboo build steps. Delegate selectors at the step, stage, and pipeline levels did not override the connector's selector. This meant that both delegate selectors were checked during step execution. With this fix, any selector at the step, stage, or pipeline level overrides the connector's selector. This matches the default behavior in all other step types. (CDS-71025)

- Fixed a UI issue where pipelines, input sets, and executions were ordered incorrectly due to case-sensitive sorting of the element list. With this release, the UI now uses case-insensitive sorting when it lists pipelines, input sets, and pipeline executions. (CDS-73216)

- Fixed an issue where a `<+configFile.getAsBase64(content)>` expression would get parsed incorrectly if it contained multiple lines. (CDS-73424)

- Fixed an issue observed in pipeline executions with service overrides. If an encrypted config file was deleted, a log message would show the path to the deleted file. (CDS-75153, ZD-47557)

- Fixed an issue observed in Blue Green deployments of ASG services, where a repeat deployment incorrectly could result in a scaling down of instances to 0. (CDS-75560)

- Fixed an issue where exceptions happened due to Kubernetes `kubectl` "connection-refused" errors. With this fix, these exceptions are now classified as connectivity errors. This gives you proper control to implement failure strategies based on errors of type Connectivity. (CDS-75777, ZD-48380)

- Introduced a validation to ensure that only repos that are allowed on the basis of `repoAllowList` can be set for pipelines, InputSets, and templates while using the [Edit Git details](/docs/platform/git-experience/configure-git-experience-for-harness-entities/#edit-git-details-for-a-pipeline) feature. (CDS-75828)

- Fixed an issue where the Custom Remote Store did not clone a repo larger than 25Mb if provided in the execution script. With this fix, the Custom Remote Store now has a \<=25Mb size validation on manifest files (not the entire repo). (CDS-75900)

- Removed unnecessary wait time at the end of the initialize step, saving approximately 30 seconds. (CI-9122)

- Fixed an issue where the token value was missing in the delegate token list API call. (PL-39790)

- Fixed an issue where some records did not trigger delegate task assignments. (PL-40148)

- The `publishedDelegateVersion` API incorrectly required edit permission. (PL-40322)

   This issue is fixed. The `publishedDelegateVersion` API now requires only view permission.

##### Version 23.08.80313

###### Hotfix

- There were several `OverlappingFileLockException` errors caused by the version of the Chronicle Queue library used. (CCM-14174)

   The issue has been resolved. We upgraded the Chronicle Queue library to fix the errors.

##### Version 23.08.80312

###### Hotfix

- In previous versions, when utilizing Artifactory as an artifact source, there was an issue where the retrieval of artifacts failed when the specified path included regular expressions, and the path structure was nested rather than flat. We are pleased to announce that this release addresses and resolves this issue.

##### Version 23.08.80311

###### Hotfix

- In some scenarios for Amazon ECS blue/green deployments, the green application didn't roll back consistently because the new service continued to run tasks in the `live-target-group`. To resolve this issue, Harness no longer fetches the count of running services in rollback tasks before rolling back the green service. The green service now rolls back consistently. (CDS-76795, ZD-49005)

##### Version 23.08.80310

###### Hotfix

- Due to intermittent issues with the cf CLI, the Tanzu Application Services (TAS) Rolling deployment step failed to create the application. (CDS-75250)

  Now, before performing a rolling deployment, the TAS Rolling deployment step first verifies that the application exists. If the application does not exist, it deploys the application without using the rolling deployment strategy. If the application exists, it performs a rolling upgrade.

##### Version 23.09.80309

###### Hotfix

- Do not evaluate service variables on the Bash shell when exporting them in Command step. (CDS-75775)

  If a service variable has bash-interpretable characters like dollar ($), they will remain as is when exported in the Command step. Previously, they were being evaluated using the bash interpreter (for example, "abc$1abc" would actually be sent as "abc$bc").

##### Version 23.08.80308

###### Hotfix

- In certain scenarios for Amazon ECS blue/green deployments, the green application was not rolling back. We have added functionality to handle this scenario. We now consistently roll back the green service in Amazon ECS blue/green deployments. (CDS-76795, ZD-49005)

##### Harness version 80120, Harness Delegate version 23.08.80104

###### What's new

- Removed Helm version 3.1 from from delegates with an immutable image type (image tag `yy.mm.xxxxx`). (CDS-58892, ZD-47520, ZD-48553)

   For information on delegate types, go to [Delegate image types](/docs/platform/delegates/delegate-concepts/delegate-image-types).

- Upgraded go-template binary to version 0.4.3, which uses Go version 1.20. (CDS-58919)

- Upgraded the Helm binary from version 3.8 to 3.12. (CDS-58931)

- The `kubectl` command now includes retry logic to handle connection issues. (CDS-72869)

- The Execution Logs have been enhanced to include additional details such as duration, task ID, and more. These details help you understand and debug CV Steps, SRM Live monitoring, and SLI. (OIP-565)

- In manual Query mode, the Datadog Metrics Health source now provides support for formulas. (OIP-568)

   These formulas follow a specific format: Query `a` ; Query `b` ; Formula using `a`, `b`.

   Let's consider an example to illustrate this:

   - Query `a` is "Query-with-a"

   - Query `b` is "Query-with-a"

   - The formula is "(a/b) * 100 - 5"

   The resulting query would appear as follows: `kubernetes.memory.usage{cluster-name:chi-play};kubernetes.memory.total{cluster-name:chi-play};(a/b) * 100 - 5`

   In the above example, `a` and `b` represent the respective queries:

   - a = `kubernetes.memory.usage{cluster-name:chi-play}`

   - b = `kubernetes.memory.total{cluster-name:chi-play}`

   You can include any number of queries in the final formula using alphabetical variables, such as a, b, c, d, and so on.

- Error messages from health source providers are now included in API responses for improved user experience and debugging efficiency. (OIP-657)

- A new `getAzureKeyVaultClient` API is available to fetch the list of Azure vaults. This option reduces the time it takes for Harness to reflect a newly-created Azure vault. (PL-28392, ZD-44045)

###### Fixed issues

-  Fixed an issue with handling of new line characters in [GitHub App private key files](/docs/platform/connectors/code-repositories/git-hub-app-support) generated on Windows machines. (CI-8708)

- Fixed an issue in Artifactory deployments where the **Artifact Path** pull-down menu would populate even when the Artifactory connector failed to process a regular expression. Now, when a regex is supplied to an artifact tag in the pipeline for a service, the **Artifact Path** menu populates correctly based on the regex. (CDS-72737, ZD-46236)

- Previously, when a fixed value was specified to a pipeline build, the Service step used pattern matching to verify the value.  Now, the Service step verifies the value using an exact match. (CDS-72911)

  For example, suppose the **Jenkins Build** field is set to 1. Previously, the check would pass even if build 1 was absent and build 41 was present. With this fix, the check passes only if build 1 is present.

- Fixed an issue where Helm deployment steps timed out after the initial installation/upgrade phase, preventing the execution of a Helm rollback step. (CDS-73264, ZD-46163)

- Fixed an issue where WinRM deployments would not honor the configured timeout. For example, the step would time out out by default in 30 minutes even when the configured timeout was 1 day. Now, the WinRM session timeout will be set to maximum of step timeout configured and 30 minutes. (CDS-73641, ZD-46904, ZD-48180)

  This fix is behind the feature flag `DISABLE_WINRM_COMMAND_ENCODING`. Contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io) to enable this fix.

- Fixed an issue where the Override Image Connector did not properly configure the image path in the container step. (CDS-73727, ZD-43089, ZD-46916, ZD-47578, ZD-47716)

   This issue has been resolved. The Override Image Connector now correctly configures the image path, including the hostname.

- Fixed an issue where command execution logs were incomplete even though the pipeline ran successfully. This issue was observed when using Command steps in SSH or WinRM deployments. (CDS-74042, ZD-46904)

- Fixed an issue where the Terraform Plan step would exit with code 0 even when there was a change as per the generated plan. This would happen when using the **Export JSON representation of Terraform Plan** option. Now, the step exits with the correct code (2) based on the `terraform plan` command. (CDS-74144, ZD-47379)

- Fixed an issue that resulted in failures when deploying a Tanzu service with a `vars.yaml` file. (CDS-74163, ZD-47412)

  You can now provide routes as variables in your TAS manifest, like this:

  Sample TAS manifest:

  ```yaml
  applications:
  - name: ((NAME))
      memory: 500M
      instances: 1
      routes: ((ROUTES))
  ```
  Sample vars manifest:
  ```yaml
  NAME: harness_<+service.name>_app
  ROUTES:
      - route: route1.apps.tas-harness.com
      - route: route2.apps.tas-harness.com
  ```

- Fixed an issue where users could not use the Blue Green Stage Scale Down step with a manifest kind that was not present in the Kind list used by Harness. Now, the Blue Green Stage Scale Down Step will not fail for unknown manifest kinds. (CDS-74259, ZD-47431)

- Incorrect ordering of execution logs and API call logs. (OIP-661)

   This issue has been resolved. Now, the execution logs and API call logs are displayed in the correct order.

- Earlier, even though you could use the `JAVA_OPTS` environment variable to specify JVM options for the delegate, you could not override the default JVM options that Harness used, namely `-XX:MaxRAMPercentage=70.0` and `-XX:MinRAMPercentage=40.0`. The option to override the defaults was unavailable because the value of JAVA_OPTS was prepended to the default JVM options. (PL-38839)

   This issue has been fixed. The value of JAVA_OPTS is now appended to the default JVM options, thus allowing you to override the default options.

- You were allowed to create resource groups with the same identifier as a built-in resource group. (PL-39503)

  This issue has been fixed. Validation in the API that creates resource groups now checks whether an existing resource group has the same identifier.

- If the delegates that were eligible to execute a pipeline task (delegates that were within the account-organization-project scope of the pipeline and matched any configured delegate selectors) did not have the required tools or connectivity to execute the task, the task timeout message included delegates that did not meet the eligibility criteria. (PL-39624, ZD-46460, ZD-46513)

  This issue has been fixed. The message displayed on task timeout has been improved for scenarios in which no delegate matches specified selectors and no delegates are found in the account.

- Delegates showed high CPU usage caused by a large number of threads that perform read operations being generated and abandoned. (PL-39797)

   This issue has been resolved through improved message read performance and an increased read timeout.

#### July 2023

##### Harness version 79916, Harness Delegate version 23.07.79904

Harness NextGen release 79916 includes the following changes for the Harness Delegate.

###### What's new

- The Splunk connector has been enhanced to include support for Bearer Token. (OIP-598)

- The List Tokens API now supports listing all the personal access tokens or service account tokens in the account. The API has been enhanced as follows:
   1. If you have user management permissions, you can list all the Personal Access Tokens in your account. You can also filter tokens belonging to a user or filter only active tokens.
   2. If you have service account management permissions, you can list all the service account tokens in your account. You can also filter tokens for a service account or filter only active tokens. (PL-31870, ZD-40110)

###### Early access

- Harness added the ability to acquire only the configured maximum number of tasks. This allows Harness Manager to use the task capacity to determine whether to assign a task to the delegate or queue it.

   Delegate task capacity is only supported for CD tasks executed as child processes of a delegate (for example, it does not work for CI builds or CD Container step tasks that spin up new pods).

   You can configure the maximum number of tasks using the Env variable `DELEGATE_TASK_CAPACITY`. For example, if you set `DELEGATE_TASK_CAPACITY` to a value of 2 and execute 6 tasks in parallel, Harness Manager executes only 2 tasks at a time. If you don't configure `DELEGATE_TASK_CAPACITY`, Harness Manager executes all 6 tasks in parallel. (PL-39351)

   This functionality is behind a feature flag, `DELEGATE_TASK_CAPACITY_CHECK`. When the feature flag is enabled, the task is broadcast every minute in Harness Manager until it expires.

###### Fixed issues

- Cron triggers artifact setting failed when modified regex did not match any build. (CDS-72589, ZD-46323)

  Harness initially modifies the regex to see if it matches any build. The trigger was failing if it did not match. Now, if the regex does not match any build, Harness will use the original regex.

- Artifactory artifact source **Artifact Name** regex value was not working correctly. (CDS-73150)

  Harness has added support for regex values for generic type Artifactory artifacts.

- The sort order on the pipelines list page was incorrect. (CDS-73216)

   Now, Harness supports case-insensitive sorting for pipelines, input sets, and pipeline executions.

- The `<+configFile.getAsBase64()>` expression not resolving correctly when the content had new lines. (CDS-73424)

  The issue occurred with newline characters while encoding config files. This is fixed and Harness now replaces newline characters with unicode.

- There was an error collecting metric data when encountering  `null` values returned by metric queries. (OIP-551)

   This issue has been resolved by ignoring null data points and using valid data points in the window.

- The Tokens list page returned a display error when tokens were present and there were multiple pages of results. (PL-36734)

  A code enhancement to reset the pagination on the Tokens list page after any token is deleted fixed this issue. Previously, if you deleted the last token on any page after the first page, the page displayed an empty result list.

- The `listDelegates` API failed when custom selectors were present in the delegate. (PL-39779)

   A code enhancement to update custom tags fixed this issue.

- The listing API failed with an `UnsupportedOperationException` when custom tags were present. Filter APIs failed with NPEs. (PL-39824)

   A code enhancement fixed these issues.

- The delegate token list result from the `DelegateTokenStatus` API endpoint displayed all values as `null`. (PL-39440)

   A code enhancement for the `DelegateTokenStatus` endpoint to return token values even when token details are not fetched by token name fixed this issue. Token values only populate when the user has edit delegate permission. If the user doesn't have edit delegate permission, the value remains `null`.

- The AWS connector widget's prefix field did not accept prefixes starting with a slash. Such slashes were stripped off, and this led to undesired behavior. (PL-39194, ZD-45104)

   Prefixes that begin with a slash are now supported.

- You could not create Azure Key Vault connectors in Harness NextGen even when you used the service principal credentials that successfully created Azure Key Vault connectors in Harness FirstGen. After you entered the service principal credentials, the Vault setup window stopped responding. After several minutes, the following message is displayed: `None of the active delegates were available to complete the task. ==> : 'Missing capabilities: [https:null.vault.azure.net]'` (PL-39783, ZD-46756)

   This issue is now fixed.

##### Version 23.08.79910

###### Hotfix

- The delegate stopped trying to reconnect to the WebSocket if the infrastructure experienced a network outage for over five minutes. (PL-40547)

  This issue is fixed. The delegate keeps trying to reconnect to the WebSocket until it's successful.

##### Version 23.08.79909

###### Hotfix

- The pipeline console did not show any logs to indicate that Kubernetes infrastructure container initialization and completion tasks were in progress.

  Now, to improve your experience, the console shows logs to indicate when the task begins and ends. (CDS-74522, ZD-47616)

##### Version 23.07.79906

###### Hotfix

- Helm deployment steps timed out after the initial installation/upgrade phase, preventing the execution of a Helm rollback step. (CDS-73264)

   This issue is now fixed.

#### June 2023

##### Harness version 79714, Harness Delegate version 23.06.79707

Harness NextGen release 79714 includes the following changes for the Harness Delegate.

###### What's new

- You can now see disconnected delegate details in selection logs and error messages when there are no eligible delegates in an active state to execute tasks. (PL-37900)

- The delegate JRE is upgraded to 11.0.19_7. (PL-37994)

- When a delegate token is revoked, Harness now sends `SELF_DESTRUCT` to all delegates that are using the revoked token. (PL-38957)

###### Early access

- Added a new field in the release history for Blue Green deployments to differentiate between environments. (CDS-69961)

  This is an enhancement to the Kubernetes Blue Green Stage Scale Down step. You can now scale down your last successful stage environment only if the primary resources exist. This enhancement helps you efficiently manage your resources, and prevent deleting the important resources.

  Make sure that the infrastructure definition of these resources and the Blue Green service are the same. This is necessary as Harness identifies resources from the release history, which is mapped to a release name. If you configure a different infrastructure definition, it might lead to scaling down important resources.

###### Fixed issues

- A project-level template crashed when opened. (CDS-71980, ZD-45950)

  The three hyphens, `---` used in the YAML as YAML document separator was being replaced by `---\n` with an empty string due to a logic in the code. This logic made the YAML invalid.

  This issue is fixed by disabling `YAMLGenerator.Feature.WRITE_DOC_START_MARKER` in the YamlUtils to stop the YAML document separator `---` from being added to the YAML.

- Fixed an issue where the applications created outside Harness were deleted during rollback if a Tanzu Application Services (TAS) Rolling deployment failed the first time. (CDS-71397)

- Pipeline execution failed when a variable whose required field is set to `TRUE` is passed as an expression. (CDS-71357, ZD-45615)

  Harness checks for the value of the variable whose required field is set to `TRUE`, and the pipeline failed if the value was empty. This issue occurred when Harness checked for the value of variables that were passed as expressions. The value of expressions cannot be resolved during pipeline creation.

  This issue is fixed by ignoring the check for variables passed as an expression.

- Creating a launch template for an AWS Auto Scale Group (ASG) deployment resulted in a null pointer exception. (CDS-71235)

  This issue is fixed by adding proper validation for the ASG launch template manifest content.

- Improved the error message for pipeline execution failures when running a pipeline that has nested [chained pipelines](/docs/platform/pipelines/pipeline-chaining/). (CDS-69578, ZD-44443)
- CloudFormation deployment failed with an unclear error message, `# Exception: Invalid request: Template format error: YAML not well-formed. (line 1, column 40) (Service: AmazonCloudFormation; Status Code: 400; Error Code: ValidationError; Request ID: 7685da0b-c14a-47e2-afe5-9e4ffde536c6; Proxy: null) while Updating stack: pipeline-demo.`. (CDS-68866, ZD-44165)

  When a multi-line string was passed as input for a child pipeline, the string was being converted to a single line.

  This issue is fixed. Instead of passing data using YAML, Harness now uses JSON for data processing. This helps preserve multi-line strings and YAML structures properly to process pipeline YAML and user inputs.

- Fixed an issue where the expression, `<+lastPublished.tag>.regex()` was not resolved properly when used as runtime input for artifacts. (CDS-68810)

- Quotations were added to execution YAML strings inconsistently when comparing pipeline YAMLs. (CDS-67637)

  This issue is fixed by enabling `MINIMIZE_QUOTES` for YamlUtils and YamlPipelineUtils classes. The compiled YAML no longer has quotations around strings where they are not needed, but only around numbers. Even if you had added quotations in the string values in the pipeline YAML, they'll be removed in the compiled YAML. Also, there won't be unnecessary audit trails where the diff only has quotations around strings.

- Account-level connectors with resource groups set to **Specified** were not available at the project-level. (PL-38828)

   This issue is now fixed. The connectors list shows the connectors for which users have resource group permissions set.

- The account-level **Session Timeout (in minutes)** allowed values greater than the 4320 minute maximum. (PL-32498)

   This issue has been resolved by adding a code validation. The field no longer accepts values above 4320 minutes.

##### Harness version 79516, Harness Delegate version 23.06.79503

Harness NextGen release 79516 includes the following changes for the Harness Delegate.

###### What's new

- Send emails to non-Harness users. (CDS-58625, ZD-42496)

  To send emails to non-Harness users, you must configure your own SMTP server and enable the **Enable Emails to be sent to non-Harness Users** default setting. This setting is available at Account, Org, and Project levels.

  For more information on how to send emails to non-Harness users, go to [Email step reference](/docs/continuous-delivery/x-platform-cd-features/cd-steps/utilities/email_step/).

- Converted Harness CD from an explicit to an implicit change source for Service Reliability Management. (SRM-14724)

###### Early access

- Scale down the last successful stage environment created by using a Blue Green Deployment strategy. (CDS-68527)

  This functionality helps you efficiently manage your resources. The scale down step can be configured within the same stage or different stage based on your requirement.

  During scale down, the `HorizontalPodAutoscaler` and `PodDisruptionBudget` resources are removed, and the Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets and Deployment Configs resources are scaled down. Make sure that the infrastructure definition of these resources and the Blue Green service are the same. This is necessary as Harness identifies resources from the release history, which is mapped to a release name. If you configure a different infrastructure definition, it might lead to scaling down important resources.

- Kubernetes deployments support `HorizontalPodAutoscaler` and `PodDisruptionBudget` for Blue Green and Canary execution strategies. (CDS-59011)

  This functionality is behind a feature flag, `CDS_SUPPORT_HPA_AND_PDB_NG`.

###### Fixed issues

- Enhanced handling and logging for the `No enum constant io.harness.delegate.message.MessengerType.WATCHEIN` exception to enable the actual malformed message. This error indicates that a message is malformed and only occurs when there is an error during writing, for example, out of disk, process killed, etc. (PL-38245)

- Unable to create SLO using SignalFX metrics. (OIP-406)

  This issue has been resolved. Now, SignalFX's health source supports SLI functionality, and you can create SLOs using SignalFX metrics.

- Fixed an issue where Harness was unable to retrieve the Git status or push updates to Azure repos with project names with white spaces. (CI-8105, ZD-44679)

  This issue is fixed.

- Spot Elastigroup deployments failed to fetch instance health and expired. (CDS-56451, ZD-41436)

  Harness improved the handling mechanism for the Spot `instanceHealthiness` API to fix this issue.

- A force delete option appeared when deleting a template referenced by another template. This deleted the referenced template, but the remaining versions were no longer visible on the UI. (CDS-68683)

  Added additional test coverage for some workflows to resolve this issue.

- Fixed an issue where error logs were removed to stop error flooding into GCP logs when Git authentication fails. (CDS-68760)

- Fixed an issue where strings were interpreted as scientific notations. (CDS-69063, ZD-44206)

- Input values needed in steps or stages for execution failed with the error: `Cannot update execution status for the PlanExecution [execution Id] with RUNNING`. (CDS-69342, ZD-44344)

  This error occurred when converting YAML to JSON. A code enhancement fixed this issue. With this enhancement, quotes inside the field YAML are escaped, resulting in valid YAML.

- The pipeline execution error message for YAML related errors was unclear. (CDS-69576)

  Improved error message handling for YAML processing failures. The error message now display files that contain errors and points to the problematic part of the file.

- Bamboo triggers were not working properly. (CDS-69605)

  Adding the Bamboo build to the delegate response resolved this issue.

- Certificate issues in Harness Delegate version 23.05.79307. (CDS-70410, ZD-45105, ZD-45110, ZD-45128)

  The HTTP step was failing due to absence of the `certificate` value in the step. In previous delegate versions, the delegate would bypass the absence of this field. However, in delegate version 23.05.79307, this field was incorrectly set as mandatory for HTTP step execution for validations against servers that had self-signed certificates. This issue is fixed.

- Fixed an issue where the `eventPayload` expressions were not resolving when rerunning a failed pipeline that was previously fired by using a trigger. (CDS-70559)

#### May 2023

##### Harness version 79306, Harness Delegate version 23.05.79307

Harness NextGen release 79306 includes the following changes for the Harness Delegate.

###### What's new

- Added support to provide quartz cron expressions for scheduled triggers. (CDS-59261, CDS-59260)

- Added support for accessing connector attributes for Deployment Templates. (CDS-54247)

  The connector attributes for Secret Manager connectors can be accessed in Deployment Templates using the following expressions.

  * [AWS KMS](/docs/platform/secrets/secrets-management/add-an-aws-kms-secrets-manager): `<+infra.variables.AwsKms.spec.credential.type>`
  * [AWS Secrets Manager](/docs/platform/secrets/secrets-management/add-an-aws-secret-manager): `<+infra.variables.AwsSecretsManager.spec.region>`
  * [Azure Key Vault](/docs/platform/secrets/secrets-management/azure-key-vault): `<+infra.variables.AzureKeyVault.spec.vaultName>`
  * [Google KMS](/docs/platform/secrets/secrets-management/add-google-kms-secrets-manager): `<+infra.variables.GcpKms.spec.keyName>`
  * [Google Cloud secret manager](/docs/platform/secrets/secrets-management/add-a-google-cloud-secret-manager): `<+infra.variables.GcpSecMan.spec.credentialsRef.identifier>`
  * [Custom secret manager](/docs/platform/secrets/secrets-management/custom-secret-manager): `<+infra.variables.CustomSecMan.spec.isDefault>`
  * [HashiCorp Vault](/docs/platform/secrets/secrets-management/add-hashicorp-vault): `<+infra.variables.HashiCorp.spec.vaultUrl>`

- Git polling tasks for triggers are executed on the same delegate selector used in the Git connector. (CDS-58115)

  Previously, triggers used the round robin algorithm to select any available delegate within a project or account. Now, the delegate-based trigger polling selects the same delegate you used in the connectors for triggers.

- The Azure Key Vault secret manager now supports creating secrets with expiration dates. Select **Expires On** to set a secret expiration date. (PL-32708, ZD-42524)

###### Early access

- New delegate metrics are available. This functionality is behind a feature flag, `DYNAMIC_REQUEST_HANDLING`. (PL-37908, PL-38538)

   Harness captures delegate agent metrics for delegates shipped on immutable image types. The following new delegate agent metrics are available with the feature flag:

   | **Metric name** | **Description** |
   | :-- | :-- |
   | `io_harness_custom_metric_task_rejected` | The number of tasks rejected because of a high load on the delegate. |
   | `io_harness_custom_metric_resource_consumption_above_threshold` | Delegate cpu/memory is above a threshold (defaults to 80%). Provide `DELEGATE_RESOURCE_THRESHOLD` as the env variable in the delegate YAML to configure the threshold. |

   Enable the feature flag, `DYNAMIC_REQUEST_HANDLING` to use the new delegate agent metrics. When this feature flag is enabled, Harness will capture the metrics. For more information, go to [Configure delegate metrics](/docs/platform/delegates/manage-delegates/delegate-metrics/).

###### Fixed issues

- Fixed an issue where the expressions of tags were not rendered properly. (CDS-68703, ZD-43797)

- Executions were failing with `Canary failed: [Canary Deployment failed - NoSuchMethodError: org.yaml.snakeyaml.constructor.SafeConstructor: method 'void <init>()' not found ]` error message. (CDS-68293, ZD-43753, ZD-43769)

  The Fabric8 library used by Harness is upgraded from version 5.x to 6.x. Harness was explicitly using snake.yaml version 2.x due to vulnerabilities present in the 1.x version.

  Harness' usages of Fabric8 library were throwing the above mentioned because Fabric8 library version 5.12.1 uses the old snake.yaml library version 1.x.

  Customers who were using the following were affected:
    - FirstGen Kubernetes deployments that contain Istio's VirtualService/DestinationRule objects.
    - FirstGen Traffic Split step.
    - FirstGen Native Helm deployments with Kubernetes cluster version 1.16 or earlier.
    - NextGen Kubernetes deployments that contain Istio's VirtualService/DestinationRule objects.
    - NextGen Native Helm deployments with Kubernetes cluster version 1.16 or earlier.

  This change does not create any behavioral changes.

- The access denied exception was saving the OAuth secret in the Harness Source Code Manager (SCM) user profile. (CDS-68144)

  This issue is fixed by passing the context correctly from the SCM service to the Git service.

- Pipelines with multi-level templates displayed Java errors because a secret was referenced by another secret. (CDS-68094)

  This issue is fixed in by improving the error messages.

- Fixed an issue by eliminating NPE during ASG pipeline execution. (CDS-59383)

- The Canary Delete step during rollback did not delete all canary resources when the forward Canary Delete step expired. The Canary Delete step uses Harness release history when the Canary Deployment step expires. An API call issue prevented Harness release history from being updated in time and available for the Canary Delete step during rollback. (CDS-58702)

   This issue has been resolved. The Canary Delete step now properly deletes canary workloads when the forward Canary Deployment step expires.

- Fixed an issue by adding support for retrying `sockettimeoutExceptions` as they can occur due to intermittent issues during a Kubernetes deployment. (CDS-57688)

- Invites to users fail with an unauthorized error while RBAC setup is still in progress. (PL-32117)

  A polling system ensures that RBAC setup has been completed.

- Custom Secret Manager creation does not consider the delegate selector. (PL-32260)

  In Custom SM configuration, decrypting secrets using the SSH connection to validate delegate selection fixed this issue.

- Deployments consistently failed during the same stage. (PL-38247, ZD-42721)

   This issue was fixed by updating the delegate YAML. Delegate startup now fails when you use a legacy delegate image with an immutable delegate.

#### April 2023

##### Harness version 79111, Harness Delegate version 23.04.79106

Harness NextGen release 79111 includes the following changes for the Harness Delegate.

    - org.springframework.boot:spring-boot from 2.3.2.RELEASE -> 2.7.10

- Added APIs to enable auto upgrading with custom delegate images. (DEL-6183)

    - `SupportedDelegateVersion` returns the maximum delegate version number to install.
    - `overrideDelegateImageTag` changes the tag the upgrader uses to upgrade delegates when auto upgrade is on.

- Upgraded the following libraries: (DEL-6198)

    - org.springframework:spring-aop from 5.3.23 -> 5.3.26
    - org.springframework:spring-beans from 5.3.25 -> 5.3.26
    - org.springframework:spring-context from 5.3.25 -> 5.3.26
    - org.springframework:spring-core from 5.3.25 -> 5.3.26
    - org.springframework:spring-expression from 5.3.25 -> 5.3.26
    - org.springframework:spring-jcl from 5.3.25 -> 5.3.26
    - org.springframework:spring-messaging from 5.3.25 -> 5.3.26

    - org.springframework:spring-tx from 5.3.25 -> 5.3.26
    - org.springframework:spring-web from 5.3.25 -> 5.3.26

###### Fixed issues

- Added WebSocket reconnect logic for when the Harness Manager does not receive a heartbeat from the Harness Delegate for more than five minutes. (DEL-5954)

- Set the delegate `LANG` environment variable to en_US.UTF-8 by default. (DEL-6221)

#### March 2023

##### Harness version 78914, Harness Delegate version 23.03.78904

Harness release 78914 includes the following changes for the Harness Delegate.

###### What's new

- Added support for the latest Git CLI in the delegate maximal image. (DEL-6121)
  - The latest Git CLI is now included by default.

###### Fixed issues

This release does not include any fixed issues.

##### Harness version 78817, Harness Delegate version 23.03.78705

Harness NextGen release 78817 includes the following changes for the Harness Delegate.

###### Fixed issues

Minor fixes to the delegate installation wizard. (DEL-6073)

Previously, Helm was not pre-selected when you switched from Docker to Kubernetes. This has been fixed. Additionally, values that need to be copied in the Kubernetes manifest were moved into a copy block.

##### Harness version 78712, Harness Delegate version 23.03.78705

Harness NextGen release 78712 includes the following changes for the Harness Delegate.

###### What's new

- Integrated **Logs** API in the **Executed Details** page where the delegate task ID is available. (DEL-6035)

  You can now view logs for delegate tasks for pipeline steps that are running or finished. This can help with debugging issues.

- Set an expiry for delegate tokens. (DEL-5652)

  When you create a delegate token through APIs, you can provide an optional parameter `revokeAfter`. This is the epoch time in milliseconds after which the token is marked as revoked. There can be a delay of up to one hour from when the epoch value is provided to when the token is revoked.

###### Fixed issues

A pipeline stalled with only one ServiceNow task running. (DEL-6042)

This issue was fixed with the following updates:

- Tasks that were never assigned to a delegate explicitly fail after 4 successful broadcast attempts per delegate, to all eligible delegates in the account.
- Fail one minute after the last rebroadcast attempt.

##### Harness version 78619, Harness Delegate version 23.03.78500

Harness NextGen release 78619 includes the following changes for the Harness Delegate.

###### What's new

- The delegate installation UI experience is now updated with a new installation method: the Terraform Helm provider. Also, the installation experience has been enhanced for the existing methods (Helm chart, Kubernetes manifest, and Docker). This new experience is more developer friendly. For example, it enables cutting and pasting of relevant commands. You can also automate the commands and use new values when necessary.

  Additionally, the following new features are available:
    - The **Terraform Helm Provider** method is based on the open source [Terraform Harness Delegate module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/harness/harness-delegate/kubernetes/latest) and the open source [Harness Delegate Helm chart](https://github.com/harness/delegate-helm-chart). Auto upgrade is set to `OFF` with an option to enable it in the command.
    - The updated method for **Helm Chart** is also based on the same open source [Harness Delegate Helm chart](https://github.com/harness/delegate-helm-chart) as the Terraform Helm provider. Auto upgrade is set to OFF with an option to enable it in the command. You can also download the [default values.yaml](https://github.com/harness/delegate-helm-chart/blob/main/harness-delegate-ng/values.yaml) for the Helm option and edit that to set your own long-lived configuration values.
    - The updated flow for **Kubernetes Manifest** has the following options for creating a manifest YAML file specific to your Harness account.
      - **Basic**: Provides a **Download YAML** option. The downloaded YAML has all the configuration variables set to values that are specific to your Harness account.
      - **Custom** - Create your own YAML from a [Kubernetes manifest template](https://github.com/harness/delegate-kubernetes-manifest/blob/main/harness-delegate.yaml) by replacing the placeholders with the values provided in the method.
      Given the need to have a fully qualified YAML, the auto upgrade configuration is set to ON in both the above options. Consequently, the delegate version that is installed always remains in sync with the version available on Harness Manager.
    - The **Docker** delegate installation method has now been simplified to a copy-and-paste action on the `docker run` command, with the option to modify the preset values. The auto upgrade is set to OFF for this method, with an option to enable it in the command. (DEL-6037)

- The secrets manager cache was moved from Redis to the Harness Manager's local pod. (DEL-5884)

   This move further enhances security because the secrets manager configuration no longer goes outside of the Harness Manager's pod.

###### Fixed issues

The new delegate installation wizard is now available in all delegate installation workflows. (DEL-5989)

#### February 2023

##### Harness version 78507, Harness Delegate version 23.02.78500

Harness NextGen release 78507 includes the following changes for the Harness Delegate.

:::info note
The repository location of the Helm chart for the NextGen delegate is changing. (DEL-5576)

:::

###### What's new

This release introduces the following new features and enhancements:

You can dynamically select delegates by hostname during pipeline runs. To do so, select delegates by hostname from your delegate groups. (DEL-5052)

###### Fixed issues

- Fixed an issue that interfered with the delegate installation process. Delegate API requests did not include the context that was required; organization and project ID information was not being sent with requests. The required context is now included. (DEL-5951)

##### Harness version 78421, Harness Delegate 23.02.version 78306

Harness NextGen release 78421 includes the following changes for the Harness Delegate.

:::info note

:::

###### What's new

This release introduces the following new features and enhancements:

- Added the `helm repo update` command to the delegate installer. The command is included in the instructions that apply the delegate manifest. This change reduces the chance of retrieving the wrong file from the repository. (DEL-5540)

###### Fixed issues

- Resolved a problem that caused SCM log information to be displayed in the Watcher. The information was redirected to the delegate `slf4j` stream for display in the delegate logs. (DEL-5744)

##### Harness version 78321, Harness Delegate version 23.02.78306

Harness NextGen release 78321 includes the following changes for the Harness Delegate.

:::note
The repository location of the Helm chart for the NextGen delegate is changing. (DEL-5576)

The repository is being deprecated. Updates to the chart will not be made to https://app.harness.io/storage/harness-download/delegate-helm-chart/ and will not be available from that location. To ensure retrieval of the most recent Helm chart, update your repository references to https://app.harness.io/storage/harness-download/harness-helm-charts/.
:::

###### What's new

This release introduces the following new features and enhancements:

- A REST-based operation to fetch a delegate token value was introduced. The operation requires the Harness user role permission `Delegate: Create/Edit`. For information about other delegate token operations, see [Delegate Token Resource](https://apidocs.harness.io/tag/Delegate-Token-Resource). (DEL-5634)

- The delegate installation UI was changed to include the `helm repo update harness` command as an option on the **Apply YAML and verify connection** page. Use this option to obtain the latest version information on the charts in the Harness Helm repository. For more information about the `update` command, see [Helm Repo Update](https://v3-1-0.helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_repo_update/) in the Helm Docs. (DEL-5540)

###### Fixed issues

- Added error checking to ensure that delegates immediately reject tasks that are not supported. (DEL-5602)

###### Security enhancements

This release introduces the following security enhancements:

- The immutable delegate image was refreshed with updated versions of client tools. This reduces security vulnerabilities for the delegate and enhances security. The following table details the updates. (DEL-5688)

  | **Third-party tool** | **78101 and earlier** | **78306 and later** |
  | :-- | :-: | :-: |
  | kubectl | 1.13.2, 1.19.2 | 1.24.3 |
