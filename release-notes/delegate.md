### New features and enhancements

This release introduces the following new features and enhancements:

Use this option to obtain the latest version information on the charts in the Harness Helm repository. For more information about the `update` command, see [Helm Repo Update](https://v3-1-0.helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_repo_update/) in the Helm Docs. (DEL-5540)
