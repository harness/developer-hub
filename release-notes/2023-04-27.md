#### Admin API Keys Enhancements
  ##### Clone API Keys
  Users can now [clone API Keys](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360019916211#cloning-api-keys) with the same access levels and scope as the key that is cloned. This will enable users to securely change/rotate keys on a regular basis while eliminating manual work.
  #### SDK Enhancements
  ##### TLS support
  Split now supports TLS encryption for [Split Synchronizer](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360019686092-Split-Synchronizer#cli-configuration-options-and-its-equivalents-in-json--environment-variables) and [Split Proxy](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/4415960499213-Split-Proxy#cli-configuration-options-and-its-equivalents-in-json-and-environment-variables) endpoints. This will enable developers to further secure their SDK traffic.
