#### Feature Flag Management Console 
##### Flag Sets 
With [Flag Sets](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/22256278916621-Using-flag-sets-to-boost-SDK-performance), users can group flags that logically belong together, so that the SDK only retrieves relevant flag definitions when initialized. This reduces SDK latency, memory consumption, and CPU utilization.
