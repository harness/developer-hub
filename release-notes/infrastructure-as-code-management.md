In the new UI, go to **Account Settings**, **Account Details**, **General**, **Account Details**, and then **Platform Service Versions**.

## March 2024
### Version 0.178.0
<!-- Released on: 25 March 2024 -->
#### New features and enhancements
  - **Connector Validation Enhancement:** We've implemented a validation check for connectors when creating or editing workspaces. This update ensures that all connectors used are currently available and of the correct type before proceeding with the operation, to help prevent errors related to non-existent or incorrect type connectors, enhancing the reliability and efficiency of workspace management. (IAC-1602)

### Version 0.176.0
<!-- Released on: 21 March 2024 -->
#### New features and enhancements
  - **Enhanced Lock Icon Tooltips and Warnings:** We've updated the tooltips and warning messages for the **lock icon** in Workspace resources to improve clarity and accessibility. (IAC-1577)

### Version 0.175.0
<!-- Released on: 15 March 2024 -->
#### Fixed issues
  - **Improved Header Visibility:** We resolved the issue of overlapping headers in side-by-side workspace state comparisons, enhancing readability and accessibility for the **View Execution** and **filename** headers. (IAC-1573)
  - **Planned Changes Count Accuracy:** We refined the **Planned changes** count to include only **Added, Changed, and Deleted** resources, excluding **Unchanged** resources, for a more accurate reflection of significant changes. (IAC-1561)

## February 2024
### Version 0.152.0
<!-- Released on: 08 February 2024 -->
#### Fixed issues
- **Improved Variable Deletion Permissions:** Fixed an oversight where permissions for variable deletion were not checked during workspace updates. Previously, checks were only performed via the */variable* endpoint using the **DELETE method**. This update ensures that permissions are verified against both the individual deletions and the broader workspace variable updates, maintaining security without modifying the core architecture between **iac-server** and **sprox**.
