#### SDK Enhancements
##### SDK Offline Mode from JSON
Developers can now start their [Java SDK](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360020405151-Java-SDK#json) instance in localhost mode, and easily download SDK data in the form of JSON files with just one command. These files can then mimic test or production environments, helping to improve the testing of applications offline.
