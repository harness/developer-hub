## April 6, 2023, version 1.43.1

### New features

This release does not include new features.

### Early access features

This release does not include early access features.

### Fixed Issues

* Fixed a UI issue in **External Tickets Settings** for setting up Jira integrations:  **Default Project** and **Default Issue Type** always used the account-level Jira connector, even when a different connector was selected for the current project or organization. (STO-5756)
* Fixed a search issue in **Security Tests**: If a search term included certain special characters, the UI would fail with a JavaScript exception. (STO-5745) 

## March 30, 2023, version 1.40.2

### New features

* The Snyk integration has been updated. Orchestrated Snyk scans now upload results to the external Snyk portal by default. (STO-5607)

### Early access features

* This release includes the following enhancements to the [Jira integration](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/use-sto/view-and-troubleshoot-vulnerabilities/jira-integrations):
   * After you create a new ticket, **Issue Details** replaces the **Create Ticket** button with a link to the new ticket and the ticket status. (STO-5518)

     Before:

     ![](./static/sto-jira-ticket-create-BEFORE.png)

     After:

     ![](./static/sto-jira-ticket-create-AFTER.png)

   **External Tickets** now automatically populates the **Default Project Name** and **Default Project Type** menus based on the selected ticket-provider connector. (STO-5492)

### Fixed Issues

* Fixed an issue with SonarQube scans: if a repository had a .gitignore with a specific pattern, all files were ignored during the scan. (STO-5711)
* Fixed an issue with Snyk scans to ensure that **Issue Details** shows all remediation information from the scan results under Remediation. (STO-5663)
* Fixed an issue where, if a scan detected no issues and a later scan detected one or more issues, **Issue Details** would include remediation information from the later scan. (STO-5463)
*  Fixed a UI issue where the **Security Tests** tab was incorrectly showing issue counts and the Ignored status for some issues. This was due to a DB query that caused exemptions scoped to an issue in one project to be applied to the same issue in all projects in the account. (STO-5718)


## March 23, 2023

* Fixed an issue in **Security Tests** &gt; **Overview** where the **Issue distribution over time** graph was empty for some projects. (STO-5318)


## March 14, 2023

### New Features

This release includes a set of new scanner-specific steps (step palettes) for Aqua Trivy, Bandit, SonarQube, and other popular scanners. These steps greatly simplify the process of setting up scans in your pipelines. Previously, the workflow for all scanners was to enter a set of hard-coded key and value strings in a Security step. These new steps have simplified user-friendly UIs that include only the options relevant to the specific scanner, mode, and target.

The following security steps are now generally available:

* [Aqua Trivy](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/sto-techref-category/aqua-trivy-scanner-reference) (STO-5393)
* [Bandit](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/sto-techref-category/bandit-scanner-reference) (STO-5050)
* [Black Duck Hub](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/sto-techref-category/black-duck-hub-scanner-reference) (STO-5052)
* [Checkmarx](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/sto-techref-category/checkmarx-scanner-reference) (STO-5073)
* [Grype](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/sto-techref-category/grype-scanner-reference) (STO-5394)
* [Mend (formerly Whitesource)](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/sto-techref-category/mend-scanner-reference) (STO-5392)
* [Prisma Cloud (formerly Twistlock)](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/sto-techref-category/prisma-cloud-scanner-reference) (STO-5055)
* [Snyk](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/sto-techref-category/snyk-scanner-reference) (STO-5053)
* [SonarQube](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/sto-techref-category/sonarqube-sonar-scanner-reference) (STO-5051)
* [Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/sto-techref-category/zap-scanner-reference) (STO-5058)

### Early access features

This release does not include early access features.

### Fixed Issues

This release does not include fixed issues.

## March 9, 2023

### New features

This release does not include new features.

### Early access features

* The new [Jira integration](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/use-sto/view-and-troubleshoot-vulnerabilities/jira-integrations) has been enhanced. If an issue has an associated Jira ticket, **Issue Details** now shows the ticket status along with the number. (STO-5491)

### Fixed Issues

* Fixed an issue in the Jira integration to ensure that **Create Ticket** now appears in **Issue Details**, even if an issue has an Exemption associated with it. (STO-5526)
* Fixed an issue in the Jira integration that allowed users to try to create tickets against targets with no baseline specified, which is not supported and resulted in a 404 response. (STO-5477)
* Fixed an issue in the Back Duck configuration UI where the in-tool help said that the Image Region setting was required when scanning AWS ECR container images. This field is optional. (STO-5450)

## March 2, 2023, version v1.32.1 

### New features

- The Twistlock integration has been upgraded to use version 22.12.582. (STO-5575)
- The Brakeman, Nikto, and Nmap scanner integrations now enable you to customize scans by passing CLI arguments to the scanner via the `tool_args` setting. (STO-5465)
- The Bandit scanner integration now enables you to customize scans by passing CLI arguments to the scanner via the `tool_args` setting. (STO-5415)
- The Mend integration now supports SCA scans. (STO-5242)
- Bandit scan results have been enhanced. When you open the Details pane for a detected issue, the Raw Details JSON now includes links to further information under `_rawIssueCwe : link` and `_rawMoreInfo`. (STO-5422)
- The Security Testing Dashboard includes a new set of filters for drilling down into specific issues by project, creation date, scanner, target, pipeline, severity, and so on. You can drill down to a set of relevant issues and then click on a pie slice, chart element, or other UI element to view details on the relevant issues. (STO-5329)
  
  Note the following:

  - The Security Testing Dashboard requires an Enterprise account.
  - You must click **Refresh** (top right) to apply the filter after you configure it.
  - To view details for an issue from the search results, click the pipeline name or ID and choose **View in Harness Platform**. 

    ![](./static/sto-dashboard-view-issue-in-harness-platform.png)

  - The **Created Date** menu has several non-working options: `is null`, `is not null`, and `matches a user attribute`. This is a known issue that Harness is working to address.

![Security Testing Dashboard -- filters and Refresh button](static/sto-dashboard-with-new-filters.png)


### Early access features

- Improved UI for configuring scan steps (STO-4867)
  
  This release includes a set of Security steps with an improved UI for configuring scans. Each step shows only the settings that apply to the specific scan. 

  Note the following:

  - This release includes new steps for the following scanners: Aqua Trivy, Bandit, Black Duck, Checkmarx, Grype, Mend, Prisma Cloud, Snyk, SonarQube, and ZAP.  
  - Docker-in-Docker is no longer required for these steps *unless* you're scanning a container image. If you're scanning a repository or running instance, you don't need to set up a Background step running DinD.    
  - These steps are currently available in Security stages only. 
  - Support is currently limited to Kubernetes and Harness Cloud AMD64 build infrastructures only.
  - For descriptions of all available UI settings, go to [Security step UI settings reference](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/sto-techref-category/security-step-ui-settings-reference).

## February 24, 2023

### New features

This release does not include new features.

### Fixed issues

* Fixed a race condition allowing for duplicate targets to get created. (STO-5481)


## February 16, 2023

### New features

This release does not include new features.

### Fixed issues

## January 29, 2023	

### New features

* You can now ingest results from a specific Checkmarx scan. This option is useful for ensuring that a pipeline ingests the scan triggered by a specific event. Add the setting `product_scan_id` = `MY_SCAN_ID` to the Checkmarx step. This overrides the default behavior, which is to ingest results for the most recent scan. (STO-5424)	

* You can now enable debug-level logging for Snyk and Aqua Trivy scans. To do this, add this setting to the scan step: `log_level` = `debug`. (STO-5405)

* Grype scans now support a `tool_args` field. You can use this field to run the plugin with specific command-line arguments. To scan all layers in an image, for example, add this setting to the Grype scan step: `tool_args` = `--scope all-layers`. (STO-5400)

* To make **Issue Details** easier to navigate, Raw Details JSON data is now collapsed by default. (STO-5398)	


### Fixed issues

* Fixed an issue that caused a scheduled AWS ECR scan to time out or to terminate with a status of Invalid. (STO-5449)	


## January 15, 2023		

### New features

* Aqua Trivy scans now support a `tool_args` field. You can use this field to run the plugin with specific command-line arguments. To run an offline scan, for example, specify `tool_args` = `---offline-scan`. (STO-5388)	

### Fixed issues

* Fixed an issue where, in some situations, the severity and severity code of a detected issue were not updated when new occurrences of the same issue were detected. (STO-4809)	


## January 8, 2023		

### New features

* Checkmarx scans now support a `tool_args` field. You can use this field to run the Checkmarx plugin with specific command-line arguments. To run an incremental scan, for example, specify `tool_args` = `-incremental`. (STO-5041)	

* STO now supports orchestrated scans using [Grype](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/sto-techref-category/grype-scanner-reference). (STO-5161)	

### Fixed issues

This release does not include fixed issues.

## January 1, 2023	

### New features

* The Issues Details pane has been revised to make it easier to navigate. Raw JSON data now appears at the bottom of each occurrence and is collapsed by default. (STO-4839)	

### Fixed issues

This release does not include fixed issues.


## December 18, 2022			

### New features

* Remediated issues are no longer included in the issue counts logged near the end of a Security Step run and provided as output variables. (STO-5304)	

*  With this release, you can run a SonarQube scan and specify a collection of SSL certificates rather than a single certificate. This option is useful when you don't know which specific certificate in a collection is required by the server. (STO-5243)	

### Fixed issues

* Fixed an issue where `product_lookup_type` being set to `byTokens` causes the step to perform a Dataload instead of OrchestratedScan. (STO-5166)	


## December 11, 2023			

### New features
	
* STO is now supported on Linux (amd64 and arm64 platforms) in [Harness Cloud](/docs/continuous-integration/ci-quickstarts/hosted-builds-on-virtual-machines-quickstart). (STO-5314)	

* Instead of using Service Dependencies for Docker-in-Docker configuration, users should use new Background steps. (STO-5268)

### Fixed issues

This release does not include fixed issues.


## December 4, 2023			

### New features

This release does not include new features.

### Fixed issues

* Fixed an issue that resulted in intermittent failures with OWASP orchestrated scans. (STO-5289)	


## November 28, 2023			
	

### New features

This release does not include new features.	

### Fixed issues

* Fixed an issue where the Security Tests tab on the Pipeline Execution page was periodically reloading in a visually jarring way and losing scroll position. (STO-5208)

* Fixed an issue where the Security Tests tab would show previously-found issues as "remediated" while the scan was in progress.  (STO-4985)	

* Improved the Security Tests UI to highlight new issues found in the current target only vs. issues also found in the baseline, or in the previous scan if no baseline was specified. (STO-5198)	


## November 6, 2023	

### New features

* You can now include Run steps in Security Test stages. You can also include Security Tests stages in STO pipelines without a CI license. (STO-5208)

* You can now configure a pipeline to ingest Snyk data from multiple files and paths. For an example of how to set this up, go to [Ingest Scan Results from Snyk](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/use-sto/orchestrate-and-ingest/snyk-scans). (STO-4958)	

### Fixed issues

* Fixed an issue where the issue counts reported in output variables vs. the Security Tests page were inconsistent for scans of target baselines, or for targets with no specified baseline. (STO-5042)	


## October 31, 2022

### What's New

- New output variables – This release includes a new set of output variables you can use to determine the next stage of your pipeline. These variables show the number of new issues detected in the current scan compared to the last scan. If this is the first scan for the target, these variables reflect new issues compared to the baseline. You can use these variables to determine the next stage of your pipeline:
  - NEW_CRITICAL
  - NEW_HIGH
  - NEW_MEDIUM
  - NEW_LOW
  - NEW_UNASSIGNED (Reserved for future use)
  - NEW_TOTAL (STO-4866)
- STO Overview – The STO Overview provides a single, interactive view of all baseline issues detected by all scans in your project. A time series chart shows the daily distribution of issues by severity over the past 30 or 90 days. A daily snapshot shows the sum of all baseline issues based on the latest scan of each baseline. You can also drill down into active, failed, and in-progress baseline scans. (STO-3629)
- STO scans on VMs using Docker delegates – You can now run builds with STO scans using Docker delegates running on Linux VMs in AWS and other cloud platforms. This extends the support for STO scans with Kubernetes delegates.
  For information about setting up a VM build infrastructure, see Set Up Build Infrastructure in the CI docs. (STO-4639)
- Two-step Exemption and Security Review – This release enhances support for a two-step process for requesting and approving security exemptions:
  - Developers can request (but not approve) exemptions to unblock pipeline builds for specific issues.
  - Only SecOps users can approve exemption requests and choose to mute or ignore specific issues. (STO-4479)
- AWS Security Hub – STO now supports scans in AWS Security Hub. (STO-4873)
- AWS ECR – STO now supports scans on AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR). (STO-4969)
