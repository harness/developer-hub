##### Early access

This release does not include early access features.

##### Fixed issues

##### Feature Flags SDKs

* The **Erlang** server SDK has been updated to version **2.0.1** with the following update.

  * Some SDK dependencies were not included in releases created by `mix`. This issue has been fixed. (FFM-8364)

* The **Android** client SDK has been updated to version **1.1.1** with the following updates.

  * Removed the following error, which is reported by Gradle's Lint task. (FFM-8551)

    `checkClientTrusted is empty, which could cause insecure network traffic due to trusting arbitrary TLS/SSL certificates presented by peers`

  * Added `Harness-SDK-Info`, `Harness-EnvironmentID` and `Harness-AccountID` HTTP headers to outbound HTTP connections. (FFM-7037)

* The **iOS** client SDK has been updated to version **1.1.0** with the following updates.

  * The following methods now have an alternative overloaded version that allows you to get the result of the flag directly in the return value, without the need to provide a closure block. (FFM-8056)

    * stringVariation()
    * boolVariation()
    * numberVariation()
    * jsonVariation()

  * Added TLS support for custom/private certs in the iOS SDK for config, stream and metric endpoints. (FFM-7015)

    The CfConfigurationBuilder now has new methods for taking a list of X.509 certificate authority (CA) certs. This list must also include any intermediate CAs the Apple security APIs may need to resolve the full trust chain. 

    For custom certificates, you must also ensure that the Subject Alternative Names (SANs) are set up correctly in the CA for domain name validation to pass.

    The new function setTlsTrustedCAs() takes a list of X.509 CA certificates in PEM format, which will be used to verify the server's web cert sent during TLS handshake. Each PEM certificate must include the BEGIN/END CERTIFICATE headers.

  * Made the following improvements. (FFM-8045)

    *  Added standardized SDK error codes for events such as initialization, authentications, etc. For a full list, go to [Troubleshooting](/docs/feature-flags/ff-sdks/client-sdks/ios-sdk-reference#troubleshooting).
    * Added general improvements to logging statements, reducing verbose logging to the console. 
    * Added support for configurable custom loggers. For code examples, go to the [SDK repository](https://github.com/harness/ff-ios-client-sdk/blob/main/docs/further_reading.md#custom-loggers).

  * Added retries for the authentication, and other endpoints. Network timeouts and certain HTTP error codes will be retried with a random delay up to 3 times. (FFM-8049)

  * Added a new API, refreshEvaluations(), that can be called by a mobile app coming to the foreground to update any SSE events that were missed while the app was suspended. (FFM-8160)

  * It is no longer necessary to call registerEventsListener() to start listening to eventsâ€”calling initlialize() should be enough. (FFM-8106)

  * When a target group is created Harness sends an event to connected SDKs to refetch all flags. The IOS SDK previously didn't do this refetch, and now does. (FFM-8137)

  * Previously, when a target group event was received the SDK fetched all flags, but did not return an event so that apps could be updated accordingly. With this fix, in this case, the SDK returns the onPolling event after all flags are fetched. (FFM-8174)

  * Added `Harness-SDK-Info`, `Harness-EnvironmentID` and `Harness-AccountID` HTTP headers to outbound HTTP connections. (FFM-8048)

##### Early access

This release does not include early access features.

##### Fixed issues

###### Feature Flags SDKs

The **Erlang** server SDK has been updated to version **2.0.0** with the following updates.

:::caution
The following are breaking changes for Erlang applications only.  

* Due to a new dependency on a murmur3 hashing library implemented in Elixir, the following is now required to use the SDK in Erlang applications:

  * Elixir version 1.13.4 or above must be installed on your build system when compiling your application.

  * Rebar3 `rebar_mix` must be installed in your Rebar3 plugins.

  For full details, go to [Install the SDK for Erlang applications](/docs/feature-flags/ff-sdks/server-sdks/erlang-sdk-reference/#for-erlang-applications).

This update does not affect Elixir applications, and no further action is required for Elixir applications upon upgrading to this version of the SDK.
:::

These changes are part of issue FFM-8364:

* Enhancement: Implemented retry logic for authentication, polling, and metrics services for resilience and fault tolerance.
* Enhancement: Changed supervisor restart intensity from 1 restart in 5 seconds to 4 restarts in 5 seconds.
* The murmur3 nif library has been replaced by pure Elixir library.

#### June 28, 2023

##### What's new

###### Feature Flags UI

* On the **Feature Flags** page, when viewing the state of flags across all environments, the flag status column now scrolls all the rows as one. This makes it easier to view flag and environment states on one screen. (FFM-7643)

##### Early access

This release does not include early access features.

##### Fixed issues

###### Feature Flags SDKs

The **Python** server SDK has been updated to version **1.2.0** with the following updates. (FFM-8300)

  * To improve performance, the SDK now sends targets to the metrics service in batches of 1000. Up to 200 batches, or 200K unique targets, can be sent in the metrics window. This is not user-configurable, and is controlled through the SDK. For more information, go to [Feature Flag FAQs](/docs/frequently-asked-questions/harness-faqs/harness-feature-flag-faqs#how-does-the-metric-aggregatebatch-the-data-before-sending-it-to-harness).

  * The SDK no longer allows `events_sync_interval` to be set below 60 seconds. If it is, the value defaults to 60 seconds.

#### June 26, 2023

##### Early access

This release does not include early access features.

##### Fixed issues

###### Feature Flags SDKs

The **Node.js** server SDK has been updated to version **1.3.0** with the following updates.

* The following changes are included in issue number FFM-8289:

  * Added validation to the JWT token returned by the Feature Flags authentication service.
  * Previously, if the SDK failed to authenticate with the Feature Flags service, the SDK crashed. With this fix, the SDK now logs a warning and serves the default variations you provided in your evaluation calls.
  * Added a list of codes that are logged for each lifecycle event of the SDK, such as initialization, authentication, and so on. For a full list of codes, go to [Troubleshooting](/docs/feature-flags/ff-sdks/server-sdks/node-js-sdk-reference#troubleshooting).

##### Early access

This release does not include early access features.

##### Fixed issues

###### Feature Flags SDKs

The **JavaScript** client SDK has been updated to version **1.14.0** with the following update.

* Added a new function, `refreshEvaluations()`, which can be called to programmatically trigger a full refetch of evaluations from the server. (FFM-8141)

#### June 21, 2023

##### What's new

This release does not include new features.  

##### Early access

This release does not include early access features.

##### Fixed issues

###### Feature Flags server/UI

The **FF server** has been updated to version **1.1075.0** with the following updates.

* The Activity tab on the flag detail page was sometimes slow to load on flags with many (hundreds) of historical changes. This has been resolved, and this tab's loading times are improved. (FFM-8256)

* On the flag detail page, Flag Pipeline tab, the pipeline execution list was sorted with most recent executions last. This ordering has been reversed so that the most recent pipeline executions are shown first. This allows pending executions to be viewed at the top.

* Where users had multiple target rules, in certain circumstances users couldn't delete these rules when the wrong IDs were returned. This fix addresses the problem of the incorrect IDs being returned, and ensures the targets can be removed.

###### Feature Flags SDKs

The **Python** server SDK has been updated to version **1.1.16** with the following updates.

* Previously, if the SDK evaluated flags with a large amount of targets (tens of thousands), the SDK could encounter `read_timeout` errors. This fix increases the HTTP timeout of the SDK, and imposes a limit of 50,000 on the number of targets that can be sent to the UI. (FFM-8231)

  **Known issue** - We are working on resolving the following issue in a future version:

  * During a metrics interval, if you evaluate flags with more than 50,000 unique targets (based on identifier, name and attributes), then only the first 50,000 targets get sent in the request to the metrics API. This means that the targets that are not included in the request do not appear in the UI, but when they are included in evaluations during subsequent metrics intervals, they will be correctly registered in the UI.

#### June 19, 2023

##### What's new

###### Feature Flags UI

* In the onboarding flow, we added a new button and text box for a new project when there are no environments created. (FFM-7393)

##### Early access

This release does not include early access features.

##### Fixed issues

###### Feature Flags UI

* The view in the modal screen for setting up GitEx was not wide enough to show appropriate errors. This issue has been fixed. (FFM-7311)

* The Create a new flag button did not behave as expected on the onboarding screen if there were existing flags. This issue has been fixed. (FFM-8019)

###### Feature Flags SDKs

* The **Java** server SDK has been updated to version **1.2.3** with the following updates.

  * There were reports of customers having difficulty running the SDK because of a missing dependency, `oksse`. Unless users have the JitPack repo in their POM/Gradle file, they are likely to have this problem at compile time. With this fix, we've removed the `oksse` dependency and now use `okhttp-sse` instead. (FFM-5915)

  * Added `Harness-SDK-Info`, `Harness-EnvironmentID` and `Harness-AccountID` HTTP headers to outbound HTTP connections. (FFM-7037)

  * Updated the `maven-model` dependency to version 3.5.0 to remove the CVE-2022-4245 vulnerability. (FFM-8133)

  * Updated to the latest version of Guava, 32.0.1-jre, to remove security issues. (FFM-8233)

* The **Android** client SDK has been updated to version **1.1.0** with the following updates.

  * Added a new API to allow SDK users to provide a trusted TLS CA certificate for connecting to Feature Flag services with private root CAs. (FFM-7008)

  * Added `Harness-SDK-Info`, `Harness-EnvironmentID` and `Harness-AccountID` HTTP headers to outbound HTTP connections. (FFM-7037)

  * Fixed broken links in the first time setup documentation. (FFM-7867)

* The **.NET** server sdk has been updated to version **1.1.8** with the following updates.

  * Added additional headers to SDK HTTP requests for better analytics. (FFM-7477)

  * Reworked metrics caching to use a map instead of a queue. This improves memory usage and performance. (FFM-7475)

  * We now send the SDK version information with the metrics payload for better analytics and tracking. (FFM-6904)

  * Added logging when a default evaluation is served. (FFM-7473)

  * Standardized and improved Logging across the SDK. (FFM-7472)

  * Fixed error handling when a null target is passed in. (FFM-8128)

#### June 14, 2023

##### What's new

###### Feature Flags SDKs

Updated the ff-flutter-client-sdk version 2.0.0 to use null safety. (FFM-8222)

Flutter 2.0 and Dart 2.12 and later are required. For more information, go to [Sound null safety](https://dart.dev/null-safety) in the Dart documentation.

##### Early access

This release does not include early access features.

##### Fixed issues

#### Feature Flags SDKs

Updated the ff-erlang-server-sdk to version 1.1.0 to add an optional logging configuration option so that the logging level can be set for the SDK. (FFM-8217)

If this option is not set, the SDK uses the default log level of `warning`. To see an example logging configuration, go to [the SDK readme](https://github.com/harness/ff-erlang-server-sdk/blob/main/README.md#set-logging-level).

#### June 9, 2023

##### What's new

###### Feature Flags SDKs

* To aid in debugging, we added a list of codes logged for each lifecycle of the SDK. (FFM-7363)

  Some of the lifecycle events these codes cover are:

  * Initialization
  * Authentication
  * Polling
  * Streaming
  * Evaluation
  * Metrics
  * Close

For a full list of codes, go to [Troubleshooting](/docs/feature-flags/ff-sdks/server-sdks/python-sdk-reference/#troubleshooting).

##### Early access

This release does not include early access features.

##### Fixed issues

###### Feature Flags SDKs

The **Python** server SDK has been updated to version **1.1.15** with the following update.

* Previously, the SDK crashed if `client.close()` was called at any point before a stream event was sent to the SDK. With this fix, the SDK closes all threads correctly. (FFM-7363)

###### Feature Flags UI

* In the user onboarding flow, the Create a New Flag button did not behave as expected. This issue has been fixed. (FFM-8019)

* Previously, a user could select Feature Flags in Harness without having a license, and would then get a 404 error. Now, users only see the FF module if they have an active license (including a free license). (FFM-8002)

* Previously, there was an edge case where an extremely large number of pages in a UI listing could cause performance degradation. This issue has been fixed, and page numbering is now disabled if the page count exceeds 1000 pages. (FFM-7993)

* There was an issue where toggling between the Targets and Target Groups pages caused the new page to re-render. This issue has been fixed. (FFM-7965)

#### June 8, 2023

##### What's new

###### Feature Flags SDKs

The **React** client SDK has been updated to version **1.4.0** with the following enhancements. (FFM-6920)

* Added a new [useFeatureFlagsLoading](https://github.com/harness/ff-react-client-sdk#usefeatureflagsloading) hook to allow apps to react to changing of loading state.

* Added a new [TestWrapper](https://github.com/harness/ff-react-client-sdk#testing-with-jest) testing component to allow easy mocking of the network portion of the SDK for use in [Jest](https://github.com/harness/ff-react-client-sdk#testing-with-jest) unit tests.

##### Early access

This release does not include early access features.

##### Fixed issues

###### Feature Flags UI

* Previously, display of the FF module depended on an internal Harness feature flag. Now, display of the FF module is instead based on having an active license (including 'free'). (FFM-7866)

* Previously when a new user was onboarding in the Feature Flags page, when they selected **Get Started**, they saw a dropdown of flags, even though they hadn't created any flags yet. Now, when users do not have any existing flags, they see a text box that prompts them to create one.

###### Feature Flags SDKs

* The **iOS** client SDK has been updated to version **1.0.4** with the following updates.

  * Fixed the stream connection to have a read timeout of 60 seconds. This enables stale connections to be detected and closed, and retries to be started for polling/SSE connections. (FFM-8051)
  * Fixed a nil pointer dereference bug that caused the SDK to crash under certain conditions. (FFM-8034)

#### May 25, 2023

##### Early access

This release does not include early access features.

##### Fixed issues

###### Feature Flags server

The **FF server** has been updated to version **1.1071.0** with the following updates.

* For customers with a large volume of targets (in the millions), the Target page load time could be slow. Harness has introduced additional indexes to improve the response time of this page. (FFM-7988)

* There was an issue when Git Sync was first configured, a sync was not attempted until a flag was changed or a new one was created. With this fix, a sync is immediately attempted when you configure Git Sync, and the existing flags in your project are backed up to the remote file. (FFM-7681)

###### Feature Flags SDKs

The **Python** server SDK has been updated to version **1.1.12** with the following update.

*  There was an issue where if an error occurred when processing a new stream event, the SDK could potentially log a blank string. This issue has been fixed and the SDK now logs these errors correctly. (FFM-8015)

##### Early access

This release does not include early access features.

##### Fixed issues

###### Feature Flags SDKs

The **Ruby** server SDK has been updated to version **1.1.1** with the following updates.

* Fixed evaluator logic. Before, if a target group had multiple clauses, all clauses had to evaluate to true for the entire condition to be true. This logic has been changed to match that of other SDKs. Now only one condition clause needs to be true. (FFM-6503)

* Certain log messages will now be coded with a unique 4-digit number to help identify issues across SDKs. (FFM-7324)
  
  Response code patterns for each SDK stage are:
  * Initialization - 1xxx
  * Auth - 2xxx
  * Close - 3xxx
  * Polling - 4xxx
  * Streaming - 5xxx
  * Evaluation - 6xxx
  * Metrics - 7xxx

##### Early access

This release does not include early access features.

##### Fixed issues

###### Feature Flags server

The **FF server** has been updated to version **1.1054.2** with the following update.

* The Identifier search filter sometimes incorrectly used a wildcard match. This happened if two flags had overlapping names such as `flag_one` and `flag_one_b`. The detail view of `flag_one_b` sometimes returned `flag_one` details instead. Because flags order by creation, this only happened when flags were created in a certain order. This fix uses an exact match when searching for flag identifiers. (FFM-7928)

#### May 15, 2023

##### What's new

This release does not include new features.

##### Early access

This release does not include early access features.

##### Fixed issues

###### Feature Flags server

* Previously, re-enabling Git Experience did not trigger an immediate Git sync. With this change, flags are synchronized as soon as Git Experience is re-enabled. (FFM-7670)

* Some Git sync operations were failing if there was a large volume of flags and environments. This fix increased the transaction time-out for Git sync calls to allow processing of a large number of the flags. (FFM-7638)

* Policy checks weren't being carried out on flag rules added from the Target Group details page. This issue has been fixed. (FFM-7607)(FFM-7606)

* Previously, Feature Flag permissions and roles assigned to users or user groups in Access Control were applied at the account and project levels, but not at the organization level. With this change, roles and permissions assigned at the organization level are now honored. (FFM-7376)

* When you try to delete a flag that is a prerequisite to another flag, the UI now shows an improved message that explains why this cannot be done: *Cannot delete flag which is a prerequisite for other flags*. (FFM-5105)

##### Fixed issues

###### Feature Flags server

The **FF server** has been updated to version **1.1007.0** with the following updates.

* Previously, the number of flags returned in the **Target Management** page was capped at 100.  This change lets Harness show all flags even if the number is greater than 100. (FFM-7457)
* Feature Flag identifiers now follow the same guidelines as the Harness Platform entities. This means they can include a `$` in the name. (FFM-7436)
* Previously, FF was only checking permissions at the account and project level. With this update, permissions and roles assigned at the organization level will also be honored. (FFM-7376)

###### Feature Flags SDKs

* The **Python** server SDK has been updated to version **1.1.10** with the following update.
  * The SDK now logs an error if an evaluation fails and the default variation is returned. (FFM-7360)

* The **Ruby** server SDK has been updated to version **1.1.0** with the following updates.
  * Metrics counters are now stored in a map, instead of a queue, for more efficient memory usage. The metric payload size should now also be smaller, resulting in more efficient network bandwidth usage. (FFM-7285)
  * Improved the authentication retry logic to only retry on certain HTTP codes. Certain error codes will be treated as transient and others not. Ensured that while the SDK is authenticating, default values are served. (FFM-7325)
  * Added a Ruby on Rails example in the SDK [repository](https://github.com/harness/ff-ruby-server-sdk). (FFM-6926)
  * Disabling the metrics processor didn't disable entries being written to the queue, causing an eventual memory leak. This fix corrects this behavior. (FFM-6965)
  * Added TLS support to the SDK and updated the documentation in the SDK [repository](https://github.com/harness/ff-ruby-server-sdk).

* The **Apex** server SDK has been updated to version **beta 0.5.1** with the following update.
  * The JSON parsing code was unable to parse the fields `createdAt` and `modifiedAt` in the Target Segment response, because the values were too large for an Integer data type. This issue has been fixed. (FFM-7812)

  * Minor internal changes were made to make it easier for developers to use classes that were previously marked private.

* The **Go server SDK** has been updated to version **0.1.8** with the following update.

  * Previously, a few logs on startup would use fmt.Println() instead of using the custom logger passed in via harness.WithLogger(logger). This could cause these startup logs to be in a different format, and appear to be logged at an `error` level instead of logged correctly as `debug`. This has been resolved and all logs emitted by the SDK now go through the custom logger if it's passed in. (FFM-7347)

###### Feature Flags SDKs

The **Go server SDK** has been updated to version **0.1.7**, with the following updates.

* Previously if a custom logger was passed in to the SDK through the harness.WithLogger(logger) function, the custom logger was not used when logging HTTP requests. This could cause HTTP request logs to be in a different format, and appear to be logged at an `error` level instead of correctly logged `debug`. This has been resolved, and all logs emitted by the SDK now go through the custom logger if it's passed in. (FFM-7327)

* Added a flag code cleanup example and some information on how to run the example in the [Go SDK repository](https://github.com/harness/ff-golang-server-sdk). (FFM-6794)

* Added documentation in the [Harness flag_cleanup repository](https://github.com/harness/flag_cleanup) on how to clean up flags automatically using Harness pipelines. (FFM-6796)

###### Feature Flag SDKs

The **Node.js server SDK** has been updated to version **1.2.10** and includes the following updates:
- The Node.js SDK uses the eventsource library. **In rare cases**, an issue occurred when a 500 response was received from the remote system, the connection seemed to close and stop retrying. However, if it received an unspecified error, for example if the endpoint doesnâ€™t exist or goes down suddenly, or if the remote system closed the connection, then the SDK tried to connect to the /stream endpoint every second, forever. This issue was resolved with the following updates:

  - The SDK now falls back to polling if the stream disconnects. (FFM-4204)
  - The SDK attempts to reconnect on retryable errors using an exponential backoff and retry strategy provided by the Harness fork of eventsource. (FFM-4204)
  - A new retry event is emitted so the SDK can log the current retry attempt. (FFM-4204)

###### Feature Flag SDKs

The .NET SDK has been updated to version 1.1.3. Fixes in this update include:

- The package name for the SDK has changed from ff-netF48-server-sdk to ff-dotnet-server-sdk. To use this version, make sure you remove the old package name and use the new one.

- The sample app in the .NET SDK Git repository has been updated to the new version 1.1.3. (FFM-3651)

- The default configuration of the .NET SDK didn't have analytics enabled. (FFM-3520)

  This has been fixed and analytics is now set to true and enabled as default.

- When using the Relay Proxy with the .NET SDK, the URL for sending events was incorrect. (FFM-3652)

  The events URL has now been updated so it directs to the correct place.

- The .NET SDK README file has been updated to rename the Target data. (FFM-3759)

  The example Target data is now consistent across the sample code in the README and the SDK Reference Guide.

- The .NET SDK README file has updated to remove an extra period and a reference to debugging that was causing the example to fail. (FFM-4306)
  You can now run the example successfully.

- When evaluating Target Groups that used an IN operator, the SDK was only evaluating the first Target. (FFM-4358)
  The logic has now been fixed so that the SDK will check all values when an IN operator is used for a Target Group.

##### Fixed issues

**Feature Flags UI**

- When creating a stage on pipeline template, Name and Description fields were displayed . (FFM-4098)

  As these fields are not required for creating a stage using a template, they have been removed from the About your Stage screen. You will no longer be able to enter a name and description for stages on a Pipeline template, but note this applies to templates only.

- When using a Pipeline and configuring a Flag stage, only the first 15 Flags in your Project would appear as an option in the Select Flag menu. (FFM-3716)

  This has been fixed and you can now select any Flag in your Project.

**Feature Flag SDKs**

The Python SDK has been updated to Version 1.1.1. Fixes in this update include:

- Removing the type of Flag check on Prerequisite Flags. (FFM-3868)

  Previously, if you created a Multivariate Flag as a Prerequisite Flag, once you turned the Flag on you couldn't turn it off again. This bug has been fixed and you can now turn Flags with Multivariate Prerequisite Flags.

- The Node.js SDK has been updated to Version 1.2.7. Fixes in this update include:
  - When using conditions for Target Groups, and conditions were treated as or conditions, meaning some Targets were not selected. (FFM-4331)
    This has now been fixed and conditions are treated correctly.

**Feature Flags UI**

- On the Harness Platform, when no Environment had been added to a project, the tooltip for a Flag toggle was displaying HTML. (FFM-4094)

  This has been fixed to remove the raw HTML text.

- On the Harness Platform, when the value of a Variation was set as a long non-breaking string, the content on the left bar of the Flag detail page overflowed into the main content of the page. (FFM-4010)

  This has been fixed so that the value will now wrap correctly.

**Feature Flag SDKs**

The Go SDK has been updated to Version 0.1.2. Fixes in this update include:

- The polling interval is now measured in seconds instead of minutes. (FFM-3676)
  This means the interval is now 60 seconds, instead of 1 minute. If you are using the default configuration, there are no actions for you. If you configured the polling interval, you need to convert the configuration from minutes to seconds. For more information, see Configure the SDK in the Go SDK Reference Guide.
- A check has been added to ensure that when a Flag has nested Prerequisite Flags, the correct Variations are served. (FFM-4043)
  You can now turn off analytics using the Go SDK. For more information, see Configure the SDK in the Go SDK Reference Guide. (FFM-3677)
