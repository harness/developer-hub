#### Monitoring
##### Custom Metrics Event Grouping (OR)
With [Custom Metrics, Event Grouping (OR)](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/22005565241101), users have the flexibility to choose more than one base event and aggregate up to 5 different events together when creating metrics. This allows users to build more complex metrics that fit their needs and combine different inputs into one metric.
##### Event Type Management Enhancements
Users can now create metric definitions without needing to set [event types](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360020585772-Events#h_01HGZV3J56QGKEV39YJ6KHF36M) beforehand in the Admin UI, removing bottlenecks between admins and users.Â 
Event types will be automatically deleted after 150 days of no data being received, eliminating the manual process of cleaning up unused types.
