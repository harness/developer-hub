#### SDK Enhancements
##### Support for Languages with no Split SDK
For those languages where there is no native SDK support, Split now offers a small service, written in Node, capable of evaluating some or all available features for a given customer via a REST endpoint -- the [Split Evaluator](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360020037072-Split-evaluator). We offer the Evaluator to be cloned as is or it can be easily spun up in a provided Docker Container.  For customers developing native iOS and Android SDKs, this is also a great service to use to allow you to manage all your feature rollouts on the server side and make sure you're not tying your mobile app version to a third party SDK.
