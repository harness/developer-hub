#### Monitoring
##### Alerting UX Enhancement
Previously, monitoring alerts were only generated when the sample size in each treatment reached 355. Now, users can receive alerts when the [sample size](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360020640752#minimum-sample-size) reaches a minimum of 200. This will allow users to fire alerts earlier, even if they have configured a lower sample size in their experiment settings.
