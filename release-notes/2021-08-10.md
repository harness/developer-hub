##### Statuses and Rollout board
You can now assign a status to each feature flag upon creation or when updating targeting rules. [Statuses](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/4405023981197-Use-statuses-in-beta-) indicate a feature's stage in the release process. [Rollout board](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/4405016480269) visualizes all flags by their assigned status so you can track multiple releases and experiments in one place.
