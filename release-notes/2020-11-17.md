#### Management Console
##### Admin Audit Logs
Split now logs every time an admin creates, changes, or deletes objects such as users, settings, and integrations. Admins can access these logs to see every change that was made and who made them. Admin Audit Logs can be filtered by change type or object; each log also contains a summary of the edit and a diff view of what elements of the object were edited.
#### Integrations
##### Admin Audit Logs Webhook
Split will now publish all admin audit logs changes to any URL provided by an admin user. Customers will now be able to store all admin changes in an internal system for future auditing purposes.
