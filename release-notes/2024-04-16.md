##### Switch Updates 
Users can now use Switch, Split’s in-app AI assistant, to easily summarize their experimentation results. Simply click on any metric card and hit the summarize button for a full analysis of your data. Please note, that this is a Generative AI feature that leverages end-user/customer data and will only be available to users who have specifically requested it to be enabled via Split’s Support team.
