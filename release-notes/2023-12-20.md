#### SDK Enhancements
##### **RUM Agents iOS **
With [RUM Agent iOS](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/22545155055373-iOS-RUM-Agent), the iOS SDK will automatically capture event data and send it back to the Split Cloud. Event data will then populate in Split’s Data Hub, similar to impression data. This eliminates the manual process of sending events to Split and enables a quicker setup of metrics and alert policies.
