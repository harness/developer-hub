##### Metric Filtering Multiple Comparison Correction (MCC) Update
When filtering your organizational metrics on the Metrics impact page, [MCC will only be applied once for all organizational metrics](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360037852431#key-and-organizational-metrics). This will prevent users from seeing different p-values when metric results are filtered.
