##### **Sequential Testing**
- [Sequential Testing](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360020640752-Monitor-and-experiment-settings#using-sequential-testing) is a statistical testing method that allows users to obtain statistical results without the constraint of an experiment review period. This allows users to receive faster experimentation results, so that they make informed decisions about releases, quickly.
