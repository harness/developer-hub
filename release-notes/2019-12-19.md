##### Metric Card Enhancements
Split's new metric designs will help you interpret your experimentation results more easily. We now highlight what range the metric impact lies between via the confidence interval. Also, more clarity will be provided for when the impact between 2 treatments is statistically inconclusive or if your treatments have not met the minimum sample size required for statistical testing.
