##### Event Visualization
With [Event Visualization](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360020585772-Events#exploring-events), users will be able to easily view their event data in aggregate directly in Splitâ€™s Data Hub without needing an external tool. This enables users to quickly validate if their event data is properly flowing into Split, and see how that event is behaving over time.
