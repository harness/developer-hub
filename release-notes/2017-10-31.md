#### API Enhancements
##### Full management of feature flags via API
The Split API now spans the full surface area of Split product functionality, including full management of feature flags (i.e. "Splits"). Via the Split API, you can now write code to programmatically create, modify, kill, or delete a Split. Or, go even deeper, by automatically changing a roll-out plan, including feature variations (i.e. "Treatments") or traffic distribution.
