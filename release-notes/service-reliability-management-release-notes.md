## December 22, 2022, version 77908

This release does not include new features, early access features, enhancements, and fixed issues.


## December 13, 2022, version 77808

### What's New

This release does not include new features.

### Enhancements

This release does not include enhancements.

### Early Access Features

Continuous Verification (CV) fails if the data for configured deployment strategy is not available. (SRM-12731)

Harness was automatically applying an alternate deployment strategy even if the required data for the deployment configured in the Verify step was not available.

Now, Harness does not automatically apply an alternate deployment strategy if the required data is not available. Instead, Harness fails the CV. Harness automatically applies an alternate deployment strategy only if you choose the Auto option in the Continuous Verification Type dropdown list when configuring the Verify step.

This feature is behind the feature flag SRM_LOG_HOST_SAMPLING_ENABLE.

### Fixed Issues

This release does not include fixed issues.

## December 7, 2022, version 77716

### What's New

This release does not include new features.

### Enhancements

Increased limit for number of PagerDuty services (SRM-13102)

The PagerDuty Service dropdown list, which displayed up to 25 services, can now display up to 100 services.

### Early Access Features

This release does not include early access features.

### Fixed Issues

Pipeline deployment throws an exception with the message RuntimeException: name cannot be more than 64 characters long. if the name of the monitored service exceeds 64 characters. (SRM-12811)

This restriction is removed. Now, the name of the monitored service can contain up to 128 characters.

## November 29, 2022, version 77608

### What's New

N/A

### Enhancements

The user interface no longer allows you to configure invalid metric thresholds. (SRM-12386)

On the Customize Health Source tab, the following changes are made to the Advanced (Optional) configuration section:

Under the Ignore Thresholds settings, only the Less than option is available for the Percentage Deviation criteria. The Greater than option is removed.

Under the Fail-Fast Thresholds settings, only the Greater than option is available for the Percentage Deviation criteria. The Less than option is removed.

### Early Access Features

N/A

### Fixed Issues

- When the metrics feature was selected for the Splunk health source, the Continuous Verification and Service Health options were getting selected by default, even though those options are not supported for Splunk. This was causing continuous verification to fail. (SRM-12793)

  Now, if you select the metrics feature for the Splunk health service, the continuous verification and service health options are disabled. Only the SLI option is available.

- Custom metric configuration for the Splunk and New Relic health sources fails if the Metric Value JSON Path and Timestamp Field/Locator JSON Path queries contain a period (.). (SRM-12552)

  Now, the Metric Value JSON Path and Timestamp Field/Locator JSON Path queries are automatically wrapped with square brackets and single quotes. This prevents the custom metric configuration from failing even if your JSON path queries contain a period (.)

## September 7th, 2022, version 76619

### Fixed issues

- Metric Threshold configurations are not persisted if the criteria is percentage deviation and lesser than is selected in fast-fail thresholds (SRM-11696)

- Not able to update prometheus source (SRM-11578, ZD-33879)

## August 31st, 2022, version 76518

### Fixed issues

- Error while setting up CV step in NG pipeline (SRM-11553, ZD-33562)

- Updated ServiceMethodId when Dynatrace service is selected from dropdown.

## August 25th, 2022, version 76425

No changes in this release.

## August 18th, 2022, version 76321

### Fixed issues

- Request body place holders are not serialized properly unless surrounded by "" (SRM-11217)

  The request body for custom log source was not getting serialized properly due to the treatment of numbers in Gson library which we use. By upgrading the version of the library, we now have support to customize this behavior. Now we have defined how a number will be deserialized.

  This issue is now resolved.

- Fix the text wrapping in Health Sources table in Verify step (SRM-11185)

## August 8th, 2022, version 76128

### Fixed issues

- Fetching Audits and JSON DTO Issues in Audit List API (SRM-11140)

  Sequence in which services are deleted when project is deleted was incorrect. Now while deleting the project we can see both Monitored service and SLO audits.

- Monitored Service with New Relic health source displays error message “same identifier is used by multiple entities” even though there is no other health source with same Id (SRM-10999)

## August 1, 2022, version 76030

### Fixed issues

- Verification is not happening correctly when we configure Monitored Service using templates (SRM-11097)

  Verify step for Template type Monitored Service was not working due to a missing record in the database. For such use cases, we use a transient entity. Updated to code to support both transient and persisted entities.

## July 18th, 2022, version 75921

### Fixed issues

- Data Collection for CustomLogs is failing in Verification step (SRM-11003)

  The Custom Log Health Source feature was unable to collect and process the data in the Verify step. This feature uses different DSL scripts to collect log data and service instance (host) data. If the log data collection DSL can also provide the host data, we do not need the host data DSL explicitly. However, in this case, the log collection DSL was also being used to collect the host data, which led to a Type mismatch error during the data processing. By removing the use of log collection DSL as the host collection DSL, we are able to pull the host data from the log data itself and it also ceases the exception. This feature is now working correctly.

- Creation of Custom Health Source Metrics for Service based is failing (SRM-11002)

  The Custom Metric Source Health did not work if the data query type was of type Service. The issue was happening due to a validation on the field metricPath in the Json response mapping, which is not present for the given query type. The given field is now optional. This issue has been resolved.

- GCP Metric Verify Step: Seeing null pointer exception in execution logs for GCP metric Health Source (SRM-10674)

  Fixed a null pointer exception in data collection for verify step.

- SLO: Not able to create an SLO with GCP as metrics (SRM-10594)

  Adding better logging.

## July 11th, 2022, version 75829

### Fixed issues

- Continuous Verification not appearing in Deployment Stage template (SRM-10934)

  Continuous Verification step was not appearing. Continuous Verification step now appears.

- Email Notification failing with invalid template message (SRM-10923)

  Added the message body into a string and formatted with HTML.

- SLO says "recalculating" for over a day (SRM-10864)

- Continuous Verification filter taking default monitored service for configured and template use case (SRM-10839)

  Implemented Continuous Verification filter logic for configured and template use case.

- Custom Health Host Metric data collection not collecting data for all hosts (SRM-10831)

- Prometheus Continuous Verification perpetual task failing (SRM-10829)
  Caused by comparability issues in decrypting data. Handling it gracefully now.
  Fixed compatibility issues with perpetual task.
