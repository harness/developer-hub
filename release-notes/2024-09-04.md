##### Guardrail Metric Alerts
Flag owners will now automatically receive alerts on any guardrail metric without manual configuration.
Alerts are sent to flag owners whenever a guardrail metric moves significantly in the desired or undesired direction. This feature is designed to help you make safe and accurate release decisions in a timely manner.
As a reminder, Guardrail Metrics ([released 2024-06-14](https://www.split.io/releases/2024-06-14/)) ensure that an organization’s most crucial metrics are protected and monitored throughout every feature release and experiment by making their calculation automatic and mandatory for all flags that use the same traffic type as the metric.
Metrics are set as guardrail metrics for your workspace on the Metric definition page. View the docs [here](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/22005565241101-Metrics#:~:text=Guardrail%20metrics%3A,impact%20is%20detected.)
