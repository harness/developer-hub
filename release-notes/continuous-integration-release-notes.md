## December 13, 2022, version 77808

### What's new

No new features are available for this release.

### Early access features

No early access features are available for this release.

### Fixed issues

- Recently, Harness added a new background step to allow CI users to easily set service dependencies instead of using the stage setting for service dependencies. However, since the feature flag stage still relies on the stage service dependencies, this capability was added back to the UI with this fix. (CI-6308)
- An unnecessary view appeared momentarily in the new CI Get Started flow. This issue has been fixed. (CI-6103)
- Previously, users were unable to apply changes after updating the Language field in the Configure Run Tests Step because the Build Tool and Arguments fields were required. The Build Tool and Arguments can now be set dynamically using inputs, allowing users to add and edit the Configure Run Tests Step and save it as a template. (CI-4868)

### Deprecated features

- AWS Code Commit (CI-5665)
  The AWS Code Commit Git connector has been deprecated. Going forward, use the generic Git connector to integrate with AWS Code Commit.

- Unable to run the Google Cloud Function Drone plugin (CI-5869)
  The issue occurs because unexpected \_uuid elements were being added to the settings.
  To resolve this issue, the \_uuid attribute was removed from the nested setting attribute in the CI plugin step type.
