##### Enhancements to Split's experiment attribution & exclusion logic
Users are now allowed to move between targeting rules once and are allowed one unique rule and treatment change. Before this change, a change in treatments caused users to be removed from the sample. With this change, it is now possible to target customers using an attribute that when changed will result in a different treatment. Learn more in our [blog](https://www.split.io/blog/split-announces-enhancements-to-attribution-and-exclusion-logic/) or in our [documentation](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360018432532-Attribution-and-exclusion).
