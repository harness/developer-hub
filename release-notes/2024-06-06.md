##### Semantic Versioning Targeting
Using the latest Split SDKs, users can more easily define targeting rules for new features based on app, OS, and other versions using attribute-based targeting. The SDK then automatically serves the appropriate treatment to users without needing additional code configurations. Splitâ€™s native [Semantic Versioning Targeting](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360020793231-Target-with-custom-attributes#semver-attributes) removes the additional complexities and manual work that comes with targeting different application versions, allowing users to seamlessly deliver different experiences.
