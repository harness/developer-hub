#### SDK Enhancements
##### Support for listener in iOS and Android SDKs
Split SDKs send impression data back to Split servers periodically and as a result of evaluating splits. In order to additionally send this information to a location of your choice, define and attach an impression listener. Learn more in our [iOS](https://www.split.io/product/languages/ios-sdk/) and [Android](https://www.split.io/product/languages/android-sdk/) documentation.
##### Sentinel Redis support for Python & PHP SDKs
