#### SDK Enhancements
##### Evaluate Without Sending Impressions
Split as added a new impression mode, NONE. Which can now enable [all Split SDKS](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360033557092-SDK-overview#supported-sdks) to send only unique keys per Split rather than sending all impression data. This will help decrease network traffic from your system to Split, ultimately leading to lower resource consumption.
