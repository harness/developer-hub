#### Integration Enhancements
##### Support for integration with Segment as both a source and destination
Split can now be both a data destination and a source for Segment. As a destination, Split supports the *identify*, *group*, *track*, *page*, and *screen* specs from Segment. As a source, data will flow from Split into Segment as a track type with the event name get_treatment. Learn more in our [blog](https://www.split.io/blog/send-data-from-every-customer-touchpoint-to-split-with-our-new-segment-integration/) or in our [documentation](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360020742532-Segment).
