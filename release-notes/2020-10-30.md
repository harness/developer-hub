##### Multiple Comparison Correction
You can now apply a statistical correction to control the False Discovery Rate when making multiple comparisons in the same experiment. The significance threshold setting can be adjusted to higher or lower confidence. Using the default significance threshold of 5%, you can be confident that at least 95% of all the changes without meaningful impacts don't incorrectly show as statistically significant. This guarantee applies regardless of how many metrics you have.
