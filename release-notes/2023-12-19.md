##### React SDK Updates
Split’s [React SDK](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360038825091-React-SDK) hooks can now return the SDK’s readiness status and support update parameters to control when an application will render. These properties now allow users to easily refresh application components with just a few lines of code.
The useSplitTreatments hook has been optimized to detect duplicate getTreatment calls, improving the performance and UX of the application.
