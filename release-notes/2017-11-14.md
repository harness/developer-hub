#### Introducing the Split Intelligent Results Engine
The Split Intelligent Results Engine is a metrics-first statistical engine built for engineering teams that handles data ingestion from any source, calculates metrics based on that data and joins the data to features, automatically highlighting significant changes due to feature releases across the metrics that matter most. Available today in the initial release, is a new Results tab for a Split that graphically displays impression data (i.e. each time a visitor experienced a treatment, or variation of a feature), and provides statistics on that data. The new results engine also automatically resets metrics when a Split Definition is changed. The Results tab allows a user to select for what version of a Split they would like to view data.
