##### Alerting UX Enhancement
Users can now [manage their alert policy](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360020890491-Understanding-metric-impact#actions-you-can-perform) directly from their metric cards on the Metric Impacts tab. This change will make it simple to find where to manage alerts and/or know if alerts already exist for a metric.
