##### Guardrail and Key Metric Alerts Now Shown in the Alerts Table
Previously, the Alerts table on the Monitoring tab displayed Metric alerts only. Guardrail Metric alerts and Key Metric alerts generated email notifications to feature flag owners, but were not persisted in the UI.
Now all three types of alerts are shown on each flag's Monitoring tab for any team member to see.  The table has been simplified to display the most valuable fields at a glance, reducing cognitive load. Details less critical for quick triage remain available under an info icon.

As a refresher, here is quick summary of the three alert types:
- **Metric Alert**
- **Triggered**: when the relative or absolute impact threshold in an Alert policy is reached
- **Configured:** at the metric level, by [creating an Alert policy](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/19832312225293-Configuring-metric-alerting)
- **Monitors:** percentage rollouts for all flags which have the same traffic type as the metric
- **Guardrail Metric Alert**
- **Triggered:** when any statistically significant impact is detected, either desirable or undesirable
- **Configured:** at the metric level, by [marking a metric's category as "Guardrail"](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/22005565241101-Metrics#metric-categories)
- **Monitors:** percentage rollouts for all flags which have the same traffic type as the metric
- **Key Metric Alert**
- **Triggered:** when any statistically significant impact is detected, either desirable or undesirable
- **Configured:**at the feature flag level, by [marking a metric as a "Key metric" for that flag](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/19832711328397-Configuring-feature-flag-alerting)
- **Monitors:** percentage rollouts only for flags where the metric is a Key metric
