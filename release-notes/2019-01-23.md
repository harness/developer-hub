Split's new workspaces release makes it easier for product & engineering teams to manage the experiments and feature flags across different product lines and applications. Split Admins can create workspaces to have separate areas within Split for each product line or application. Each user can then navigate between workspaces to manage their splits, segments, and metrics separately in each workspace. This release also includes a new version (v2) of our [Admin API](https://docs.split.io/reference) for programmatically working with splits, segments, traffic types, environments, attributes, and customer identities as we have added in workspace context to the endpoints.
