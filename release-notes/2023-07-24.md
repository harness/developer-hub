##### **Viewer Role**
- Admins can now assign the role, Viewer, to users. With the [Viewer role,](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/16432983870605-Managing-user-permissions) users can now be assigned a role that allows them to view data and objects within the Split application without the ability to make modifications. This will give admins more flexibility and control when assigning roles.
