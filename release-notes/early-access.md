## Delegate early access features

The following early access (beta) features are available for the Harness Delegate.

### Delegate task capacity check

* **Release date:** July 2023
* **Release version:** 79904
* **Issue number:** PL-39351
* **Feature flag:** `DELEGATE_TASK_CAPACITY_CHECK`
* **How to enable:** Contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io)

Harness added the ability to acquire only the configured maximum number of tasks. This allows Harness Manager to use the task capacity to determine whether to assign a task to the delegate or queue it. You can configure the maximum number of tasks using the Env variable `DELEGATE_TASK_CAPACITY`. For example, if you set `DELEGATE_TASK_CAPACITY` to a value of 2 and execute 6 tasks in parallel, Harness Manager executes only 2 tasks at a time. If you don't configure `DELEGATE_TASK_CAPACITY`, Harness Manager executes all 6 tasks in parallel. When this feature flag is enabled, the task is broadcast every minute in Harness Manager until it expires.

### Capture delegate agent metrics for delegates shipped on immutable image types

* **Release date:** May 2023
* **Release version:** 79307
* **Issue number:** PL-37908, PL-38538
* **Feature flag:** `DELEGATE_ENABLE_DYNAMIC_HANDLING_OF_REQUEST`
* **How to enable:** Contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io)

Harness can capture delegate agent metrics for delegates shipped on immutable image types. The following delegate agent metrics are available with this feature flag enabled:

* `task_completed`: The number of tasks completed.
* `task_failed`: The number of failed tasks.
* `task_rejected`: The number of tasks rejected because of a high load on the delegate.
* `delegate_connected`: Indicates whether the delegate is connected. Values are 0 (disconnected) and 1 (connected).
* `resource_consumption_above_threshold`: Delegate cpu/memory is above a threshold (defaults to 80%). Provide `DELEGATE_RESOURCE_THRESHOLD` as the env variable in the delegate YAML to configure the threshold.

### Secure connect for Harness Cloud

* **Release date:** January 2024
* **Issue number:** CI-8922
* **Feature flag:** `CI_SECURE_TUNNEL`
* **How to enable:** Contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io)

[Secure connect for Harness Cloud](/docs/continuous-integration/secure-ci/secure-connect) facilitates private networking with Harness Cloud runners.

### Delegate selectors for codebase tasks

* **Release date:** November 2023
* **Release version:** 6501
* **Issue number:** CI-9980
* **Feature flag:** `CI_CODEBASE_SELECTOR`
* **How to enable:** Contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io)

Without this feature flag enabled, delegate selectors aren't applied to delegate-related CI codebase tasks.

With this feature flag enabled, Harness uses your [delegate selectors](/docs/platform/delegates/manage-delegates/select-delegates-with-selectors) for delegate-related codebase tasks. Delegate selection for these tasks takes precedence in order of [pipeline selectors](/docs/platform/delegates/manage-delegates/select-delegates-with-selectors/#pipeline-delegate-selector) over [connector selectors](/docs/platform/delegates/manage-delegates/select-delegates-with-selectors/#infrastructure-connector).

### Cache Intelligence in the Visual editor

* **Release date:** July 2023
* **Release version:** 5106
* **Issue number:** CI-8571, CI-8917
* **Feature flag:** `CI_CACHE_INTELLIGENCE`
* **How to enable:** Contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io)

You can enable [Cache Intelligence](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/caching-ci-data/cache-intelligence) in the Pipeline Studio's Visual editor. Previously, you could only enable Cache Intelligence through the YAML editor. For more information, go to the [Cache Intelligence](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/caching-ci-data/cache-intelligence) documentation. This enhancement only applies to Harness Cloud build infrastructure.

**Update (Version 5301, August 2023):** You can now also configure [Cache Intelligence](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/caching-ci-data/cache-intelligence) in the Pipeline Studio's Visual editor. Previously, you could enable Cache Intelligence through the Visual editor, but you had to configure it in the YAML editor. For more information, go to the [Cache Intelligence](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/caching-ci-data/cache-intelligence) documentation. This enhancement only applies to Harness Cloud build infrastructure.

### Send status updates to Harness Manager directly by HTTP (Rolled back)

* **Release date:** July 2023 (rollback from GA)
* **Release version:** 5003
* **Issue number:** CI-8338
* **Feature flag:** `CI_LE_STATUS_REST_ENABLED`
* **How to enable:** Contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io)

This feature causes CI steps to send status updates to the [Harness Manager](/docs/get-started/harness-platform-architecture#harness-platform-components) directly by HTTP, rather than through a delegate.

**Update (Version 5003, July 2023):** This feature was rolled back to early access and disabled by default due to a discovered instability that caused the [CD Container step](/docs/continuous-delivery/x-platform-cd-features/cd-steps/utilities/container-step) to fail. This feature flag is now disabled by default and must be re-enabled if your CI-to-Harness-Manager communications need to support client connections with additional certificates.

### Output variables automatically become environment variables

* **Release date:** June 2023
* **Release version:** 4204
* **Issue number:** CI-7817, ZD-39203
* **Feature flag:** `CI_OUTPUT_VARIABLES_AS_ENV`
* **How to enable:** Contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io)

With this feature flag enabled, output variables from steps are automatically available as environment variables for other steps in the same Build (`CI`) stage. This means that, if you have a Build stage with three steps, an output variable produced from step one is automatically available as an environment variable for steps two and three.

In other steps in the same stage, you can refer to the output variable by its key without additional identification. For example, an output variable called `MY_VAR` can be referenced later as simply `$MY_VAR`. Without this feature flag enabled, you must use an [expression](/docs/platform/variables-and-expressions/runtime-inputs/#expressions) to reference where the variable originated, such as `<+steps.stepID.output.outputVariables.MY_VAR>`.

For more information on this feature, go to the documentation on [Output variables](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/run-ci-scripts/run-step-settings#output-variables).

### Remote debugging

* **Release date:** May 2023
* **Release version:** 3805
* **Issue number:** CI-8135, CI-8048
* **Feature flag:** `CI_REMOTE_DEBUG`
* **How to enable:** Contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io)

Harness CI now supports remote debugging. This feature was initially released in January 2023 and subsequently reverted for further development.

Debug mode is available if all of the following conditions are met:

* You have the feature flag `CI_REMOTE_DEBUG` enabled.
* The build infrastructure uses a Linux-based OS.
* The build fails at a **Run** step with a Bash or Shell script in a **Build** (`CI`) stage.
* The build runs in Harness Cloud, on a virtual machine, or in Kubernetes.

You can re-run builds in debug mode through the **Builds**, **Execution**, and **Execution History** pages of the Harness UI. For more information, go to the [debug mode](/docs/continuous-integration/troubleshoot-ci/debug-mode) documentation.

**Update (version 4204, June 2023):** Debug mode now supports Python and PowerShell Core (`pwsh`). You can also now use debug mode for local runner build infrastructures. For more information, go to [Debug with SSH](/docs/continuous-integration/troubleshoot-ci/debug-mode)

## SRM early access features

The following early access (beta) features are available for the Harness Service Reliability Management module.

### Continuous Verification (CV) fails if the data for configured deployment strategy is not available (SRM-12731)

* **Release date:** December 13, 2022. This feature was released for early access in 2022. Early access features from past releases might have been promoted to GA since their original release.
* **Release version:** Delegate version 77808
* **Feature flag:** `SRM_LOG_HOST_SAMPLING_ENABLE`
* **How to enable:** Contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io)

Harness was automatically applying an alternate deployment strategy even if the required data for the deployment configured in the Verify step was not available. Now, Harness does not automatically apply an alternate deployment strategy if the required data is not available. Instead, Harness fails the CV. Harness automatically applies an alternate deployment strategy only if you choose the Auto option in the Continuous Verification Type dropdown list when configuring the Verify step.

**Update (Version 1.72.1):** You can now provide feedback about the AIDA-generated remediation step for a selected issue. (STO-6593)

<!-- EULA RQMT REMOVED -- You are now required to sign an end-user license agreement to access the Harness AI Development Assistant (AIDA) in the account and project scopes. You need to do this even if you could previously use AIDA without signing a EULA. This change was originally introduced in the 80505 platform release. The EULA is displayed when you enable AIDA at the account scope (**Account Settings** > **Account Resources** > **Default Settings** > **Harness AI Developer Assistant**). Each account user must sign the EULA only once, and the setting is inherited at the project scope. (PL-39723) -->

#### Improved UI for configuring scan steps

* **GA date:** November 2023
* **Early access release date:** March 2023
* **Early access Release version:** 1.38.3

This feature includes a set of Security steps with an improved UI for configuring scans. Each step shows only the settings that apply to the specific scan. Note the following:

- This release includes new steps for the following scanners: Aqua Trivy, Bandit, Black Duck, Checkmarx, Grype, Mend, Prisma Cloud, Snyk, SonarQube, and ZAP.
- Docker-in-Docker is no longer required for these steps *unless* you're scanning a container image. If you're scanning a repository or running instance, you don't need to set up a Background step running DinD.
- Support is currently limited to Kubernetes and Harness Cloud AMD64 build infrastructures only.
- For descriptions of all available UI settings, go to [Security step UI settings reference](/docs/security-testing-orchestration/sto-techref-category/security-step-ui-settings-reference).
