### Service Reliability Management

Continuous Verification (CV) fails if the data for configured deployment strategy is not available (SRM-12731)

Harness was automatically applying an alternate deployment strategy even if the required data for the deployment configured in the Verify step was not available.

Now, Harness does not automatically apply an alternate deployment strategy if the required data is not available. Instead, Harness fails the CV. Harness automatically applies an alternate deployment strategy only if you choose the Auto option in the Continuous Verification Type dropdown list when configuring the Verify step.

This feature is behind the feature flag SRM_LOG_HOST_SAMPLING_ENABLE.

### Feature Flags

We've released a beta version of an Apex SDK for Feature Flags.

### Continuous Delivery

ECS Run Task support

In addition to deploying tasks as part of your standard ECS deployment, you can use the ECS Run Task step to run individual tasks separately as a step in your ECS stage. The ECS Run Task step is available in all ECS strategy types. An example of when you run a task separately is a one-time or periodic batch job that does not need to keep running or restart when it finishes.

This functionality is behind feature flags: NG_SVC_ENV_REDESIGN and ECS_NG

For more information, go to the [ECS tutorial's run task step](https://developer.harness.io/docs/continuous-delivery/onboard-cd/cd-quickstarts/ecs-deployment-tutorial/).

## October 7, 2022

### Continuous Delivery

- ECS deployments: deploy artifacts to your Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) clusters using a Rolling, Canary, and Blue Green strategies.

Enable Feature Flags NG_SVC_ENV_REDESIGN and ECS_NG.

For more information, go to the [ECS deployment tutorial](https://developer.harness.io/docs/continuous-delivery/onboard-cd/cd-quickstarts/ecs-deployment-tutorial/).

- Traditional deployments using SSH or WinRM: deploy your artifacts to hosts located in Microsoft Azure, AWS, or any platform-agnostic Physical Data Center (PDC).

These deployments are called Traditional because they use Secure Shell and PowerShell scripts and a traditional runtime environment as opposed to containers and orchestration mechanisms, like Kubernetes.

Enable Feature Flags NG_SVC_ENV_REDESIGN, SSH_NG, and PIPELINE_MATRIX.

For more information, go to [Secure Shell (SSH) deployment tutorial](https://developer.harness.io/docs/continuous-delivery/onboard-cd/cd-quickstarts/ssh-ng/) and [WinRM deployment tutorial](https://developer.harness.io/docs/continuous-delivery/onboard-cd/cd-quickstarts/win-rm-tutorial).

- Custom deployments using Deployment templates: In some cases, you might be using a platform that does not have first class support in Harness, such as OpenStack, WebLogic, WebSphere, Google Cloud functions, etc. We call these non-native deployments. For non-native deployments, Harness provides a custom deployment option using Deployment Templates.

Enable Feature Flags NG_SVC_ENV_REDESIGN and NG_DEPLOYMENT_TEMPLATE.

For more information, go to the [Custom deployments using deployment templates tutorial](https://developer.harness.io/docs/continuous-delivery/onboard-cd/cd-quickstarts/custom-deployment-tutorial/).

### Harness Platform

- You can now create remote Templates in Harness and save it in your Git repo by enabling the feature flag NG_TEMPLATE_GITX. (PL-28573)

For more information, see [Create a remote step template](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/Templates/create-a-remote-step-template), [Create a remote stage template](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/Templates/create-a-remote-stage-template), and [Create a remote pipeline template](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/Templates/create-a-remote-pipeline-template).

- You can now use expressions to reference pre-existing secrets in Vault using a fully-qualified path. (PL-28352)

For more information, see [HashiCorp Vault Secrets](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/Security/reference-existing-secret-manager-secrets#option-hashicorp-vault-secrets).

- Harness will now send email notification for user invites when the feature flag AUTO_ACCEPT_SAML_ACCOUNT_INVITES is enabled. (PL-26218, ZD-32152,35287)

Harness will not send any emails for user invites when the feature flag PL_NO_EMAIL_FOR_SAML_ACCOUNT_INVITES is enabled.

### Continuous Integration

This release includes a new Docker delegate that you can install directly on a host. This feature is behind the Feature Flag CI_DOCKER_INFRASTRUCTURE. (CI-5680)

## September 7, 2022

### Harness Platform

You can now create a Harness Custom Secret Manager in Next Gen. (PL-25545)

You can onboard any secret manager with Harness and reference their secrets in Harness using a Shell Script.

This is behind the feature flag CUSTOM_SECRET_MANAGER_NG.

See [Add a custom secret manager](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/security/custom-secret-manager/).

### Harness Platform

Simplified Git Experience

Harness Git Experience lets you store configurations for your resources like Pipelines, Input Sets in Git. You can choose Git as the source of truth and use your Git credentials to access and modify your configurations.

With Harness Git Experience, you can select the repository and branch from where you want to execute your Pipelines, hence simplifying your Pipeline execution by seamless access to your Harness resources and their configurations stored in Git.

For more information, refer to [Harness Git Experience Overview](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/git-experience/git-experience-overview/).

This functionality is behind a feature flag: NG_GIT_EXPERIENCE
