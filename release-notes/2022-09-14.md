The[Ready to clean up](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/4405016480269-Use-the-rollout-board) view will filter the Rollout Board to show splits that have been in their status, 100% released, Removed from code, Ramping, or Killed, for at least 100 days. This will allow users to identify feature flags that can be retired which will help make the code more robust and readable.
