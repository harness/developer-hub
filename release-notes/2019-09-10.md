#### Feature Monitoring
##### Alert policies
With alert policies, you can respond quickly to performance degradations for each environment you operate in. You can configure a specific degradation threshold and customize who should be notified if your metric degrades. Split will detect a degradation in metrics in the first 30 minutes of a new version of a split.
##### Sentry integration
When configured, Split will ingest error and exception metrics from Sentry and ties these to the feature a user is exposed to. Split will display [Sentry exception data](https://docs.sentry.io/error-reporting/capturing/) in the Split platform for analysis. You can control what environments and traffic types you capture exceptions for in Split's dashboard without code.
##### Real User Monitoring (RUM) Agent
Track data such as Time to First Byte, Time to DOM Interactive, Page Load Time, Time to Interactive, Errors - key indicators of user experience. In addition, the agent collects key properties like connection type, url and userAgent to give you a full picture of the user using your feature.
