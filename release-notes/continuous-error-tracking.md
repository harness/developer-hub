- Unable to edit notifications created in the SRM module when using the CET module.(CET-1295)

  This issue has been resolved. Now, you can edit notifications within the CET module, even if they were originally created in the SRM module.

- The configured notification count on the Monitored Services listing page of the CET module displays notifications for all types of alerts related to a particular monitored service. (CET-1294)
  
  This issue has been resolved. Now, the notification list on the Monitored Services page of the CET module shows only the notifications for Code Errors.

- The events list disappears from the Events Summary page, despite having multiple agents running. (CET-1517)

  The issue was caused when the same event occurred across two deployments and environments. This issue has been resolved. The Events Summary page now accurately renders the events list, regardless of the occurrence of the same event across multiple deployments.

#### May 08, 2023, version 79111

Harness Continuous Error Tracking (CET) is now available for public preview to provide developer-first observability for modern applications. This is the first release of CET and the module is now available for Public Preview.
As the latest module in the Harness Platform, CET helps developers proactively identify and resolve errors across the entire software delivery lifecycle (SDLC).

Here are CET’s key features:

- Exception/error event summary: Provides a dashboard summary of all error events related to your monitored services.
- Event explorer: Provides a list of all error events for a specific monitored service and deployment version.
- Automated Root Cause Analysis (ARC) screen: Provides a powerful mechanism to view every exception’s source code, variables, and environment state.
- Hidden, resolved, and resurfaced events: Helps you manage and troubleshoot the events and exceptions by providing the ability to mark them as hidden, resolved, or resurfaced.
- Critical events: Enables you to add a condition that specifies when an event should be marked as critical.
- Source Attach: Connects your Git source repositories to Harness CET, allowing Harness CET to display the original source code in the ARC screen for an event.
- Shift Left with Harness CI integration: CET natively integrates into Harness Continuous Integration so that developers can run their unit tests and integration and detect errors early in the SDLC.
- JIRA integration: Allows you to create and view Jira tickets for a specific event.
