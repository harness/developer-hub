#### Web Console Enhancements
##### Tagging
Use tags to organize and manage splits and segments across the Split web console. You can use tags to isolate splits and segments for a particular team or feature release. Create tags like "reporting team", "front end", or "geo search release". Visit the [documentation](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360020839151-Tags) to learn more.
##### Groups
Split groups are a convenient way to manage a collection of users in your organization. You can use groups to grant administrative controls and grant environment, split or segment level controls. Visit the [documentation](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360020812952-Manage-user-groups) to learn more.
##### Permissioning
Building on groups, Split's permissioning can be enabled by environment, by split, or by segment, limiting the actions non-editors can take. Visit the [documentation](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360020579052-Permissions) to learn more.
##### Segment Includes
Target 100% of a segment with ease, making many clicks, just a few. Add a segment to the includes section of the editor to serve a particular treatment to all of the IDs in that segment.
#### SDK Enhancements
##### .NET Core Support
The .NET SDK is now compatible with .NET Core. Visit the [documentation](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360020240172--NET-SDK) to learn more.
##### TypeScript Support
The JavaScript SDK now supports TypeScript. Visit the [documentation](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360020448791-JavaScript-SDK) to learn more.
##### Node.JS & Redis
Node.JS now integrates with Redis and exposes the Manager API to inspect Splits and treatments. Visit the [documentation](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360020564931-Node-js-SDK) to learn more.
##### JavaScript SDK Local Storage
The JS SDK can now use localStorage as a cache, so subsequent page loads can benefit from faster SDK initialization time. Split will only request the difference from the server, further-reducing load time. Visit the [documentation](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360020448791-JavaScript-SDK#configuration) to learn more.
