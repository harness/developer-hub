##### Datadog Integration Update
Split has added functionality to the [Datadog integration](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/4822553169933-Datadog). With this update, account admins will be able to map the integration between a Split environment and a specific Datadog site. Split now supports the integration for any Datadog Site, including one for the EU.
