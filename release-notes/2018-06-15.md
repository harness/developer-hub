##### Owners
All splits, segments, and metrics now have an owner that can be an individual, a group or both. Use owners to isolate splits, segments, and metrics in the browse panes to those "owned by me" and simplify permissions by providing owners edit rights for a single split across all environments by toggling permissions 'on'. When toggled 'on', permissions will inherit owners as editors.
##### Simplified split editor
Simplified split rules editing and viewing for non-editors. Now you can edit your split rules with fewer clicks, view robust split definitions without having edit rights with new view only mode, and utilize longer treatment names with a higher 50 character limit. With this change we hope to reduce confusion by moving "default treatment" to the final field with clear explainer text that the default treatment will be used if traffic allocation is not 100% or the split is killed.
