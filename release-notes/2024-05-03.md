#### SDK Enhancements
##### Split Suite, iOS SDK
Users can automatically capture event data in Split using their [iOS SDK](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/26408115004429-iOS-Suite) without needing additional agents, integrations, or track calls. This eliminates the manual process of sending events to Split, allowing users to quickly set up metrics and alert policies.
#### Monitoring
##### Out-of-the-Box Metrics
Split automatically creates metrics for any events being auto-captured by the Split Suite and RUM Agents ([Web](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360030898431-Browser-RUM-Agent#automatic-metric-creation), [Android](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/18530305949837-Android-RUM-Agent#automatic-metric-creation), [iOS](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/22545155055373-iOS-RUM-Agent#automatic-metric-creation)). This reduces the manual effort of creating metrics and allows users to easily calculate their engineering and performance metrics.
