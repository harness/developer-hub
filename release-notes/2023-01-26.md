##### Alerting UX Enhancement
Users will now see a [bell icon](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360020586132-Creating-a-metric#viewing-metrics) within their metric list to easily identify whether or not an alert policy exists for a metric. If the icon is white, then no alert policy exists and if the icon is gray, then an alert policy exists for the metric. Clicking on the gray icon will take the user directly to the alert policy page for that metric.
