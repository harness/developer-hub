##### **PHP in-memory (PHP Thin Client SDK)**
- Split now supports running PHP [locally](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/18305128673933) using the [Split Daemon (splitd)](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/18305269686157) process to store and maintain feature flag data. This eliminates the need to use Redis & the Split Synchronizer while using our PHP SDK and provides a simpler set-up process.
