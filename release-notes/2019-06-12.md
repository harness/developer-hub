##### Event Property Capture
With this new release, you can now use event properties as filters to create more granular metrics and gain insights from a subset of users in your sample. Properties provide additional context around the events your customers generate. Event properties are attributes of a particular event and reflect the state and additional metadata at which the event was generated.
