##### React Native SDK
Our new [SDK for React Native](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/4406066357901-React-Native-SDK) is powered by Split's core TypeScript modules, and is optimized towards mobile lifecycle and use cases. It also uses a pluggable API to keep your bundle leaner by selecting only the features you need, with the ability to add more as we release them.
