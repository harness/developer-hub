##### Welch's T-Test
Statistical results in Split are now calculated using Welch's T-Test. Unlike the more commonly used Student's T-Test, Welch's T-Test does not assume that the samples have equal variances. This makes the Welch approach more accurate in cases where there is both a difference between the variances of the samples and an unequal rollout plan, e.g. 5% on, 95% off.
