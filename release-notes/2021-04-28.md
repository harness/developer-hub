##### Jira Software Integration Update
A new Jira integration is now available, with which you can connect and view issue and flag details in both Jira and Split. With this bidirectional connection, you can track rollouts for an associated issue in Jira and issues tied to a feature flag in Split.
#### REST API Enhancements
##### Approvals via the Admin API
Engineers can now use Admin API endpoints to approve and reject change requests. This will allow teams to externalize approval processes to 3rd party applications already being leveraged for change management.
