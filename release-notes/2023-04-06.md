##### SCIM Support
With [SCIM Support](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/sections/14249918421005-SCIM), IT Admins can now manage Split users and groups using their preferred Identity Provider (IdP) including [Azure Active Directory](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/12386431119245-SCIM-for-Azure-AD) and [Okta](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/10488076923021-SCIM-for-Okta).
