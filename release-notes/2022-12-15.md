##### Split-ServiceNow Integrations
The [Split-ServiceNow Integration Beta](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/5524203735181-ServiceNow) allows users to send change requests for feature flags and segments to ServiceNow DevOps and receive approvals back. This enables admins to leverage their customized change control process in ServiceNow without leaving the tool with which they're familiar.
