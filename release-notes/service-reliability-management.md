## March 31, 2023, version 78914

### What's new

This release does not include any new features.

### Early access

This release does not include any early access features.

### Fixed issues

- Monitored service creation fails when using a monitored service template that has Org or Account level service and environment. (SRM-14291)
  
  This restriction is removed. Now, you can create a monitored service using a monitored service template with Org or Account level service and environment.

- On the Monitored Services list page, a help panel appears for every monitored service listed. This is resulting in an overwhelming number of help panels that need to be closed individually. (SRM-14266)
  
  This issue has been resolved. Now, only one help panel appears for all monitored services listed on the page.

- SLO error budget notifications are being triggered even when the notification rule is disabled. (SRM-13997)
  
  This issue has been resolved. Now, SLO error budget notifications are not triggered if the notification rule is disabled.


## March 24, 2023, version 78817

### What's new

- When you try editing an existing SLO, you will see the **Tags (optional)** field autopopulated even if no value was entered while creating the SLO. Harness uses the selected SLI type as value to autopopulate the **Tags (optional)** field. (SRM-14121)
  
- There is a new user interface (UI) for Elasticsearch health source configuration. This update is designed to improve the overall user experience and make it easier to configure Elasticsearch health sources. (SRM-14180)


### Early access

This release does not include any early access features.

### Fixed issues

- The Time Window in the Service Health tab does not display the information for an event by default when accessed using the link in the event notification. Users had to manually search for the information by moving the Time Window to the event's date and time. (SRM-14071)  
   
  This issue has been resolved. The Time Window now displays the event information automatically when accessed using the link in the notification. Users no longer need to manually search for the information by moving the Time Window to the event's date and time.

- Error encountered when setting up monitored service in verify step with Org or Account level service and environment. (SRM-14191)  
  
  This restriction is removed. You can create a monitored service in the verify step even if the service and environments are at the Org or Account level.

- Unable to set the duration in the Verify step as an expression or use a value from other fields or variables. (SRM-13981)  
  
  This restriction has been removed. You can now set the Verify step duration using an expression or a value from other fields or variables.

- If a monitored service is updated in an SLO, the Monitored Service List page does not display the updated information in the SLO/ERROR BUDGET column. Instead, it shows that the SLO is still linked to the previous monitored service. (SRM-14078)  
  
  This issue has been resolved, and the SLO/ERROR BUDGET column will now display the updated information when a monitored service is updated in an SLO.
  
- The verify step fails when a monitored service is deleted and recreated within two hours with a different connector ID. (SRM-14021)  
  
  This issue has been resolved, and now the Verify step does not fail if the health source is deleted and recreated within 2 hours with a different connector ID.

- If there is no data received from one of the metric packs while configuring AppDynamics as a health source, the validation fails.(SRM-13597)  
  
  This issue has been resolved. Now, the validation passes if there is incoming data from any one of the metric packs.


## March 21, 2023

### Fixed issues

- The **Source Code** tab on the Automated Root Cause (ARC) screen shows blank during decompilation of source code instrumented with JaCoCo. This issue has been fixed. (CET-1175)
  
- The impacted services values were shown as "0 Service(s)" in the Event list. This issue has been fixed. (CET-1136)


## March 15, 2023, version 78712

### What's new

- Metrics graphs are now added to the **Create SLO** screen. (SRM-14025)  
    
  When configuring Service Level Indicators (SLIs) in the **Create SLO** screen, you will now see a metric graph based on the last 24 hours of data received from your health monitoring tool. Additionally, the recommended minimum, maximum, and average values specific to the SLI parameter that you are configuring will be displayed.  
  
  This feature eliminates the need for switching between the Harness **Create SLO** screen and your health monitoring tool dashboard to determine the most appropriate value for the SLI parameter you are configuring. For instance, if you opt for the ratio-based evaluation method while configuring your SLI, you can refer to the metric graphs and accompanying suggested values to determine the ideal percentage of valid requests to be considered for your SLI.

### Early access

This release does not include any early access features.

### Fixed issues

- Continuous Verification (CV) fails due to timestamp format difference. (SRM-14167)  
  
  This issue is fixed by updating the timestamp format in the API request.

- Long Prometheus metric links overflow outside the **METRIC NAME** column and obstruct adjacent column values in the console view during pipeline runs. (SRM-14107)  
  
  This issue is fixed and the long Prometheus metric links are now contained within the **METRIC NAME** column, preventing them from obstructing values in the adjacent column.

- After saving and reopening a monitored service template, the **Save** button remained enabled even if no changes are made. (SRM-14107)  
  
  This issue is fixed, and the **Save** button is now enabled only if changes are made to the monitored service template. Additionally, an unsaved changes alert now appears next to the **Save** button when changes are made to the template values.


## March 8, 2023, version 78619

### What's new

- Specify metric thresholds in the monitored service template. (SRM-13972)  

  Now, you can specify metric thresholds for the health source when creating a monitored service template. This helps you predefine the metric thresholds and removes the hassle of specifying them every time you create a new monitored service.

### Early access

This release does not include any early access features.

### Fixed issues

This release does not include any fixed issues.

## February 28, 2023

### Early access

- Standalone Error Tracking experience. (SRM-12696)  

  This release introduces the standalone Harness Error Tracking (ET) experience. With this, you can quickly start using ET by installing the ET Agent on your Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and configuring it with Harness SRM.  
This feature is behind the feature flag `SRM_ET_EXPERIMENTAL`.

### Early access

This release does not include early access features.

### Fixed issues

- Saving the verify step in a stage template throws the `Invalid YAML. Can't find pipeline` error if the pipeline key is missing in YAML. (SRM-13320)
      
    You can now save the verify step in a stage template even if the pipeline key is missing in YAML.

- Even though metric data is not available from the health source for a time period, the **Overall Health Score** timeline displays green bars and shows the service score as 100. (SRM-13336)
  
  Now, on the Service Health page, the **Overall Health Score** timeline displays grey bars if metric data is unavailable from the health source for a specific time period. It does not show the health score.


## December 22, 2022, version 77908

This release does not include new features, early access features, enhancements, and fixed issues.


## December 13, 2022, version 77808

### What's New

This release does not include new features.

### Enhancements

This release does not include enhancements.

### Early Access Features

Continuous Verification (CV) fails if the data for configured deployment strategy is not available. (SRM-12731)

Harness was automatically applying an alternate deployment strategy even if the required data for the deployment configured in the Verify step was not available.

Now, Harness does not automatically apply an alternate deployment strategy if the required data is not available. Instead, Harness fails the CV. Harness automatically applies an alternate deployment strategy only if you choose the Auto option in the Continuous Verification Type dropdown list when configuring the Verify step.

This feature is behind the feature flag SRM_LOG_HOST_SAMPLING_ENABLE.

### Fixed Issues

This release does not include fixed issues.

## December 7, 2022, version 77716

### What's New

This release does not include new features.

### Enhancements

Increased limit for number of PagerDuty services (SRM-13102)

The PagerDuty Service dropdown list, which displayed up to 25 services, can now display up to 100 services.

### Early Access Features

This release does not include early access features.

### Fixed Issues

Pipeline deployment throws an exception with the message RuntimeException: name cannot be more than 64 characters long. if the name of the monitored service exceeds 64 characters. (SRM-12811)

This restriction is removed. Now, the name of the monitored service can contain up to 128 characters.

## November 29, 2022, version 77608

### What's New

N/A

### Enhancements

The user interface no longer allows you to configure invalid metric thresholds. (SRM-12386)

On the Customize Health Source tab, the following changes are made to the Advanced (Optional) configuration section:

Under the Ignore Thresholds settings, only the Less than option is available for the Percentage Deviation criteria. The Greater than option is removed.

Under the Fail-Fast Thresholds settings, only the Greater than option is available for the Percentage Deviation criteria. The Less than option is removed.

### Early Access Features

N/A

### Fixed Issues

- When the metrics feature was selected for the Splunk health source, the Continuous Verification and Service Health options were getting selected by default, even though those options are not supported for Splunk. This was causing continuous verification to fail. (SRM-12793)

  Now, if you select the metrics feature for the Splunk health service, the continuous verification and service health options are disabled. Only the SLI option is available.

- Custom metric configuration for the Splunk and New Relic health sources fails if the Metric Value JSON Path and Timestamp Field/Locator JSON Path queries contain a period (.). (SRM-12552)

  Now, the Metric Value JSON Path and Timestamp Field/Locator JSON Path queries are automatically wrapped with square brackets and single quotes. This prevents the custom metric configuration from failing even if your JSON path queries contain a period (.)

## August 25th, 2022, version 76425

No changes in this release.

## August 18th, 2022, version 76321

### Fixed issues

- Request body place holders are not serialized properly unless surrounded by "" (SRM-11217)

  The request body for custom log source was not getting serialized properly due to the treatment of numbers in Gson library which we use. By upgrading the version of the library, we now have support to customize this behavior. Now we have defined how a number will be deserialized.

  This issue is now resolved.

- Fix the text wrapping in Health Sources table in Verify step (SRM-11185)

## August 8th, 2022, version 76128

### Fixed issues

- Fetching Audits and JSON DTO Issues in Audit List API (SRM-11140)

  Sequence in which services are deleted when project is deleted was incorrect. Now while deleting the project we can see both Monitored service and SLO audits.

- Monitored Service with New Relic health source displays error message “same identifier is used by multiple entities” even though there is no other health source with same Id (SRM-10999)

## August 1, 2022, version 76030

### Fixed issues

- Verification is not happening correctly when we configure Monitored Service using templates (SRM-11097)

  Verify step for Template type Monitored Service was not working due to a missing record in the database. For such use cases, we use a transient entity. Updated to code to support both transient and persisted entities.

## July 18th, 2022, version 75921

### Fixed issues

- Data Collection for CustomLogs is failing in Verification step (SRM-11003)

  The Custom Log Health Source feature was unable to collect and process the data in the Verify step. This feature uses different DSL scripts to collect log data and service instance (host) data. If the log data collection DSL can also provide the host data, we do not need the host data DSL explicitly. However, in this case, the log collection DSL was also being used to collect the host data, which led to a Type mismatch error during the data processing. By removing the use of log collection DSL as the host collection DSL, we are able to pull the host data from the log data itself and it also ceases the exception. This feature is now working correctly.

- Creation of Custom Health Source Metrics for Service based is failing (SRM-11002)

  The Custom Metric Source Health did not work if the data query type was of type Service. The issue was happening due to a validation on the field metricPath in the Json response mapping, which is not present for the given query type. The given field is now optional. This issue has been resolved.

- GCP Metric Verify Step: Seeing null pointer exception in execution logs for GCP metric Health Source (SRM-10674)

  Fixed a null pointer exception in data collection for verify step.

- SLO: Not able to create an SLO with GCP as metrics (SRM-10594)

  Adding better logging.

## July 11th, 2022, version 75829

### Fixed issues

- Continuous Verification not appearing in Deployment Stage template (SRM-10934)

  Continuous Verification step was not appearing. Continuous Verification step now appears.

- Email Notification failing with invalid template message (SRM-10923)

  Added the message body into a string and formatted with HTML.

- SLO says "recalculating" for over a day (SRM-10864)

- Continuous Verification filter taking default monitored service for configured and template use case (SRM-10839)

  Implemented Continuous Verification filter logic for configured and template use case.

- Custom Health Host Metric data collection not collecting data for all hosts (SRM-10831)

- Prometheus Continuous Verification perpetual task failing (SRM-10829)
  Caused by comparability issues in decrypting data. Handling it gracefully now.
  Fixed compatibility issues with perpetual task.
