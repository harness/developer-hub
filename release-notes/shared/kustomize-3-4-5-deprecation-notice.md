To safeguard your operations and protect against potential security vulnerabilities, Harness deprecated the Kustomize 3.4.5 binary from delegates with an immutable image type (image tag `yy.mm.verno`). For information on delegate types, go to [Delegate image types](/docs/platform/delegates/delegate-concepts/delegate-image-types).

In place of Kustomize, Harness now uses the `kubectl` binary to conduct Kustomize operations. Recent enhancements (versions 1.14 and higher) have made the `kubectl` binary fully capable of supporting Kustomize operations. For more information, go to [Kustomization](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/manage-kubernetes-objects/kustomization/) in the Kubernetes documentation.

If your delegate is set to auto-upgrade, Harness automatically removed the binary from your delegate. This will result in pipeline and workflow failures for services that use Kustomize 3.4.5. 

:::info note
If your development team still uses Kustomize 3.4.5, you can reintroduce the binary on the delegate. Harness is not responsible for any vulnerabilities or risks that might result from reintroducing the Kustomize 3.4.5 binary.
