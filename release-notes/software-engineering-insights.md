## January 2024

### Version 202401.1

#### New features and enhancements

(SEI-2848) (SEI-4623) (SEI-4624) (SEI-4625) (SEI-4626)
* Optimized the [Sprint Metrics Trend Report](../docs/software-engineering-insights/sei-metrics-and-reports/velocity-metrics-reports/planning-sprint-metrics.md) to update the extended view and display data only when a new filter is applied. (SEI-4739) (SEI-4702) (SEI-4876)
* Added the support for configuring stages and steps as a filter for Azure DevOps pipelines in the Deployment Frequency and Change Failure Rate report settings. (SEI-4814)
* Improved the ingestion logic for the [HarnessNG Integration](../docs/software-engineering-insights/sei-integrations/automated-integrations/sei-integration-harnessng.md) to support data retrieval for non-container type artifact deployments. (SEI-4912)
* Enhanced the Lead Time by Time Spent in Stages report to make `ISSUE RESOLVED IN` a mandatory filter when the associated profile in the report settings has a Jira Release stage configured. (SEI-4668)
