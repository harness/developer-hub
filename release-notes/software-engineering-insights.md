  * After logging in, users will be automatically directed to the **first Collection** and **Insight**. 
  * For existing logged-in users, the application will maintain their latest state and navigate them to the recently viewed Collection and Insight, ensuring a seamless continuation of their workflow. (SEI-5203) (SEI-5690)

* Added the ability to display the `Custom Field Key ID` from **Azure Boards** while configuring the **Filters** on the **Report**, **Collection** and **Profile** settings. Now, when configuring custom field Filters, the Custom Field Key ID associated with the field is displayed for clarity. (SEI-5799) (SEI-5800) (SEI-5801)
* Added performance enhancements for the SCM metrics and reports. The following reports do not have the support for this enhancement: SCM PR Activity report, SCM PR Lead Time by Stage report, SCM PR Lead Time Trend report, Issue Hotspots report.

#### Fixed issues

* There was an issue which was causing the ingestion to fail for the **Jira** integration. This issue has been resolved now. (SEI-5213)
* In the **Activity Logs**, the `Email` data field is now case-insensitive. This means that records will show up when searched, regardless of the case used. (SEI-5872)
* Copying the widget to another Insights was not functioning properly, causing the application to freeze. This issue has now been fixed. (SEI-5879) (SEI ON HARNESS)

* In the **Collection** definition, when applying **Filters**, the expectation was for the **Azure Repos** and **Bitbucket** repository name to start with an uppercase letter. This issue has been fixed to ensure that the repository list no longer requires the first letter to be capitalized. This resolves the case sensitivity filter problem. (SEI-6018)
* The bug in the **Collection** definition that was causing a limitation on filtering repositories beyond the first 1000 has been resolved. This fix enables users to search for and select repositories from all available options when filtering the results. (SEI-6046)

The new experience for the re-authentication flow for the Jira and GitHub integration is accessible behind the Feature Flag `<SHOULD_ENABLE_REAUTH>`. Please contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io) to enable this feature. (SEI-5188)

* There was some inconsistency in the data displayed on the **Sprint Metrics Trend Report** when using [Azure DevOps](/docs/software-engineering-insights/sei-integrations/automated-integrations/sei-integration-azure-devops) as the integration for the **Issue Management Tool**. This has been fixed now. (SEI-4690)
* In the **Lead time by Time Spent in Stages report** there was an issue where in the extended drill-down view the data was displayed incorrectly. This has been resolved now. (SEI-4753)
* In the [Jira](/docs/software-engineering-insights/sei-integrations/automated-integrations/sei-integration-jira) integration, there was a bug where the **Custom Hygienes** were displayed as blank and were only showing story points as the criteria to define the hygiene misses. This has been fixed now. (SEI-5076)
* There was a bug where integrations created using the [GitHub App](/docs/software-engineering-insights/early-access/integrations/sei-integration-github-easyonboarding#configure-the-integration-using-the-github-app) were not ingesting data due to repositories not being selected during the integration creation. This has been fixed and now the ingestion should start automatically as the integration is created. (SEI-5223)
* In the **Issue Backlog Trend report** and the **SCM Issues Resolution Time Report** drill-down, there was an issue where the `Ticket Lifetime (Resolution Time)` column data was not visible in the downloaded CSV file. This issue has been resolved now. (SEI-5237) (SEI-5269)
* There were two known issues in the **Sprint Metrics Report** related to how certain Jira tasks/items were being counted.
  * Some Jira tasks were still appearing in the report even after they had been removed during the middle of the sprint. This happened because these tasks were included when generating metrics for the report. This has been fixed and now any tasks which are deleted mid-sprint will not appear in the Report. (SEI-5259)
  * The report incorrectly identified some tasks as falling outside of their designated sprint period. This has been resolved to identify issues added in the sprint based on the `Start Date` and `End Date` of the sprint. (SEI-5406)

### Version 202401.2.1
