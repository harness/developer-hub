* There was a bug where integrations created using the [GitHub App](/docs/software-engineering-insights/sei-integrations/automated-integrations/sei-github-integration#configure-the-integration-using-the-github-app) were not ingesting data due to repositories not being selected during the integration creation. This has been fixed and now the ingestion should start automatically as the integration is created. (SEI-5223)
* In the **Issue Backlog Trend report** and the **SCM Issues Resolution Time Report** drill-down, there was an issue where the `Ticket Lifetime (Resolution Time)` column data was not visible in the downloaded CSV file. This issue has been resolved now. (SEI-5237) (SEI-5269)
* There were two known issues in the **Sprint Metrics Report** related to how certain Jira tasks/items were being counted.
  * Some Jira tasks were still appearing in the report even after they had been removed during the middle of the sprint. This happened because these tasks were included when generating metrics for the report. This has been fixed and now any tasks which are deleted mid-sprint will not appear in the Report. (SEI-5259)
  * The report incorrectly identified some tasks as falling outside of their designated sprint period. This has been resolved to identify issues added in the sprint based on the `Start Date` and `End Date` of the sprint. (SEI-5406)
