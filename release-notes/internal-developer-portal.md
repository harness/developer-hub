Review the notes below for details about recent changes to Harness Internal Developer Portal.

## Latest - July 12, 2023, version 0.6.0

```mdx-code-block

```

- You can now access IDP catalog APIs by using the Harness X-API-Key. For more information, go to [API access](/docs/internal-developer-portal/features/software-catalog#api-access). (IDP-768)
- A newer version of the Harness CI/CD plugin has been added with new annotations support. It's now possible to filter pipelines across projects and orgs. For more information, go to the [plugin's readme](https://github.com/harness/backstage-plugins/tree/main/plugins/harness-ci-cd). (IDP-758)
- The Harness Feature Flags [plugin](https://github.com/harness/backstage-plugins/tree/main/plugins/harness-feature-flags) is now available in IDP. (IDP-778)
- The `trigger:harness-custom-pipeline` action on the software template `template.yaml` is now synchronous with pipeline execution. The action keeps running during pipeline execution, and it shows the current status of the pipeline.
- Since the `trigger:harness-custom-pipeline` is now synchronous, you can use the `catalog:register` action in a template and register the newly generated software component's `catalog-info.yaml`.
