<!-- Sept 25, 2023 -->

#### New features and enhancements

- IDP now includes the [GitHub Catalog Discovery](/docs/internal-developer-portal/plugins/available-plugins/github-catalog-discovery) plugin. You can use this to automatically discover `catalog-info.yaml` files from your GitHub organizations and repositories. [IDP-887]

## July 2023

### Version 0.7.0

<!-- July 27, 2023 -->

#### What's new

- IDP now includes the Confluence search plugin to include results from Confluence spaces. To learn more, go to the [plugin documentation](/docs/internal-developer-portal/plugins/available-plugins/confluence). (IDP-845)
- The `harness:create-secret` and `harness:delete-secret` template actions are now available for use in IDP software templates. You can use these actions to receive a secret from a developer, create a Harness secret, and then use it as a pipeline variable to provide runtime input. For more information, go to the [tutorial](/tutorials/internal-developer-portal/using-secret-as-an-input) (IDP-780)
- The interval at which IDP polls Git repositories associated with the software catalog has increased from 5 minutes to 15 minutes. (IDP-749)

#### Fixed issues

- When you used a delegate to connect to a Git provider, the Docs tab failed to load, and the following message was displayed: `Failed to build the docs page: TAR_BAD_ARCHIVE: Unrecognized archive format`. (IDP-687)

  This issue is now fixed.

- If you used a GitHub connector that used a Github App for API authentication and if the private key was a text secret, the catalog import in IDP failed. The failure was caused by Harness Secrets Manager not storing the specified private key with line breaks, which IDP expects along with proper indentation. (IDP-850, ZD-47845)

  Harness Secrets Manager now formats text secrets properly for text secrets used with IDP.

### Version 0.6.0

<!-- July 12, 2023 -->

#### What's new

- You can now access IDP catalog APIs by using the Harness X-API-Key. For more information, go to [API access](/docs/internal-developer-portal/catalog/software-catalog#api-access). (IDP-768)
- A newer version of the Harness CI/CD plugin has been added with new annotations support. It's now possible to filter pipelines across projects and orgs. For more information, go to the [plugin's readme](https://github.com/harness/backstage-plugins/tree/main/plugins/harness-ci-cd). (IDP-758)
- The Harness Feature Flags [plugin](https://github.com/harness/backstage-plugins/tree/main/plugins/harness-feature-flags) is now available in IDP. (IDP-778)
- The `trigger:harness-custom-pipeline` action on the software template `template.yaml` is now synchronous with pipeline execution. The action keeps running during pipeline execution, and it shows the current status of the pipeline.
- Since the `trigger:harness-custom-pipeline` is now synchronous, you can use the `catalog:register` action in a template and register the newly generated software component's `catalog-info.yaml`.

#### Fixed issues

- Fixed a bug with access control around de-registering a software component. (IDP-757)

## June 2023

- IDP now includes support for GitHub and Google OAuth applications. You can configure a GitHub or Google OAuth application in the IDP Admin view. These applications are used by the GitHub-based plugins to use the logged-in user's credentials when making API requests. (IDP-676, IDP-661, IDP-647)
- IDP now supports a URL allowlist. If the `catalog-info.yaml` references API definitions that are hosted on a provider other than your Git provider, add the URL to the allowlist. (IDP-648)
