### Version 0.23.0

<!-- Mar 11, 2024 -->

Continuing with the increased adoption of self-service flows, this release we're happy to introduce an intuitive minimalistic UI for the workflows page along with support for output variables on workflows page, to streamline user experiences seamlessly.

- **Blogs:** [Why Harness IDP, powered by Backstage, is Your Gateway to Effortless Developer Portal Excellence](https://www.harness.io/blog/why-harness-idp-powered-by-backstage-is-your-gateway-to-effortless-developer-portal-excellence)

- **New Docs:** [Custom Card Plugin](https://developer.harness.io/docs/internal-developer-portal/catalog/custom-card), [Catalog Entity YAML Examples](https://developer.harness.io/docs/internal-developer-portal/catalog/yaml-file)

- **New Videos:** [Custom Card Plugin](https://youtu.be/Qi1PIWSPves), [Workflow Upgrades](https://youtu.be/aethqdKmZOo)

#### New features and enhancements

- Now we have a [new UI](https://youtu.be/aethqdKmZOo) for the Workflows page, as part of the Backstage Upgrades. [IDP-2355]

![](./static/new-template.png)

- We have added a new custom processor to convert the email-id used under `owner` field in `catalog-info.yaml` to an `user` incase the username is part of the email-id. [IDP-2369]

- We have added a new [Custom Card Plugin](https://developer.harness.io/docs/internal-developer-portal/catalog/custom-card) to help users display the information, stored under the root fields of `catalog-info.yaml`, on a card in the overview tab. [IDP-2352]

- We have added a new [Evaluate expression](https://developer.harness.io/docs/internal-developer-portal/scorecards/checks-datasources#catalog) datapoint under the Catalog datasource to match input values for all the root fields `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata`, and `spec` only and the supported values under the root field. [IDP-2111]

- Now you can configure the output of `trigger:harness-custom-pipeline` to display the pipeline [output variables](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/variables-and-expressions/harness-variables/#input-and-output-variables), by setting the `showOutputVariables: true` under `inputs`and adding `output` as shown in the example below: [IDP-2328]

```YAML
...
output:
  text:
    - title: Output Variable
      content: |
        Output Variable **test2** is `${{ steps.trigger.output.test2 }}` 
    - title: Another Output Variable
      content: |
        Output Variable **test1** with fqnPath is `${{ steps.trigger.output['pipeline.stages.testci.spec.execution.steps.Run_1.output.outputVariables.test1'] }}` 
...
```
There are two ways in which you can add the output variable to the template syntax. 

1. You can directly mention the output variable name `${{ steps.trigger.output.test2 }}`, here `test2` is the output variable name we created in the pipeline. 

2. You can copy the JEXL expression of the output variable and remove the JEXL constructs, `${{ steps.trigger.output['pipeline.stages.testci.spec.execution.steps.Run_1.output.outputVariables.test1'] }}`, here the part `pipeline.stages.testci.spec.execution.steps.Run_1.output.outputVariables.test1` comes from `<+pipeline.stages.testci.spec.execution.steps.Run_1.output.outputVariables.test2>` copied from execution logs. 

![](./static/output-variables.png)

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the issue with missing labelSelector annotation resulting in scorecards checks failure message not getting displayed for some k8s related checks. [IDP-2270] 

## February 2024

### Version 0.22.0

<!-- Feb 22, 2024 -->

Given the interest of our users to know more about our IDP and what's coming up next, we have released a detailed [roadmap](https://developer.harness.io/roadmap/#idp) for IDP. Also we would further like to hear the feedback of users on our [ideas platform](https://ideas.harness.io/) regarding how they envision their developer portal to be and what improvements they would like to see in our IDP especially the suggestions for Plugins and support for new integrations.  

- **New Docs:** [Use Harness IDP for self serviced Harness CI/CD onboarding](https://developer.harness.io/docs/internal-developer-portal/flows/self-service-onboarding-pipeline-tutorial), [How to build Frontend Backstage Plugins](https://developer.harness.io/docs/internal-developer-portal/plugins/build-a-frontend-plugin), [Custom Dashboards](https://developer.harness.io/docs/internal-developer-portal/get-started/custom-dashboards)

- **New Videos:** [Create a New Python Lambda app using Harness IDP in 5 minutes](https://youtu.be/JMjbqAilJHU) 

#### New features and enhancements

- We have added support for displaying warning message on connector page, when a connector or secret is deleted. [IDP-2018]
- You can now optionally remove the pipeline url used to orchestrate the workflow, from the workflow execution logs displayed as output while using the custom action [trigger:harness-custom-pipeline](https://developer.harness.io/docs/internal-developer-portal/flows/custom-actions#1-triggerharness-custom-pipeline). For this you need to use the boolean property `hidePipelineURLLog` and set the value as `true`. [IDP-2183]

```YAML
## Example
steps:
- id: trigger
    name: Creating your react app
    action: trigger:harness-custom-pipeline
    input:
    url: "Pipeline URL"
    hidePipelineURLLog: true
    inputset:
        project_name: ${{ parameters.project_name }}
    apikey: ${{ parameters.token }}
```

- The Custom field extension **`HarnessAutoOrgPicker`**, which auto populates org id on project selection, would now pick project field value from the key that is mentioned under `projectPickerRef` as dependencies, if it's name is other than `projectId`. When properties have the project key and are named as `projectId` in that case you don't need to add the dependencies. [IDP-2243]

```YAML
## Example where projectId is mentioned under project_name
apiVersion: scaffolder.backstage.io/v1beta3
kind: Template
metadata:
  name: your-workflow
  ...
spec:
  ...
  parameters:
    - title: Details
       properties:
         project_name:
           title: Project Identifier
           description: Harness Project Identifier
           type: string
           ui:field: HarnessProjectPicker
         orgId:
           title: Org Identifier
           description: Harness org Identifier
           type: string
           ui:field: HarnessAutoOrgPicker 
           dependencies:
            projectPickerRef:
              - 'project_name'
```

### Version 0.21.0

<!-- Feb 8, 2024 -->

We are seeing a lot of excitement among our customers around Self Service Workflows to derive value for their developers. This release is especially for you if you are using IDP workflows for user/service onboarding.

- **New Docs:** [API Docs](https://apidocs.harness.io/tag/IP-Allowlist), [How to write IDP templates](https://developer.harness.io/docs/internal-developer-portal/flows/service-onboarding-pipelines#how-to-write-idp-templates), [List of on-hold Plugins](https://developer.harness.io/docs/internal-developer-portal/plugins/on-hold-plugins)
- **New Videos:** [Ignoring Developer Experience is Hurting Your Organization: DX is Critical](https://youtu.be/ka6kHPMGGpc?si=MCcVZdvP2bGCCI3h)


#### New features and enhancements

- The project picker in IDP workflows [`HarnessProjectPicker`](https://developer.harness.io/docs/internal-developer-portal/flows/custom-actions#harness-specific-custom-extensions) now shows the org as well. There is no change in the input/output values. [IDP-2048]

![](./static/idp-projpicker-newview.png)

- Added support for a new Custom field extension **`HarnessAutoOrgPicker`**, which auto populates on project selection. So now when you select an project id as an input the org id gets selected automatically if required as an input. [IDP-2099]

```YAML
# Example template.yaml file
apiVersion: scaffolder.backstage.io/v1beta3
kind: Template
metadata:
  name: your-workflow
  ...
spec:
  ...
  parameters:
    - title: Details
       properties:
         projectId:
           title: Project Identifier
           description: Harness Project Identifier
           type: string
           ui:field: HarnessProjectPicker
         orgId:
           title: Org Identifier
           description: Harness org Identifier
           type: string
           ui:field: HarnessAutoOrgPicker          
```
In the above example the the `Project Identifier` field once selected auto populates the `Org Identifier` field as shown below. 

![](./static/idp-proj-picker.png)

- Two new plugins [Azure Devops](https://developer.harness.io/docs/internal-developer-portal/plugins/available-plugins/azure-devops) [IDP-2078] and [Rootly](https://developer.harness.io/docs/internal-developer-portal/plugins/available-plugins/rootly) [IDP-1693] are available to use now!

- All IDP APIs are now available on our public API docs.[IDP-2113]


#### Bug Fixes

- Added support for word-wrap to ensure words are not broken on screen. [IDP-1972]
- Fixed the string input value to ignore leading slash for file path input value in scorecard checks[IDP-2084]. 
- Enhanced error handling for steps under developer portal stage. You should now see more meaningful errors [IDP-2105, IDP-2098, IDP-2087, IDP-2086, IDP-1943].

<!-- Sept 25, 2023 -->

#### New features and enhancements

- IDP now includes the [GitHub Catalog Discovery](/docs/internal-developer-portal/plugins/available-plugins/github-catalog-discovery) plugin. You can use this to automatically discover `catalog-info.yaml` files from your GitHub organizations and repositories. [IDP-887]

## July 2023

### Version 0.7.0

<!-- July 27, 2023 -->

#### What's new

- IDP now includes the Confluence search plugin to include results from Confluence spaces. To learn more, go to the [plugin documentation](/docs/internal-developer-portal/plugins/available-plugins/confluence). (IDP-845)
- The `harness:create-secret` and `harness:delete-secret` template actions are now available for use in IDP software templates. You can use these actions to receive a secret from a developer, create a Harness secret, and then use it as a pipeline variable to provide runtime input. For more information, go to the [tutorial](/docs/internal-developer-portal/tutorials/using-secret-as-an-input) (IDP-780)
- The interval at which IDP polls Git repositories associated with the software catalog has increased from 5 minutes to 15 minutes. (IDP-749)

#### Fixed issues

- When you used a delegate to connect to a Git provider, the Docs tab failed to load, and the following message was displayed: `Failed to build the docs page: TAR_BAD_ARCHIVE: Unrecognized archive format`. (IDP-687)

  This issue is now fixed.

- If you used a GitHub connector that used a Github App for API authentication and if the private key was a text secret, the catalog import in IDP failed. The failure was caused by Harness Secrets Manager not storing the specified private key with line breaks, which IDP expects along with proper indentation. (IDP-850, ZD-47845)

  Harness Secrets Manager now formats text secrets properly for text secrets used with IDP.

### Version 0.6.0

<!-- July 12, 2023 -->

#### What's new

- You can now access IDP catalog APIs by using the Harness X-API-Key. For more information, go to [API access](/docs/internal-developer-portal/catalog/software-catalog#api-access). (IDP-768)
- A newer version of the Harness CI/CD plugin has been added with new annotations support. It's now possible to filter pipelines across projects and orgs. For more information, go to the [plugin's readme](https://github.com/harness/backstage-plugins/tree/main/plugins/harness-ci-cd). (IDP-758)
- The Harness Feature Flags [plugin](https://github.com/harness/backstage-plugins/tree/main/plugins/harness-feature-flags) is now available in IDP. (IDP-778)
- The `trigger:harness-custom-pipeline` action on the software template `template.yaml` is now synchronous with pipeline execution. The action keeps running during pipeline execution, and it shows the current status of the pipeline.
- Since the `trigger:harness-custom-pipeline` is now synchronous, you can use the `catalog:register` action in a template and register the newly generated software component's `catalog-info.yaml`.

#### Fixed issues

- Fixed a bug with access control around de-registering a software component. (IDP-757)

## June 2023
