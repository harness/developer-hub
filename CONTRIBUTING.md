Thanks for considering to contribute to the Harness Developer Hub! Contributions come in all shapes and sizes and we appreciate them all. Contributions to the Harness Developer Hub comes in the form of Pull Requests or submitting Issues. 

## Change Process
GitHub will be the primary mechanism for changes. Pull Requests are the mechanism to submitting and approving changes. For smaller changes, this can be done in-line on GitHub. For larger changes, a Fork is a better route. 

### Small Changes
Small changes are items such as singular typo in an MD file does not require you to Fork. Create a new branch based on your change.

### Large Changes
Large changes are considered to be an entire document/tutorial or making UI/UX changes such as to the site structure, organization, or branding. These will require a Fork and local development/testing.  

## Local Development Guide
The Harness Developer Hub is powered by [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). Larger changes should be vetted locally before submitted a PR.  

* NPM
* Yarn

Will need to Fork this repository and create a Branch to commit which will be basis for the eventual PR . On your local machine, can run the following assuming you are running a Mac and have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/): 

```
#Install Node
brew install node

#Run 
cd developer-hub

#Install Yarn
npm install --global yarn

#Validate Install
yarn --version

#Launch Site
yarn
yarn start

#Access
http://localhost:3000

```

## Stylistic Guide
A great stylistic guide to follow is the Microsoft Documentation Stylistic Guide:

Since the final document is in Markdown, feel free to author in a tool of your choice and port to Markdown. 

Vale is an excellent tool for validating spelling and style in Markdown. You can run [Vale](https://vale.sh/) aganist a specific file or project structure. 

```
#install
brew install vale

#Create Vale INI
#https://vale.sh/docs/vale-cli/structure/#valeini

cat <<EOF >>.vale.ini
StylesPath = styles

MinAlertLevel = suggestion
Vocab = Base

Packages = Microsoft, write-good

[*.md]
BasedOnStyles = Vale, Microsoft, write-good
EOF

#Vale Sync
vale sync

#Execute Vale
#cd into parent local folder if you want to validate all files.  

vale ./developer-hub/docs/**/*.md
```

## Navigation and Folder Structure
Powering the left navigation are [Docusaurus Sidbars](https://docusaurus.io/docs/sidebar) e.g `sidebar.js`. For new sections, this will have to be updated to accomomidate. For existing sections, certain sections are auto-generated by folder structure and certain landing pages are static.

## Sample Applications
If possible, we would like to persist sample applications in a [Sample Application
Repository](https://github.com/harness-apps/developer-hub). The Sample Application Repository has a similar [contributors guide](https://github.com/harness-apps/developer-hub/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md). 	

## Change Approval Flow
Harness Approvers will validate changes and approve the branch for merge into `main`. Once merged into `main`, the CI Process [Drone] will be kicked off automatically.
