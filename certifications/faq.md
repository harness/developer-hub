## Exam gets "Stuck"

### What should I do if my exam gets stuck on the "loading" screen?

If you encounter a "loading..." message followed by an error that says "There was a problem. Please try again later", your exam has gotten "stuck".

## Trouble with the Hands-On Exam

### I can't load/open the Hands-On portion of the exam, what should I do?

This usually occurs because right-click is not enabled on the exam. You can manually copy and paste the URL into a new tab to access the Hands-On portion. You can use `Command+C/Command+V` for Mac or `Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V` for Windows.

## Running Out of Time in Hands-On Exam

### What should I do if I'm running out of time or need to step away from the Hands-On exam?

Two options are available:

1. **Are You Still There?**: If you've been idle, an "Are you still there?" pop-up will appear. Click on the "I'm still here" button to restart the timer.
